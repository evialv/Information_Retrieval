Section 4434 of Public Law 102&hyph;484, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1993, amended section
6304(d) of title 5, United States Code, to consider the closure of an installation of the Department of Defense (DOD),
during the period from October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997, as ``an exigency of the public business'' for the
purpose of restoring annual leave accumulated in excess of the maximum permitted by law. This amendment also provides
that any annual leave in excess of the annual maximum limitation under 5 U.S.C. 6304(a) accrued by an employee at a closing
DOD installation must be restored and credited to the employee in a separate leave account. This provision enables
installations to keep their already reduced staffs at work while permitting employees to avoid forfeiture of leave.
In addition, it reduces the administrative time that would have been spent by employees and managers in scheduling,
canceling, and restoring ``use or lose'' annual leave each leave year.

Sections 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103&hyph;337, October 5, 1994, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal
year 1995, expanded 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) to cover employees of DOD installations identified as ``realigning locations''
under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (BRAC) and eliminated the time period for application of
5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) if the closure or realignment action is under BRAC. The October 1, 1992, through December 31, 1997,
time frame in 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) continues to apply to the closure of DOD installations not covered by BRAC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Time Limit for Using Restored Annual Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current 5 CFR 630.306, all restored leave must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year
ending 2 years after the termination date of the exigency of the public business_i.e., the closure or completion of
the realignment of the DOD installation and/or transfer of the employee to another installation or agency. Employees
remaining at closing DOD installations or BRAC designated realignment installations over several leave years may
accumulate large amounts of restored leave in their separate accounts. When the exigency of the public business terminates,
the employee must schedule and use all of the restored leave by the end of the leave year ending 2 years after the termination
date of the exigency of the public business. As a result, the employer must deal with the consequence of the employee
using sizeable amounts of leave within 2 to 3 years after the transfer or completion of the realignment. At the same
time, annual leave that accrues during that 2- to 3-year period routinely creates a ``use or lose'' situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help alleviate this situation, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising 5 CFR 630.306 to establish
a longer period of time for using annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) based on the amount of restored leave
in the employee's separate leave account. The time limit would be calculated using a formula similar to the formula
used for determining the time limit for using annual leave restored in back pay situations. (See 5 CFR 550.805(g).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the interim regulations, a full-time employee would be required to schedule and use excess annual leave of 416
hours or less by the end of the leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C.
6304(d)(3). The agency would extend that period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave
or any portion thereof. A part-time employee would be required to schedule and use excess annual leave in an amount
equal to or less than 20 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty by the end of the
leave year in progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency would
extend this period by 1 leave year for each additional number of hours of excess annual leave, or any portion thereof,
equal to 10 percent of the number of hours in the employee's scheduled annual tour of duty.

Movement From One DOD Installation Undergoing Closure or Realignment to Another Such Installation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current 5 CFR 630.306, the time limit for using annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) begins when
an employee moves from a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment, even if the employee
is transferring to another DOD installation subject to closure or realignment. This creates a situation that is directly
opposite to the result that 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) was intended to correct. Employees who move from one DOD installation
undergoing closure or realignment to another such installation without a break in service are under strict time constraints
to use their restored leave. At the same time, they are needed at work because of reduced staff levels. Supervisors
and managers may be hesitant to deny leave requests because restored leave that is forfeited cannot be recovered.
Further complicating the situation is the fact that these employees may be entitled to additional restored leave
under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM agrees with DOD's conclusion that the exigency of the public business that allows for the accrual of annual leave
above the annual maximum limitation does not terminate when an employee moves from one closing or realigning installation
to another such installation without a break in service. Therefore, OPM's regulations will defer starting the time
limit for using restored leave until the employee no longer works at a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation
undergoing realignment.

Movement to an Installation Undergoing Closure or Realignment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When an employee moves to a closing DOD installation or a DOD installation undergoing realignment, 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3)
only permits the restoration of annual leave that exceeds the annual maximum carry-over limitation. There is no similar
protection for an ``active'' restored annual leave account_i.e., an account of restored annual leave that was established
under other conditions permitting restoration of annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). Although the employee is needed
to work at the installation that is undergoing closure or realignment, the employee (and the agency) have little option
but to use (or permit the use of) the leave in the ``active'' restored leave account to avoid the forfeiture of annual
leave. This situation is also inconsistent with the overall intent of 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM's revision of &sect;630.306, as discussed above, will also alleviate this problem, since the time limitation
for using a restored leave account will be canceled for the entire period during which an employee is subject to 5 U.S.C.
6304(d)(3). After the employee's coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends, a new time limit will be established for
all restored leave available to the employee under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d). The new time limit for using restored leave will
begin on the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).

Advance Scheduling of Annual Leave
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current 5 CFR 630.308, before annual leave forfeited under section 6304 of title 5, United States Code, may
be considered for restoration under that section, use of the annual leave must have been scheduled in writing before
the start of the third biweekly pay period prior to the end of the leave year. Under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3), employees at
closing DOD installations or DOD installations undergoing realignment are permitted to have excess annual leave
restored without meeting the requirement for advance scheduling of annual leave.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOD has identified two problems that are encountered by an employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends
during the leave year. Some of these employees face forfeiting ``use or lose'' annual leave at the end of the leave year
at the new installation because they are unable to show any evidence of advance scheduling of annual leave. Other employees
request that a ``restored'' annual leave account be established at the time of their transfer or the completion of
the realignment of the DOD installation, even though accrued annual leave is not subject to forfeiture until the end
of the leave year. Under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d), excess annual leave cannot be considered for restoration until after the
end of the leave year in which it is forfeited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends late in the leave year may find it impossible to schedule
all annual leave that would be subject to forfeiture before the end of the leave year. DOD has requested that OPM amend
&sect;630.308 to allow agencies to consider restoration of annual leave forfeited at the end of the leave year to an
employee whose coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) ends during the leave year if the employee can demonstrate a correlation
between the lack of advance scheduling and coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM agrees that such annual leave may be considered for restoration. We have revised the regulations to require affected
employees to make a reasonable effort to comply with the advance scheduling requirement in 5 CFR 630.308(a). However,
the head of the agency may exempt employees from the advance scheduling requirement if the employee can show that he
or she was covered by 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3) during the leave year 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that he or she was unable to comply with the scheduling requirement due to circumstances beyond his or her control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an employee may be exempt from the advance scheduling requirement, this does not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
guarantee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the employee's excess annual leave will be restored, since there may have been sufficient time to schedule and
use his or her annual leave before the end of the leave year. Annual leave restored to the employee for the current leave
year is subject to the time limitations established in 5 CFR 630.306(a).

Sections 341 and 2816 of Public Law 103&hyph;337, which broadened coverage under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3), were effective
on October 5, 1994. In order to give practical effect to this legislation, I find good cause exists to waive the general
notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Also, I find that good cause exists for making this
rule effective in less than 30 days. The delay in the effective date is being waived to give affected employees the benefit
of these new provisions.

(a) Except as otherwise authorized under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section or other regulation, annual leave
restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) must be scheduled and used not later than the end of the leave year ending 2 years after:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The date of restoration of the annual leave forfeited because of administrative error; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A full-time employee shall schedule and use excess annual leave of 416 hours or less by the end of the leave year in
progress 2 years after the date the employee is no longer subject to 5 U.S.C. 6304(d)(3). The agency shall extend this
period by 1 leave year for each additional 208 hours of excess annual leave or any portion thereof.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends the Food Distribution Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to strengthen the provisions concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of donated food and to increase the uniformity between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions governing the State processing program and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Commodity Processing (NCP) Program. The changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in this final rule reflect the results of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national meetings: a meeting held to discuss ideas on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improving the administration of the State processing and the NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs and the Department's Paperwork Reduction Task Force 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting held to discuss ways to reduce the paperwork burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the processing programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Task Force in August 1990 and subsequently incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA's 1990 Report to Congress were included in this final

These programs are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance under 10.550 and are subject to the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart V and final rule-related notices published at 48 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29114, June 24, 1983 and 49 FR 22676, May 31, 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies which conflict with its provisions or which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhausted. This includes any administrative procedures provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by State or local governments. For disputes involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procurements by State agencies and sponsors, this includes any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative appeal procedures to the extent required by 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts 3015 or 3016. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Agriculture is committed to carrying out its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory and regulatory mandates in a manner that best serves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest. Therefore, where legal discretion permits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department actively seeks to promulgate regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promote economic growth, create jobs, are minimally burdensome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are easy for the public to understand, use or comply with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, the Department is committed to issuing regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize net benefits to society and minimize costs imposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Section 250.30 of the current Food Distribution Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations sets forth the terms and conditions under which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies, subdistributing agencies, and recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may enter into contracts with commercial firms for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing donated foods and prescribes the minimum requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be included in such contracts. Part 252 sets forth the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conditions under which the Food and Consumer Service (FCS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and commercial firms may enter into National Commodity Processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NCP) Program contracts for the processing and distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated donated foods to eligible recipient agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 25, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 29985) which would amend the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution Program regulations to strengthen provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the processing of donated foods and to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniformity between provisions governing State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, Part 250, and those governing NCP Program, Part 252. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule provided a 60-day comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule addresses those provisions regarding food service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management companies, contract renewal, requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing contracts, liquidated damages, alternate value pass-through systems, invoice information, substitution
of donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food, time frames for processors to pay refunds, refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications/performance reports, and list of contracting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please note that a typographical error in the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on May 25, 1993, (58 FR 29995) misidentified section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(k)(3) as section 250.30(k)(4). The Department apologizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any inconvenience this may have caused in reviewing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule for comment. Throughout this final rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct section number will be referred to when discussing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of that proposed rule in order to avoid further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion. However, the Department recognizes that the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 250.30(k)(4) is obsolete, in that it requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies to notify processors of the total amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated cheese they can receive during the 1988&hyph;1989 school year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this requirement is no longer pertinent to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program operations, the Department is removing this language from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations.

Analysis of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received a total of 41 comment letters from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies, local school food authorities, commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food processors, a State school food service association, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private sector representative, the American Commodity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution Association, and the American School Food Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 250.3 and 250.30(a) of the proposed rule would revise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the definition of ``processor'' and associated requirements to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove the blanket exception from the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations for commercial food service management companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed rule would revise the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``processor'' to exempt any commercial enterprises which handle, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare, and/or serve products or meals containing donated foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site solely for the individual recipient agency under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the removal of the blanket exception for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food service management companies from the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``processor,'' twenty-five comments were received. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters supported this proposal for the reasons set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble of the proposed rule. The Department proposed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change because of problems identified in the past when food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service management companies use commercial facilities to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items for the various school food authorities under contract.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations, it is often difficult to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if donated food is used to produce meals for the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency and if the value of the donated food is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in a reduction of the food service management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies' fees to the recipient agencies. Because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies are exempt from the processing regulations, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
little the distributing agency or recipient agency can do to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor commodity inventories. Based on the reasons set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble to the proposed rule and the overwhelming response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from commenters in favor of the proposal, the blanket exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of food service management companies from the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is eliminated from the section 250.3 definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``processor'' and &sect;250.30(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirty-three comments were received regarding the proposed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the definition of ``processor'' to exempt any commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enterprises which handle, prepare and/or serve products or meals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing donated foods on-site solely for the individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency under contract. Thirty-two commenters were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed to this change, primarily as it applied to recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Of this number, twenty-five commenters believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all recipient agencies providing meals to other recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, whether on-site or off-site, should be exempt from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor requirements of Part 250. Several commenters stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the use of commodities could be monitored satisfactorily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through existing food distribution review standards. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that recipient agencies should be exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this requirement if they provide for accountability and value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through for the donated food. This commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this could be accomplished by ensuring that funds obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meals furnished to other recipient agencies are deposited into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recipient agency's food service account. Other commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the proposed rule defining a school food authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which provides meals to summer feeding programs, child and adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day care centers, senior citizens and others as a processor is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not practical. One commenter stated that the definition could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected by adding a sentence to the definition that donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food recipient agencies which prepare their own meals on-site and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare meals for other recipient agencies at the same location 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also exempt from this definition. One commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools and child care centers should not be classified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food service management companies if they are eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for participation as recipient agencies in child nutrition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that many of the commenters' responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were based on the discussion in the preamble of the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which dealt with situations in which one recipient agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares meals for another recipient agency. A recipient agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which prepares meals for other recipient agencies is a food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service management company under the definition in &sect;250.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble stated that the Department believes that where a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprofit recipient agency, such as a school food authority, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepares products or meals containing donated foods for more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one recipient agency under more than one contract in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or prepares products or meals for any one recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency off-site, that recipient agency is operating as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food service management company and must comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing provisions of Part 250 pursuant to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to the definition of ``processor'' in &sect;250.3. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of the commenters stated that recipient agencies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare meals for other recipient agencies should be exempt from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being defined as a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the concerns raised by the commenters, however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``processor'' in &sect;250.3 of this final rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to provide that recipient agencies which prepare products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or meals containing donated foods for more than one recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency under more that one contract in the same facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare products or meals for any one recipient agency off-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are excluded from the definition of ``processor'' if the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency preparing products or meals can provide accountability for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any donated foods received from another recipient agency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;250.16 of the Food Distribution Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and any funds received as payment for preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products or meals shall be deposited in the meal account of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency preparing the products or meals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Fee-for-Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.3 of the proposed rule would define the term ``fee-for-service'' and delete the obsolete definition
of ``processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee''. Sections 250.30 (d) and (e) of the proposed rule would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reorganized to clarify refund, discount, hybrid and alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value pass-through systems and to incorporate procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billing fee-for-service end products. Additionally, under &sect;250.30(c)(4)(viii)(D) of the proposed rule
the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract would require those processors who wished to give credit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for by-products via a reduction in the fee-for-service price to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify in the contract the specific dollar value amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in the lowered price. Under &sect;250.30(e)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule, end products containing meat or poultry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with any other donated food, would be prohibited from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being delivered and sold to recipient agencies through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors under fee-for-service contracts. The proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would allow end products containing meat or poultry and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional ingredients which are not donated foods, to be sold to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agencies through distributors under fee-for-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. The proposed rule would also permit end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing meat or poultry, together with other donated food sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to recipient agencies by the processor, to be sold under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee-for-service contracts. FCS was particularly interested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and recommendations regarding the impact this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have on any products which were manufactured using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination of meat and poultry and other donated food and sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through distributors and possible alternatives to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule on this point. A total of fifteen comments was received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the above proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters responded to the proposed definition of ``fee-for-service.'' Four of these commenters agreed
with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition as it was proposed. The remaining four commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the definition needed to be expanded. Three of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters in favor of expansion stated that the fee-for-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price and the free on board (FOB) plant price are the same prices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and this should be reflected in the final rule. They stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FOB price is the actual cost of producing the end product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that this price should be the same for all States; the only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in price would be the cost of transportation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliver the finished end products back to each State. These same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters said that this concept would mean that each processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would only have to prepare one end product data schedule for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire nation. This action would make the idea of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearinghouse for end product data schedules become a reality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenter wanted the definition of fee-for-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded to clearly state that it is a method of payment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing services and is an alternative to a value pass-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, in addition to being the price representing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's cost of ingredients, packaging, and overhead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with the commenters that stated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOB price and the fee-for-service price represent the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures. The FOB price represents the processor's cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing an item prior to shipment and delivery. FOB pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the cost of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ingredients used in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product; the price reduction for donated food is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in the FOB price. Fee-for-service, on the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the cost of ingredients (other than donated food) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labor, packaging, overhead, and other costs incurred in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion of the donated food into the specified end product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net case price (the FOB price minus the commodity discount or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund for the donated food) and fee-for-service are equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices. The Department believes that the definition of fee-for-service is correct as written in the proposed rule,
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, the definition is adopted without change in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Four comments, all in favor, were received in response to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(4)(viii)(D) of the proposed rule which would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value credits of any by-products to be listed on the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product data schedule. Two of these commenters stated that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently require this information to be part of the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. This provision is adopted without change in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Only one comment, which was favorable, was received on section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(e)(1)(iv) of the proposed rule which would establish new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee-for-service billing procedures. Distributing agencies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been using the proposed fee-for-service billing procedures for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of years without problem pursuant to a policy memo dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 22, 1989. Therefore, this final rule contains these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Two commenters were in favor of section 250.30(e)(3) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule which would restrict the sale of end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing both substitutable and non-substitutable (meat and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poultry) donated food through distributors to either the refund, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hybrid, or alternate value pass-through system and nine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were opposed. Those who were opposed to the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted to have the option to approve the sale of end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing both substitutable and non-substitutable donated food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under fee-for-service arrangements. Additionally, several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were opposed to the use of the term ``sold'' in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(e)(3) of the proposed rule in regard to end products being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``sold'' to recipient agencies through distributors. They stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that fee-for-service end products should be delivered but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
sold 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to a distributor. One commenter stated that the word ``sold'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implied that any quantity of end product can be purchased by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency. That commenter further said that this is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast to the actual availability of a commodity and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation process that is associated with non-substitutable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities that is used by FCS and distributing agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Four comments were received on the impact that the proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make on end products manufactured from both substitutable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-substitutable donated food and delivered through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors. However, only one commenter provided a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to the proposed rule. That commenter stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since distributing agencies, and ultimately recipient agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive specific allocations of meat and poultry, the quantity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meat and poultry made available to a processor should be pre-assigned, based on a fair share apportionment and the
recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's choice. The pre-assigned end products may then be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returned to the recipient agency through a distributor. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fee-for-service billing process through a distributor for all end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products containing meat or poultry which are sold through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributor would be accomplished by either: 1) a dual billing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system through which the recipient agency is billed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor for the fee-for-service and the distributor bills for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the storage and delivery of end products or 2) a system through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the processor bills separately for the fee-for-service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distributor's storage and delivery charges. If these end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products should also contain substitutable foods, that portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value pass-through could be handled as a refund or discount, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated on the processor's invoice. Both types of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be shown on the end product data schedule. The other three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters pointed out the impact that the proposal would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without proposing alternatives. Their comments are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) if the proposed rule results in prohibiting end products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing protein from being sold via a distributor, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by a value pass-through system, it could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors leaving the program; 2) this proposed change may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in meat and poultry processors choosing not to utilize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated flour, oil, or other donated foods because they would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to choose a value pass-through system other than fee-for-service; 3) the use of fee-for-service is necessary
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of end products made with donated meat and poultry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the difficulty in replacing the donated product and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prohibition against substitution; and 4) it is uncertain as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to how the use of a refund or discount system instead of a fee-for-service could assure that there was no substitution
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial food for non-substitutable donated food. Due to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns raised by the commenters opposed to the proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 250.30(e)(3) of the proposed rule will not be adopted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule, and processing contracts may continue to be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under fee-for-service arrangements when such end products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivered and sold through distributors, regardless of whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are manufactured with both substitutable and non-substitutable donated foods.

Contract Extension

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under sections 250.30(c)(1) and 252.4(b) of the proposed rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing contracts would continue to be required to terminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on June 30 of each year; however, contracting agencies (or FCS in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of NCP) would be given the option of extending contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for two 1-year periods. Section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule would also require that any changed information be updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before any contract extension is granted, including pricing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield information, bonding information, and the signature page. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that contracts could be extended only if the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed satisfactorily during the previous year, submitted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required annual reconciliation reports and had its certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public accountant (CPA) audit report closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A total of eighteen commenters responded to this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven commenters supported the provision as proposed. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter supported the option of two 1-year extensions, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added that requiring processors to submit the annual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconciliation report and requiring the closure of the CPA audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as conditions for contract extension are not workable due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the submission and resolution time frames associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reports. Another commenter supported the option of two 1-year extensions but stated that the annual reconciliation
reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be eliminated as a condition since the proposal for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of the monthly performance report with year-to-date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
totals would serve the same purpose. Four commenters were in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
favor of contract extension but recommended four 1-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensions to make processing contract extensions consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food service management company contract duration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under 7 CFR Part 210. Three of these commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that bids should be separate and distinct from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing agreement and not be subject to automatic renewal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter stated that contract extensions would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in reduced paperwork because distributing agencies would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to maintain separate active contract files for each year of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the contract. This commenter added that if there were any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes from the original contract, the distributing agency would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to issue additional amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Department continues to believe sections 250.30(c)(1) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
252.4(b) of the proposed rule will reduce paperwork, facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract approval, and expedite the arrangement of early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity shipments directly to processors. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on section 250.30(c)(1) of the proposed rule, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department recognizes that the time frames for the submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of certain reports, such as the annual reconciliation report or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closure of the CPA audit report, cannot practically be conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contract extension. Annual reconciliation reports are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to be submitted to the distributing agencies until after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new contract year has begun. CPA audit reports are due prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extending a contract; however, the audit might not be closed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time of contract extension. Typically, distributing agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begin negotiating contracts for the upcoming contract year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March or April. Because distributing agencies need to have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most recent data available to them in determining whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing contract should be extended, this rule will require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that distributing agencies ensure that any changed information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be updated before any contract extension is granted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including but not limited to pricing and yield information value, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonding information, and signature page. The distributing agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also must ensure that all required reports and any corrections to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports that are due up to the time that contract extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs have been submitted by the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, this final rule adopts section 250.30(c)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed State processing regulations and section 252.4(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed NCP regulations without change, except that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(1) is modified to provide that as a condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

reports and any corrections to such reports up to the time that

Section 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and section 252.4(c)(1) of the NCP regulations would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate the requirement that the free on board (FOB) plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price be included as part of the State processing and NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts. In lieu of the FOB price, the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit processors to provide any pricing information, so long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor thoroughly explained what this additional pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information represented. The processor, however, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule would also be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include the contract value of each USDA commodity and where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing was to be performed only on a fee-for-service basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined in the rule, the actual fee would be listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, section 250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that information pertaining to yields and pricing of end

A total of sixteen comments was received on this proposal. In response to the proposal to eliminate the FOB price from
the end product data schedule, six commenters agreed that it should be removed from the regulations and four commenters
stated that it should be retained. Commenters who supported the elimination of the FOB price stated that there is a
great deal of confusion regarding what the FOB price represents. One commenter stated that FOB prices are misleading
and believed it would be better to have a processor spell out the pricing mechanism as clearly as possible at the State
contract level. Two commenters proposed eliminating all pricing information from the end product data schedule.
One of these commenters stated that the FOB price causes confusion among recipient agencies and also reveals sensitive
information to a company's competitors should they obtain copies of the end product data schedule. The other commenter
stated that the FOB price is irrelevant and unauditable and there is no accurate means to compare price information
on the end product data schedule to actual price paid by the recipient agency. This same commenter said that the majority
of recipient agencies arrange for purchases through a bid process, and that the competitive market will control the
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this commenter stated that it would be better to eliminate the FOB price entirely and satisfy the audit
trail through: 1) payment of a refund which reflects the contract value; 2) documentation that the distributor reduced
the commercial price of the end product by the full contract value under the hybrid system; or 3) that the normal commercial
price has been discounted by the full contract value for sales made under the direct discount system. Another commenter
stated that only value pass-through information should be included on the end product data schedule and that full
pricing information, such as delivered price, should be included as a separate attachment to the agreement. Three
commenters supported the current requirement and indicated that delivery costs should also be identified on the
end product data schedule. Two commenters recommended that FOB price and fee-for-service definitions should be
clarified so that they are compatible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCS is aware that pricing information supplied by processors often represents prices other than the FOB price. Many
processors use delivered price to a State warehouse, highest price that can be charged to a recipient agency, delivered
price to a recipient agency, etc. Based on this and the comments received, the Department believes that the requirement
that FOB price be included as part of the State and NCP processing contracts should be eliminated. However, because
the Department realizes that pricing information is very important to recipient agencies, the Department also believes
that processors should provide any pricing information requested by the contracting agency, along with a thorough
explanation of what this information represents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the proposal to place price and yield data on separate pages, four commenters were in favor of this idea and
seven were opposed. Those in favor stated that a two-part system could result in reduced paperwork and that processors
would not be required to submit new yield schedules for contract renewal or pricing changes. Another commenter stated
that if preparing a separate sheet for yields will lead to a uniform commodity yield allowances and these are clearly
related to end product, then the proposed changes may be desirable. That commenter further stated that the yield data
should be cross-referenced on the end product data schedule. Those commenters opposed to the proposed requirement
stated that placing price and yield data on separate pages doubles the paperwork required, not reduces it. Several
commenters stated that most processors have end product data schedules computerized, so it would be easier and more
efficient to create revised yield and pricing information on a single sheet. One commenter stated that the specific
reference to a two-part form should be removed from the regulations, but its removal would not prevent the use of a two-part
form if this is preferred by the processor and the distributing agency. Another commenter opposed the proposal to
have yield and pricing information on separate pages of the contract and preferred to have the gross and net pricing
columns eliminated from the current end product data schedule and leave the rest of the end product data schedule as
it currently exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposed placing pricing and yield data on separate pages because it was thought that this would eliminate
the need to update all end product data schedules when changes become necessary. However, the Department finds the
arguments made by the commenters opposed to the proposal persuasive, in that placing the information on separate
pages would increase the workload and paperwork for processors and distributing agencies. Additionally, with the
increased use of computer technology, it would be easier to update the end product data schedule rather than requiring
separate pages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts &sect;250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the proposed State processing regulations and &sect;252.4(c)(1)
of the proposed NCP regulations without change, except that the proposal to require that price and yield data be placed
on separate pages is not incorporated into &sect;250.30(c)(4)(ii) of the final rule.

Liquidated Damages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.30(c)(4)(iv)(B) of the current State processing regulations provides for termination of the processing
contract when there has been noncompliance with its terms and conditions by the contracting agency or the processor.
However, it has been the Department's experience that there have been circumstances where termination of processing
contracts would seriously affect the ability of recipient agencies to purchase processed end products. Rather than
terminating contracts for non-compliance with the contract provisions, the Department believes that there could
be some middle ground established where instances of non- compliance could be better handled by means of assessing
damages against the non-performing party of the contract under the State processing program. To accomplish this,
the proposed rule requested comments from interested parties on ways to handle instances of program violations,
short of contract termination. Commenters were requested to identify areas of non-compliance that have created
the greatest problems in the past as well as the type and amounts of reasonable damages for non-compliance with specific
provisions of the processing agreement to be applied against a processor. These liquidated damages were to be based
on the severity and nature of the program violations identified, in order to ensure consistent application of the
requirement. Additionally, comments were solicited regarding the incorporation of the liquidated damages provision
of the NCP agreement into the NCP regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve comments were received in response to this proposal. Ten commenters were opposed to the inclusion of a liquidated
damages provision in the State processing and the NCP regulations. Many of these commenters stated that while the
concept of establishing conditions of non-compliance in lieu of contract termination could be useful as an incentive
for processors to adhere to contract requirements, addressing these conditions in Federal regulations is not appropriate.
Rather than include such provisions in Federal regulations, six commenters stated that distributing agencies should
be encouraged to identify liquidated damages assessments in a special provisions article of the processing agreement.
Three commenters expressed concern that inclusion of a liquidated damages provision could deter processors from
participating in the processing programs. Three commenters expressed concern that State laws are too varied and
that such provisions may invoke unnecessary or excessive charges against processors, which could ultimately result
in higher fees charged to recipient agencies. One commenter stated that most instances of non-compliance fall into
the area of recordkeeping problems, such as failure to submit reports in a timely manner or to maintain production
records. The commenter stated that the best way to handle such occurrences is for the distributing agency to work directly
with the processor to resolve these problems rather than to impose fines. Two commenters stated that adding a liquidated
damages provision to the NCP regulations would create undue hardship on a single processor with contracts in multiple
states. Three commenters stated that there was no need for a liquidated damages provision because the bond was sufficient
to cover the loss of any donated food. However, a different view point toward the bond coverage was expressed by two
commenters who were in favor of including a liquidated damages provision. One of these commenters stated that since
the bond only covers loss of inventory or loss of commodity, a liquidated damages provision would be appropriate if
very carefully written so that good processors would not be deterred from program participation and that such a provision
could not be punitive in nature. The other commenter in favor of a liquidated damages provision stated that while performance
bonds do provide some relief, they do not adequately compensate the State or the recipient agencies for the additional
administrative work which can result when a processor violates the provisions of the processing regulations and
agreement provisions. This commenter stated that a well-constructed liquidated damages provision may enable the
distributing agency to collect penalties which could be used to offset the administrative work that is generated
by such violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department recognizes the need to have a means of addressing non-compliance with program and contract provisions,
other than contract termination, the majority of the commenters' recommendations stated that it would be inappropriate
for the Department to develop a liquidated damages provision that would be applicable to all distributing agencies
nationwide. Based on these comments, the Department believes that handling such instances of non-compliance is
best left to the discretion of the distributing agencies. Therefore, this rule does not require that a liquidated
damages provision be included in the State processing contract. However, as a means of ensuring compliance with all
requirements of the processing contract short of contract termination, the Department strongly encourages the
inclusion of a liquidated damages provision or other similar provision in the processing contract. As discussed
in the preamble to the proposed State processing regulations, there are circumstances in which termination of processing
contracts would seriously affect the ability of recipient agencies to purchase processed end products, and thus,
termination is not always a practical option for less significant contract noncompliance. It has been the Department's
experience in NCP that a liquidated damages provision has been a useful method of ensuring full compliance with the
terms of the contract. The Department will continue to appraise the use and effectiveness of liquidated damage provisions
or other intermediate alternatives to contract termination by distributing agencies and will address this issue
in the future if warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since FCS serves as the distributing agency in the NCP Program, and because this provision has been successfully applied
in the past to address instances of non-compliance, the liquidated damages article that is currently part of the NCP
agreement will remain unchanged. The Department plans to raise this issue with the distributing agencies participating
in the State processing program to determine whether it is appropriate to incorporate a similar provision in State
processing contracts.

Section 250.30(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4)(iii) of the proposed
NCP regulations would permit FCS to take the paperwork and resource burden associated with using the alternate value
pass-through systems into consideration when determining whether an alternate system should be approved. The proposed
rule would also reserve to FCS the right to deny approval of systems which are labor- intensive and provide no greater
accountability than systems specifically described for use by the current regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A total of twelve comments was received on this proposal, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ten commenters being in favor of the provision, one commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being opposed, and one commenter possibly misunderstanding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed provision. Six of the ten commenters supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision exactly as proposed, while the remaining four made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional suggestions for inclusion in the provision. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional suggestions were as follows: 1) the Department must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop specific objective guidelines to follow when reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate value pass-through systems to ensure that all systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are evaluated under the same criteria; 2) the Department must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the burden an alternate system would place on smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors, since they would probably have to use that system in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State where it had been approved; and 3) any alternate value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through system should be piloted for one year before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving full approval and reviewed every year thereafter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that it is an accountable and efficient system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that one commenter may have misunderstood the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, since concern was expressed that the Department was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to eliminate the option of allowing alternate value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through systems. Finally, the one commenter who was opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the provision stated that there was no need for this proposal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the Department already has the authority to approve or deny 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative value pass-through systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department supports the continued use of alternate value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pass-through systems with FCS approval under the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and NCP Programs. The Department also supports the proposal that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the paperwork and resource burden associated with an alternate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value pass-through system are extremely important factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be taken into consideration when determining whether an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate system should be approved. The Department believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that distributing agencies, recipient agencies, and processors do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have the time or resources to dedicate to alternate systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are more labor-intensive and provide no greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accountability than systems currently described for use by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since there has been little interest expressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agencies in using alternate value pass-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, the Department does not believe it would be practical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop specific guidelines for use in evaluating such systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, there have only been three requests to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternate systems. While two of these systems were approved for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in the State processing program, only one is currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. Instead, the Department finds that it is more effective to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate all requests to use alternate system value pass-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems on a case-by-case basis, making sure that, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the alternate system under consideration complies with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification requirements contained in section 250.19(b)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Food Distribution Program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts section 250.30(d)(1)(iii) of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State processing regulations and section 252.4(c)(4)(iii) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCP regulations without change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would eliminate the requirement under sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(d)(2) and 250.30(e)(2) of the State processing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and section 252.4(c)(4) of the NCP regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor/distributor invoices must indicate the amount of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount included or refund due the recipient agencies for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end products purchased, regardless of the type of value pass-through system used. Sections 250.30.(d)(3) and 250.30(e)(2)
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule would also require processors to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing information summaries to contracting agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contracting agencies would be required to provide these pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information summaries to recipient agencies as soon as possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after contract approval by the distributing agency. If any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing information changed during the contract year, processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required to provide updated pricing information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summaries to the contracting agencies 30 days prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date. The contracting agencies, in turn, would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to provide the updated summaries to the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Section 250.30(c)(4)(xvii) of the proposed State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing regulations would create the affirmative duty of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor to provide these pricing summaries and updated pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summaries. Under the NCP program, section 252.4(c)(4) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would require processors to provide pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information summaries directly to the recipient agencies as soon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible after FCS contract approval. Also, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
252.4(c)(4) of the proposed rule would require that if any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing information changes during the contract year, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must provide updated pricing information summaries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCS and the recipient agencies 30 days prior to the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of such change.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eight commenters were in favor of eliminating the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processor ensure that invoices clearly show the discount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included or refund due to the recipient agencies for the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product purchased. Commenters provided two main reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishing to eliminate this requirement: 1) it has proved very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to require distributors to identify refunds due or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discounts given on the invoices and 2) the requirement had become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somewhat obsolete because FCS policy currently allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors/distributors to provide pricing summaries to recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies in lieu of providing the pricing information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoices. Five commenters were opposed to the proposal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that they wanted to retain the pricing information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the invoices because the invoice is the best place to alert 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agencies that a refund is due or a discount has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given. One commenter added that many processors who utilize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund system provide a pre-printed rebate application which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lists the commodity value for each end product. Two commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that the proposed rule would have little, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on their operations. Only one comment was received on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes proposed for the NCP Program. That commenter endorsed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed provisions in section 252.4(c)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, several processors and distributors have expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern to FCS about the added cost of redesigning and reprinting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoices in order to accommodate the requirement in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations that the processor/distributor invoices clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate the discount included or the refund due on end products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the growing concern, on May 2, 1989, FCS issued a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy memorandum which allowed processors or distributors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide recipient agencies a fact sheet, which clearly identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processed end products are made from commodities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates the amount of refund or discount due eligible recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies for such purchases. The Department believes it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to incorporate this existing policy into the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. These pricing information summaries need only consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information such as the product code, gross price, refund due or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discount given and net price. These summaries, as well as any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updates to the summaries, must be prepared by processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to recipient agencies by either the processor or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, this final rule adopts sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(c)(4)(xvii), 250.30(d)(3) and 250.30(e)(2)of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.30(f)(1)(i), of the proposed rule would allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution of commercial food for those donated foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically listed as substitutable in the current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without requesting prior approval from the distributing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, sections 250.30(f)(1)(iii), 250.30(f)(2), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
250.30(f)(4) of the proposed State processing regulations include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following provisions: 1) Processors may continue to request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval from FCS to substitute other commercial foods (except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meat and poultry), although without the requirement that requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be made only when the distributing agency's inability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain the necessary inventory of donated food at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plant would disrupt the production of end products and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in all cases in which a State processing contract permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution, provided that processors must provide documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to substantiate that they continue to acquire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient substitutable commercial foods necessary to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent yield requirement; 2) Distributing agencies can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withhold deliveries of donated food from processors which have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced their level of commercial production because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in the State processing program; and 3)

contracts currently entered into by the processor. Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
252.3(c) and 252.4(c)(7) of the proposed rule would similarly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend the NCP regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received sixteen comments on this proposal. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters concurred that processors should not need written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval from the distributing agency to substitute those donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods listed as substitutable in the regulations with commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods. However, two commenters stated that the Department should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider making all donated foods substitutable and one commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that all donated food, except for meat and poultry, should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered as substitutable. Those commenters who favored a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total or almost total substitution of all donated foods provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which substitution should be permitted: 1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service inspectors and/or USDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agricultural Marketing Service graders verify that the commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food being substituted is of equal or better quality and is of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same generic identity as the donated food; 2) the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must provide the specifications of the commercial food used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute for donated food, along with a certification that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted foods are of equal or better quality; and 3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must report all substitution on the monthly performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report to the distributing agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were received in response to the proposal which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would permit distributing agencies to withhold deliveries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated food from processors who have reduced their level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial production because of participation in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing program. These commenters made it clear that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe distributing agencies do not have access to a processor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records on the production of commercial end products in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether withholding donated food is appropriate. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor expressed concern that the documentation necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantiate that the processor acquires sufficient amounts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutable donated food would increase the overall workload of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distributing agency staff.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department supports the commenters who recommended that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
donated foods currently listed in the regulations be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as substitutable with commercial foods without prior approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the distributing agency. However, the Department does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agree that all donated foods should be considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitutable. The Department purchases high quality products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which must meet strict specifications for recipient agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in their meal service operations. Because the quality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-listed donated foods, especially meat and poultry, can vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tremendously, which will ultimately affect the quality of the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, the Department believes it is necessary to eliminate any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility that inferior commercial product could be substituted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the high quality donated foods provided by USDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the argument that Federal inspectors or graders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could ensure the quality of any commercial product being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted for donated food is not reasonable. Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspectors or graders are only present in processing plants that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convert donated meat or poultry into finished end products; they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not required to be on-site in bakeries or processing plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which only handle fruits, vegetables and/or grains. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional costs for obtaining the services of inspectors or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graders to perform these services would be extremely high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, based on the comments received, it is apparent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters do not favor requiring distributing agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor the level of the processors's commercial production so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they would be permitted to withhold deliveries of donated food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from processors which have reduced their level of commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production because of participation in the State processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts sections 250.30(f)(1)(i) and 250.30(f)(4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed State processing regulations without change. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alleviate the commenters' concerns, but to maintain the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program accountability, section 250.30(f)(1)(iii) of this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule will require the processor to be responsible for maintaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that normal commercial production has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced as the result of participation in the processing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conform to the change in section 250.30(f)(1)(iii), this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule also adds a new paragraph to section 250.30(c)(4)(xviii) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule. This final rule adopts section 250.30(f)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed State processing regulations as proposed with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor modification for clarification. Additionally, this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule adopts sections 252.3(c) and 252.4(c)(7) of the proposed NCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations without change.

Time Frames for Processors to Pay Refunds

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 250.30(k)(3) of the proposed State processing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require processors to make refund payments to recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies within 30 days after receipt of any refund application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, sections 250.30(k)(1) and 252.4(c)(4)(i)(B) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule would also permit recipient agencies to file refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications on a Federal fiscal quarterly basis, if the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated refund due for all purchases from that processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. Furthermore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors would be permitted to group together refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for a single recipient agency on a Federal fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis if the total anticipated refund due that recipient agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the quarter is 25 dollars or less. These quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options of batching of refund applications and refund payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would only be permitted between a recipient agency and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, not between a distributor and a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 16 comments was received on this proposal. Regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 30-day time frame for processors to pay refunds, twelve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters stated that they agreed with this concept and three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters were opposed. Many of those commenters that supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 30-day time frame did so for the following reasons: 1) a 30-day time frame is more realistic and logical than the
10-day time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame; 2) a 30-day time frame conforms to time frames used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal business practices; 3) a 10-day time frame is very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to meet because of limited staff resources; and 4) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30-day time frame is reasonable because a refund payment will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually be received by the recipient agency before the recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's payment for the end products reaches the processor. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three commenters who expressed opposition to the 30-day time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame stated that it allows the processor to use school food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority money for an excessive period of time. One processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also stated that the current 10-day time frame is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate because it is the key to acceptance of the refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system by recipient agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourteen comments were received regarding quarterly batching of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund applications by recipient agencies and twelve comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were received on quarterly batching of refund payments by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors. While all comments received on the concept of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarterly batching were favorable, three commenters made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following suggestions: 1) the threshold should be increased from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25 dollars to 100 dollars; 2) there should be no minimum dollar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold associated with quarterly submission of refund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications by recipient agencies; 3) recipient agencies should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an option to file refund applications monthly or quarterly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and processors must provide refunds within 30 days of receipt of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the refund application; and 4) to accommodate extenuating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, distributing agencies should permit recipient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to submit refund applications and processors to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refund payments outside of the quarterly time frames. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the reasons set forth above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule adopts sections 250.30(k)(1) and 250.30(k)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed State processing and section 252.4(c)(4)(i)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed NCP regulations without change.

Section 250.30(k)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would eliminate the requirement that recipient agencies must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forward copies of the refund applications to distributing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies at the same time they submit the refund applications to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor. Section 250.30(m)(1) of the proposed rule would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also amend the State processing regulations to add the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements: 1) that monthly performance reports be postmarked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no later than the final day of the month following the reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period and the final performance report for the contract period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be postmarked no later than 60 days from the close of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract year; and 2) that performance reports must be submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly unless a processor made no sales and had no inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during that month. Finally, section 250.17 of the proposed State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing regulations would provide that where performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports are electronically transmitted to the distributing agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by means of a facsimile machine, the date printed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facsimile machine on the facsimile copy may serve as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postmark. The Department received seventeen comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ten comments were received on eliminating the requirement that recipient agencies submit copies of the refund applications
to the distributing agencies. All commenters were in favor of the proposal, stating that the elimination of this dual
reporting requirement would reduce the paperwork burden. Since section 250.30(k)(3) of the current State processing
regulations also requires processors to send copies of the refund applications and refund payments to the distributing
agency as part of the monthly performance report, the requirement for recipient agencies to also send the refund applications
to the distributing agencies was viewed as duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten comments were received regarding the use of the postmark date to track the timing for submission of the monthly
performance reports. Nine commenters were in favor of the proposed change and one opposed. Those in favor stated that
by placing this requirement in the regulations, any uncertainties about the required time frames for submission
of the performance reports would be clarified. The one commenter opposed to this provision stated that upon receipt,
each performance report is stamp-dated when received and that the envelope containing the postmark is discarded,
because it is not practical to keep mailing envelopes on file. The Department wishes to clarify that the intent of this
requirement was not for distributing agencies to maintain mailing envelopes. Rather, distributing agencies should
record the postmark date that is on the mailing envelope and determine whether the performance report has been submitted
within the required time frame. All comments received on the proposal that the date printed on a report transmitted
by facsimile machine may serve as the postmark date were favorable; however, one commenter questioned whether it
is necessary to include such a policy in regulations. The Department believes that it is important to state within
the regulations that the date printed by the facsimile machine may serve as the postmark date, since this method of
submitting performance reports is becoming more commonplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were generally opposed to the proposed requirement that processors would not have to submit performance
reports for those months in which no sales were made and where processors had no inventory. Fifteen comments were received
on this provision. Four commenters were in complete agreement, one commenter was in favor but with restrictions,
and ten commenters opposed. Those in complete agreement with the proposal did not provide further explanation for
their support. However, the one commenter in partial agreement with the proposal recommended that the requirement
be eliminated when processors have no inventory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
no sales activity, but stipulated that upon arrival of any inventory or initiation of any approved sales from that
period on, monthly performance reports be required. Those commenters who wished to require monthly performance
reports for each month the processing contract is in effect provided the following reasons: (1) Distributing agencies
often do not know if a processor has inventory or has made any sales during the month until the monthly report is received;
(2) it would be difficult to know if a report was required, if a report was submitted but lost in the mail, if the processor
forgot to submit the report, or if the processor purposely did not send the report; (3) distributing agencies may not
know the status of a processor's inventory because incoming direct shipments of donated food may not arrive when anticipated
or product can be backhauled without the distributing agency's knowledge; (4) monthly reports must be maintained
to establish an audit trail; (5) auditable records should run consecutively without breaks in months; and (6) if the
Department eliminates the annual reconciliation report, distributing agencies, FCS and auditors must have the
monthly performance reports for each month the processing agreement is in effect in order to verify all activities
that occurred during the agreement period. One commenter added that processors should always have sales activity
each month because the current processing regulations discourage processors from entering into agreements if their
activity will be limited. The Department finds the commenters' arguments persuasive that monthly performance reports
be required for each month that the processing agreement is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the above reasons, this final rule adopts sections 250.17(f), 250.30(k)(1) and
250.30(m)(1) of the proposed State processing regulations without change, except that the proposal in section 250.30(m)(1)
that processors would not be required to submit performance reports for those months in which no sales were made and
where processors had no inventory is not included in this final rule.

As part of the performance report requirements under section 250.30(m) of the current State processing regulations,
processors are required to submit to the distributing agency a list of all contracting agencies and their locations
with which the processor has processing contracts. Because the Department believes that requiring this list every
month is unnecessary and duplicative, the proposed rule would eliminate this list.

Additionally, in order to ensure that sales are only made to eligible recipient agencies with approved processing
contracts, &sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) of the current regulations requires that as part of the processing contract,
the contracting agency must provide the processor with a list of all recipient agencies eligible to purchase end products
under the contract. However, the current rule implies, but does not explicitly require, the contracting agency to
provide updates to the list of recipient agencies for any changes that occur during the contract period. Therefore,
to clarify the regulation, &sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) of the proposed rule would require the contracting agency to
provide updates to the list of recipient agencies for any changes which occur during the contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixteen comments were received on these two proposals, all in favor of the provisions as proposed. Accordingly, this
final rule adopts &sect;&sect;250.30(c)(4)(xv) and 250.30(m) of the proposed State processing regulations without
change.

Quarterly Processing Activity Reports and Annual Reconciliation Reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule provided for major revisions in the areas of quarterly inventory reports, the annual reconciliation
report and the monthly performance reports. Sections 250.30(m)(1), 250.30(n) (3) and (4), and 250.30(o)(1) proposed
to amend the State processing regulations as follows: 1) the quarterly inventory reports and the annual reconciliation
report would be replaced with the monthly performance reports with year-to-date totals; 2) distributing agencies
would be required to forward to the FCS Regional Office the monthly performance report with year-to-date totals provided
by the processor for the last month of each Federal fiscal quarter; 3) when forwarding these monthly performance reports,
they would be required to be postmarked no later than 60 days following the close of each Federal fiscal quarter, except
that such reports must be postmarked no later than 90 days following the close of the contract period; 4) when a processor
submitted no monthly performance report for the last month of a Federal fiscal quarter, distributing agencies would
be required to submit to the FCS Regional Office the last monthly performance report received from the processor for
that Federal fiscal quarter; 5) the last monthly performance report for the contract period would serve as the annual
reconciliation report; 6) distributing agencies would be required to certify the accuracy of the information contained
in the final performance report; and 7) when a processor submitted no monthly performance report for the last month
of the contract period, the last monthly performance report received from the processor would serve as the annual
reconciliation report and this final performance report would be required to be postmarked no later than 90 days following
the close of the contract period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen comments were received on the above provisions contained in the proposed rule. Regarding the replacement
of the quarterly inventory reports with the monthly performance reports, seven comments were received, four in favor
and three opposed. However, based on comments received, it appears that some commenters may have misunderstood the
purpose for replacing the quarterly inventory reports with the monthly performance reports with year-to-date totals.
Under the current regulations, performance reports are required to contain inventory information on a monthly basis,
but not on a quarterly basis. Distributing agencies are required to extract inventory information from the performance
reports and compile this information on a quarterly basis for submission to the FCS Regional Office. Requiring that
performance reports have year-to-date totals of inventory information would eliminate the need for distributing
agency staff to prepare a quarterly inventory report. This reduces the workload of the distributing agency staff
and only requires a small change in the processor's performance report format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, it was not the intent of the Department that distributing agencies photocopy the entire content of the
performance report for submission to the FCS Regional Office. While sales activity for the month usually comprises
the major part of the performance report, processors typically show inventory activity on a separate page of the monthly
performance report. On the inventory summary portion of the performance report, all sales are represented by a single
inventory drawdown figure which represents the cumulative total of all individual sales reported for the month.
The intent of the proposed rule was for distributing agencies to send the inventory summary portion of the December,
March and June performance reports that contains the inventory information (i.e., beginning inventory, receipts
for the month, transfers in and out, inventory drawdown, and ending inventory balance with year-to-date totals)
to the FCS Regional Offices, and not the entire performance report.

Twelve commenters were in favor of replacing the annual reconciliation report with the last monthly performance
report with year-to-date totals, and two commenters were opposed. Those in favor stated that this proposal is a positive
step toward reducing paperwork, while those opposed stated it would increase paperwork because distributing agencies
would be required to certify the accuracy of the performance reports. In its review of this proposal and the comments
received, the Department believes this proposal will serve to reduce paperwork. Under the current regulations for
annual reconciliation, processors must total donated food receipts, transfer information, sales activity, and
ending inventory balance from the individual performance reports. Under the proposed rule, it would not be necessary
for processors to go through previous performance reports and compute these figures, since this information will
be tallied cumulatively each month. Additionally, submitting performance reports with year-to-date totals will
eliminate the need for distributing agencies to compile data from the individual quarterly reports to ensure that
the annual reconciliation report figures are accurate. The final performance report for the contract year, including
a summary sheet of year-to-date inventory totals, will replace the annual reconciliation report formerly required
in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed concern that the time frames for submitting the performance reports with year-to-date totals
to FCS are the same time frames currently required for submission of the quarterly inventory reports. That commenter
indicated that if there were errors in the report, there would not be sufficient time for the processor to make the corrections
and return the report to the distributing agency in order for the distributing agency to submit it to the FCS Regional
Office on time. The Department believes that since most performance reports are computer-generated, and the calculation
of the year-to-date totals would be performed by a formula placed into the computer program, there would be very few
errors made. Furthermore, the Department believes that it is better to handle any errors that might be discovered
on performance reports on a case-by-case basis. Distributing agencies will be required to certify that the inventory
information contained in the final performance report is accurate, just as they are required to do under section 250.30(n)(4)
of the current rule for the annual reconciliation report. The time frames for submission of the performance reports,
as discussed earlier in this preamble, will remain the same as in the proposed rule and are clearly spelled out in the
final rule under section 250.30(m)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in this preamble under Refund Applications/Performance Reports, section 250.30(m)(1) of
the proposed rule stated that processors are not required to submit performance reports for those months in which
no sales were made and those months where processors had no inventory. As previously discussed, this provision is
not included in the final rule. Therefore, the provisions in sections 250.30(n)(3) and 250.30(o)(1) of the proposed
State processing regulation, which would provide that when a processor does not submit a monthly performance or inventory
report for the last month of a Federal fiscal quarter, the distributing agency must forward to the FCS Regional Office
the last monthly performance report received from the processor for that quarter, are not included in this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule adopts sections 250.30(m)(1), 250.30(n) (3) and (4), and 250.30(o)(1) of the proposed State processing
regulations without change, except as previously noted. FCS plans to develop a prototype performance report format
which will be easily adaptable for processors to incorporate into existing inventory reporting programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section of the proposed rule did not affect the NCP Program.

requirements specified in &sect;250.19(b) of this part, or an alternative verification system approved by FCS.
The Department retains the authority to inspect and review all pertinent records including records pertaining to
the verification of a statistically valid sample of sales. FCS may consider the paperwork and resource burden associated
with alternative value pass-through systems when considering approval and reserves the right to deny the approval

in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section and the price of each unit of end product purchased by eligible recipient
agencies through a distributor shall be discounted by the contract value of the donated foods contained therein;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) An alternative value pass-through system under which the contract value of the donated food contained in each

agency for the storage and delivery of the end products; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The processor arranges for the delivery of end products through a distributor on behalf of the recipient agency.
In this system, the processor's invoice must include both the fee-for-service and the distributor's charges as separate,
clearly identifiable charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Processors shall provide pricing information summaries to contracting agencies and contracting agencies shall
provide this information to recipient agencies as soon as possible after contract approval. If this pricing information
changes during the contract period, the processor shall provide updated pricing information to the contracting
agency, which, in turn, shall provide this information to the eligible recipient agencies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency shall submit a refund application to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor within 30 days of receipt of the processed end product,

within 30 days of receipt of the refund application from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recipient agency, an amount equal to the established agreement

Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the processor seeks FCS approval to substitute donated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfat dry milk with concentrated skim milk under paragraph (c)(7)(i)(A) of this section, an addendum must be added
to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request which states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The percent of milk solids that, at a minimum, must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the concentrated skim milk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The weight ratio of concentrated skim milk to donated nonfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry milk: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The weight ratio is the weight of concentrated skim milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which equals one pound of donated nonfat dry milk, based on milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) In calculating this weight, nonfat dry milk shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered as containing 96.5 percent milk solids; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) If more than one concentration of concentrated skim milk is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used, a separate weight ratio must be specified for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The processor's method of verifying that the milk solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content in the concentrated skim milk is as stated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A requirement that the concentrated skim milk shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced in a USDA approved plant or in a plant approved by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate regulatory authority for the processing of Grade A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk products; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) A requirement that the contact value of donated food for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given amount of concentrated skim milk used to produce an end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is the value of the equivalent amount of donated nonfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry milk, based on the weight ratio of the two foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Substitution must not be made solely for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selling or disposing of the donated commodity in commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channels for profit.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is amending its risk-based capital guidelines to recognize
the risk-reducing benefits of qualifying bilateral netting contracts. This final rule implements a recent revision
to the Basle Accord permitting the recognition of such netting arrangements. The effect of the final rule is that state
member banks and bank holding companies (banking organizations, institutions) may net positive and negative mark-to-market
values of interest and exchange rate contracts in determining the current exposure portion of the credit equivalent
amount of such contracts to be included in risk-weighted assets.

The Basle Accord
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 established a risk-based capital framework which was implemented for state member banks and bank holding companies
by the Board in 1989. Under this framework, off-balance-sheet interest rate and exchange rate contracts (rate contracts)
are incorporated into risk weighted assets by converting each contract into a credit equivalent amount. This amount
is then assigned to the appropriate credit risk category according to the identity of the obligor or counterparty
or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The credit equivalent amount of an interest or exchange
rate contract can be assigned to a maximum credit risk category of 50 percent.

The Basle Accord is a risk-based framework that was proposed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle
Supervisors' Committee) and endorsed by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten (G&hyph;10) countries in July
1988. The Basle Supervisors' Committee is comprised of representatives of the central banks and supervisory authorities
from the G&hyph;10 countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,
the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Luxembourg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is determined by adding together the current replacement cost (current
exposure) and an estimate of the possible increase in future replacement cost in view of the volatility of the current
exposure over the remaining life of the contract (potential future exposure, also referred to as the add-on).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This method of determining credit equivalent amounts for rate contracts is identified in the Basle Accord as the current
exposure method, which is used by most international banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For risk-based capital purposes, a rate contract with a positive mark-to-market value has a current exposure equal
to that market value. If the mark-to-market value of a rate contract is zero or negative, then there is no replacement
cost associated with the contract and the current exposure is zero. The original Basle Accord and the Board's guidelines
provided that current exposure would be determined individually for each rate contract entered into by a banking
organization; institutions generally were not permitted to offset, that is, net, positive and negative market values
of multiple rate contracts with a single counterparty to determine one current credit exposure relative to that counterparty.

It was noted in the Accord that the legal enforceability of certain netting arrangements was unclear in some jurisdictions.
The legal status of netting by novation, however, was determined to be settled and this limited type of netting was
recognized. Netting by novation is accomplished under a written bilateral contract providing that any obligation
to deliver a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency
and value date. The previously existing contracts are extinguished and a new contract for the single net amount, in
effect, legally replaces the amalgamated gross obligations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1993 the Basle Supervisors' Committee proposed a revision to the Basle Accord, endorsed by the G&hyph;10
Governors in July 1994, that permits institutions to net positive and negative market values of rate contracts subject
to a qualifying, legally enforceable, bilateral netting arrangement. Under the revision, institutions with a qualifying
netting arrangement may calculate a single net current exposure for purposes of determining the credit equivalent
amount for the included contracts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the net market value of the contracts included in such a netting arrangement is positive, then that market value
equals the current exposure for the netting contract. If the net market value is zero or negative, then the current
exposure is zero.

The revision to the Accord notes that national supervisors must be satisfied about the legal enforceability of a netting
arrangement under the laws of each jurisdiction relevant to the arrangement. The Accord also states that, if any supervisor
is dissatisfied about enforceability under its own laws, the netting arrangement does not satisfy this condition
and neither counterparty may obtain supervisory benefit.

The Board's Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 20, 1994, the Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a joint proposal to amend their
respective risk-based capital standards (59 FR 26456) in accordance with the Basle Supervisors' Committee's April
1993 proposal.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The joint proposal provided that for capital purposes institutions regulated by the Board and the OCC could net the
positive and negative market values of interest and exchange rate contracts subject to a qualifying, legally enforceable,
bilateral netting contract to calculate one current exposure for that netting contract (sometimes referred to as
the master netting contract).

Corporation (FDIC) issued its netting proposal on July 25, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provided that the net current exposure would be determined by adding together all positive and negative
market values of individual contracts subject to the netting contract. The net current exposure would equal the sum
of the market values if that sum is a positive value, or zero if the sum of the market values is zero or a negative value.
The proposals did not alter the calculation method for potential future exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential future exposure is estimated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract by a credit conversion
factor which is based on the type of contract and the remaining maturity of the contract. Under the Board/OCC proposal,
a potential future exposure amount would be calculated for each individual contract subject to the netting contract.
The individual potential future exposures would then be added together to arrive at one total add-on amount.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, institutions would be able to net for risk-based capital purposes only with a written bilateral
netting contract that creates a single legal obligation covering all included individual rate contracts and does
not contain a walkaway clause.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal required an institution to obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) stating that under the master
netting contract the institution would have a claim to receive, or an obligation to pay, only the net amount of the sum
of the positive and negative market values of included individual contracts if a counterparty failed to perform due
to default, insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances.

A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments
than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter,
even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal indicated that the legal opinion must normally cover: (i) The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty
is chartered, or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty
is involved, the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs the individual contracts
covered by the netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provided that an institution must maintain in its files documentation adequate to support the bilateral
netting contract. Documentation would typically include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, legal opinions
and any related translations. In addition, the proposal required an institution to establish and maintain procedures
to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts would be kept under review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, the Federal Reserve could disqualify any or all contracts from netting treatment for risk-based
capital purposes if the requirements of the proposal were not satisfied. In the event of disqualification, the affected
contracts would be treated as though they were not subject to the master netting contract. The proposal indicated
that outstanding netting by novation arrangements would not be grandfathered, that is, such arrangements would
have to meet all of the proposed requirements for qualifying bilateral netting contracts.

The Board received nineteen public comments on the proposed amendment. Eleven comments were from banking organizations
and five were from industry trade associations and organizations. In addition, there were three comments from law
firms. All commenters supported the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts for risk-based capital
purposes. Several commenters encouraged recognition of such contracts as quickly as possible. Many of the commenters
concurred with one of the principal underlying tenets of the proposal, that is, that legally enforceable bilateral
netting contracts can provide an efficient and desirable means for institutions to reduce or control credit exposure.
A few commenters noted that, in their view, the recognition of bilateral netting contracts would create an incentive
for market participants to use such arrangements and would encourage lawmakers to clarify the legal status of netting
arrangements in their jurisdictions. One commenter noted that the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts
would help keep U.S. banking organizations competitive in global derivatives markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While generally expressing their endorsement for the expanded recognition of bilateral netting contracts, nearly
all commenters offered suggestions or requested clarification regarding details of the proposals. In particular,
the commenters raised issues concerning specifics of the required legal opinions, the treatment of collateral,
and the grandfathering of walkaway clauses and novation agreements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Almost all commenters addressed the proposed requirement that institutions obtain legal opinions concluding that
their bilateral netting contracts would be enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Commenters did not object
to the general requirement that they secure legal opinions, rather they raised a number of questions about the form
and substance of an acceptable opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested clarification as to the specific form of the legal opinion. Commenters wanted to know
if a memorandum of law would satisfy the requirement or if a legal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
opinion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would be required. They questioned whether a memorandum or opinion could be addressed to, or obtained by, an industry
group, and whether a generic opinion or memorandum relating to a standardized netting contract would satisfy the
legal opinion requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that an opinion secured on behalf of the banking industry by an organization should
be sufficient so long as the individual institution's counsel concurs with the opinion and concludes that the opinion
applies directly to the institution's specific netting contract and to the individual contracts subject to it. A
few commenters requested confirmation that legal opinions would not have to follow a predetermined format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters identified two possible interpretations of the proposed language with regard to the scope of
the legal opinions. They asked for clarification as to whether the opinions would be required to discuss only whether
all relevant jurisdictions would recognize the contractual choice of law, or whether they must also discuss the enforceability
of netting in bankruptcy or other instances of default. One commenter suggested deleting the requirement for a choice
of law analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters objected to the proposed requirement that the legal opinion for a multibranch netting contract
(that is, a netting contract between multinational banks that includes contracts with branches of the parties located
in various jurisdictions) address the enforceability of netting under the law of the jurisdiction where each branch
is located. These commenters stated that it should be sufficient for the legal opinion to conclude that netting would
be enforced in the jurisdiction of the counterparty's home office if the master netting contract provides that all
transactions are considered obligations of the home office and the branch jurisdictions recognize that provision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Severability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters expressed concern about the proposed treatment for netting contracts that include contracts
with branches in jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting is unclear. In such circumstances, commenters
asserted, unenforceability or uncertainty in one jurisdiction should not invalidate the entire netting contract
for risk-based capital netting treatment. These commenters contended that contracts with branches of a counterparty
in jurisdictions that recognize netting arrangements should be netted and contracts with branches in jurisdictions
where the enforceability of netting is not supported by legal opinions should, for risk-based capital purposes,
be severed, or removed from the master netting contract and treated as though they were not subject to that contract.
These commenters noted that this treatment should only be available to the extent it is supported by legal opinion.

Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal required a legal opinion to conclude that ``relevant court and administrative authorities would find''
the netting to be effective. Many commenters that discussed this aspect of the proposal expressed concern that this
standard was too high. They suggested, instead, that the opinions be required to conclude that netting ``should''
be effective.

A few commenters requested clarification regarding the proposed requirement that the netting contract must create
a single legal obligation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Collateral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twelve commenters addressed the proposal's specific request for comment on the nature of collateral and the extent
to which collateral might be recognized in conjunction with bilateral netting contracts. All of these commenters
believed collateral should be recognized as a means of reducing credit exposure. A few commenters noted that collateral
arrangements are increasingly being used with derivative transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters stated that for netting contracts that call for the use of collateral, the amount of required collateral
is determined from the net mark-to-market value of the master netting contract. A few commenters added that mark-to-market
collateral often is used in conjunction with a collateral ``add-on'' based on such things as the notional amount of
the underlying contracts, the maturities of the contracts, the credit quality of the counterparty, and volatility
levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters offered their opinions as to how collateral should be recognized for risk-based capital purposes.
Some suggested that the existing method of recognizing collateral for purposes of assigning credit equivalent amounts
to risk categories is applicable to derivative transactions as well. Other commenters expressed the view that collateral
should be recognized when assigning risk weights to the extent it is legally available to cover the total credit exposure
for the bilateral netting contract in the event of default and that this availability should be addressed in the legal
opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters suggested separating the net current exposure and potential future exposure of bilateral
netting contracts for determining collateral coverage and appropriate risk weights. One commenter favored recognizing
collateral for capital purposes by allowing an institution to offset net current exposure by the amount of the collateral
to further reduce the credit equivalent amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters requested clarification that contracts subject to qualifying netting contracts could be eligible
for a zero percent risk weight if the transaction is properly collateralized in accordance with the Board's collateralized
transactions rule.

In December 1992 the Board issued an amendment to its risk-based capital guidelines permitting certain collateralized
transactions to qualify for a zero percent risk weight (57 FR 62180, December 30, 1992). In order to qualify for a zero
percent risk weight, an institution must maintain a positive margin of qualifying collateral at all times. Thus,
the collateral arrangement should provide for immediate liquidation of the claim in the event that a positive margin
of collateral is not maintained. The OCC has issued a similar proposal (58 FR 43822, August 18, 1993).

Walkaway Clauses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters addressed the proposed prohibition against walkaway clauses in contracts qualifying for netting
for risk-based capital purposes. While most of these commenters agreed that, ultimately, walkaway clauses should
be eliminated from master netting contracts, they favored a phase-out period, during which outstanding bilateral
netting contracts containing walkaway clauses could qualify for capital netting treatment. Several commenters
contended that if a defaulter is a net debtor under the contract, the existence of a walkaway clause would not affect
the amount owed to the non-defaulting creditor.

One commenter requested greater detail on the nature and extent of examination review procedures. Two commenters
stated that in some situations obtaining translations might be burdensome. Another commenter suggested assurance
that the Federal Reserve would not disqualify netting contracts in an unreasonable manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately one-half of the commenters expressed concern that the proposal specifically was limited to interest
rate and exchange rate contracts. All of these opposed limiting the range of products that could be included under
qualifying netting contracts. In this regard, one commenter noted that where there is sufficient legal support confirming
the enforceability of cross-product netting, such netting should be recognized for capital purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters used the proposal as an opportunity to discuss the manner in which the add-on for potential future
exposure is calculated. They suggested netting contracts should be recognized not only as a way to reduce the current
exposure to a counterparty, but also the effects of such netting contracts should be taken into account to reduce the
amount of capital organizations must hold against the potential future exposure to the counterparty.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the public comments received and further deliberating the issues involved, the Board is adopting
a final rule recognizing, for capital purposes, qualifying bilateral netting contracts. This final rule is substantially
the same as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Legal Opinions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that institutions obtain a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) concluding that the netting
contract is enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. This requirement is aimed at ensuring there is a substantial
legal basis supporting the legal enforceability of a netting contract before reducing a banking organization's
capital requirement based on that netting contract. A legal opinion, as generally recognized by the legal community
in the United States, can provide such a legal basis. A memorandum of law may be an acceptable alternative as long as
it addresses all of the relevant issues in a credible manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the proposal, the legal opinions may be prepared by either an outside law firm or an institution's in-house
counsel. The salient requirements for an acceptable legal opinion are that it: (i) Addresses all relevant jurisdictions;
and (ii) concludes with a high degree of certainty that in the event of a legal challenge the banking organization's
claim or obligation would be determined by the relevant court or administrative authority to be the net sum of the positive
and negative mark-to-market values of all individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract. The subject
matter and complexity of required legal opinions will vary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To some extent, institutions may use general, standardized opinions to help support the legal enforceability of
their bilateral netting contracts. For example, a banking organization may have obtained a memorandum of law addressing
the enforceability of netting provisions in a particular foreign jurisdiction. This opinion may be used as the basis
for recognizing netting generally in that jurisdiction. However, with regard to an individual master netting contract,
the general opinion would need to be supplemented by an opinion that addresses issues such as the enforceability of
the underlying contracts, choice of law, and severability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Board does not believe that a generic opinion prepared for a trade association with respect to the
effectiveness of netting under the standard form agreement issued by the trade association, by itself, is adequate
to support a netting contract. Banking organizations using such general opinions would need to supplement them with
a review of the terms of the specific netting contract that the institution is executing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Scope. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the scope of the legal opinions, that is, what areas of analysis must be covered, the Board is of the opinion
that legal opinions must address the validity and enforceability of the entire netting contract. The opinion must
conclude that under the applicable state or other jurisdictional law the netting contract is a legal, valid, and binding
contract, enforceable in accordance with its terms, even in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar proceedings.
Opinions provided on the law of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. should include a discussion and conclusion that
netting provisions do not violate the public policy or the law of that jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has further determined that one of the most critical aspects of a qualifying netting contract is the contract's
enforceability in any jurisdiction whose law would likely be applied in an enforcement action, as well as the jurisdiction
where the counterparty's assets reside. In this regard, and in light of the policy in some countries to liquidate branches
of foreign banking organizations independent of the head office, the Board is retaining its proposed requirement
that legal opinions address the netting contract's enforceability under: (i) The law of the jurisdiction in which
the counterparty is chartered, or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of
the counterparty is involved, the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; (ii) the law that governs
the individual contracts subject to the bilateral netting contract; and (iii) the law that governs the netting contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Severability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board recognizes that for some multibranch netting contracts an organization may not be able to obtain a legal
opinion(s) concluding that netting would be enforceable in every jurisdiction where branches covered under the
master netting contract are located. The Board concurs with commenters that in such situations it may be inefficient
to require institutions to renegotiate netting contracts to ensure they cover only those jurisdictions where netting
is clearly enforceable. The Board has determined that, in certain circumstances for capital purposes, banking institutions
may use master bilateral netting contracts that include contracts with branches across all jurisdictions. Banking
institutions should calculate their net current exposure for the contracts in those jurisdictions where netting
clearly is enforceable as supported by legal opinion(s). The remaining contracts subject to the netting contract
should be severed from the netting contract and treated as though they were not subject to the netting contract for
capital and credit purposes. This approach of essentially dividing contracts subject to the netting contact into
two categories_those that clearly may be netted and those that may not_is acceptable provided that the banking organization's
legal opinions conclude that the contracts that do not qualify for netting treatment are legally severable from the
master netting contract and that such severance will not undermine the enforceability of the netting contract for
the remaining qualifying contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conclusions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has retained the proposed language that legal opinions must represent that netting would be enforceable
in all relevant jurisdictions. In response to commenters' assertions that the standard for this type of legal opinion
is too high, the Board notes that use of the word ``would'' in the capital rules does not necessarily mean that the legal
opinions must also use the word ``would'' or that enforceability must be determined to be an absolute certainty. The
intent, rather, is for banking organizations to secure a legal opinion concluding that there is a high degree of certainty
that the netting contract will survive a legal challenge in any applicable jurisdiction. The degree of certainty
should be apparent from the reasoning set out in the opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that the requirement for legal opinions to conclude that netting contracts must create a single legal
obligation applies only to those individual contracts that are covered by, and included under, the netting contract
for capital purposes. As discussed above, a netting contract may include individual contracts that do not qualify
for netting treatment, provided that these individual contracts are legally severable from the contracts to be netted
for capital purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions generally must include all contracts covered by a qualifying netting contract in calculating the current
exposure of that netting contract. In the event a netting contract covers transactions that are normally excluded
from the risk-based ratio calculation_for example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen
calendar days or less or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution
may choose to either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current
exposure, but this choice must be followed consistently.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Collateral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule permits, subject to certain conditions, institutions to take into account qualifying collateral
when assigning the credit equivalent amount of a netting contract to the appropriate risk weight category in accordance
with the procedures and requirements currently set forth in the Board's risk-based capital guidelines. The Board
has added language to the final rule clarifying that collateral must be legally available to cover the credit exposure
of the netting contract in the event of default. For example, the collateral may not be pledged solely against one individual
contract subject to the master netting contract. The legal availability of the collateral must be addressed in the
legal opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Walkaway Clauses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has considered the suggestion made by some commenters of a phase-out period for outstanding contracts with
walkaway clauses. The Board continues to believe that walkaway clauses do not reduce credit risk. Accordingly, the
final rule retains the provision that bilateral netting contracts with walkaway clauses are not eligible for netting
treatment for risk-based capital purposes and does not provide for a phase-out period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Novation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal required all netting contracts, including netting by novation agreements, to be supported by written
legal opinions. The Board does not agree with commenters that a grandfathering period for outstanding novation agreements
is needed. Rather, the Board continues to believe that all netting contracts must be held to the same standards in order
to promote certainty as to the legal enforceability of the contracts and to decrease the risks faced by counterparties
in the event of default. Under the final rule, a netting by novation agreement must meet the requirements for a qualifying
bilateral netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has considered all of the other issues raised by commenters. With regard to documentation, the Board reiterates
that, as with all provisions of risk-based capital, a banking organization must maintain in its files appropriate
documentation to support any particular capital treatment including netting of rate contracts. Appropriate documentation
typically would include a copy of the bilateral netting contract, supporting legal opinions, and any related translations.
The documentation should be available to examiners for their review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board recognizes commenters' concerns that the proposed rule was limited specifically to interest and exchange
rate contracts. The Board notes that both the Basle Accord and the Board's risk-based capital guidelines currently
do not address derivatives contracts other than rate contracts. This final rule does not attempt to go beyond the scope
of the existing risk-based capital framework and applies only to netting contracts encompassing interest rate and
foreign exchange rate contracts. The Board, however, notes that the Basle Supervisors' Committee issued a proposal
for public comment in July 1994 to amend the Basle Accord that explicitly would set forth the risk-based capital treatment
for other types of derivative transactions, such as commodity, precious metal, and equity contracts. In this regard,
the Board issued a similar proposal, based on the Basle Supervisors' Committee proposal, to amend its risk-based
capital guidelines (59 FR 43508, August 24, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until the Basle Accord has been revised and the Board's risk-based capital rules have been amended to encompass commodity,
precious metal, and equity derivative contracts, the Board, rather than automatically disqualifying from capital
netting treatment an entire netting contract that includes non-rate-related transactions, will permit institutions
to apply the following treatment. In determining the current exposure of otherwise qualifying netting contracts
that include non-rate-related contracts, institutions will be permitted to net the positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the included interest and exchange rate contracts, while severing the non-rate-related contracts and
treating them for risk-based capital purposes as individual contracts that are not subject to the master netting
contract. (This treatment is similar to the treatment applied to a netting contract that includes contracts in jurisdictions
where the enforceability of netting is not supported by legal opinion. With non-rate-related contracts, however,
legal opinions on severability are not required.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that the regulatory language with regard to the calculation of potential future exposure remains
essentially the same as that proposed. The Board has clarified an underlying premise of the current exposure method
for calculating credit exposure as set forth in the Basle Accord, that is, the add-on for potential future exposure
must be calculated based on the effective, rather than the apparent, notional principal amount and the notional amount
an institution uses will be subject to examiner review.

The notional amount is, generally, a stated reference amount of money used to calculate payment streams between the
counterparties. In the event that the effect of the notional amount is leveraged or enhanced by the structure of the
transaction, institutions must use the actual, or effective, notional amount when determining potential future
exposure.

Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations
pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108
Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of
any new regulation that imposes additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires
such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the
agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new capital rule imposes certain requirements on depository institutions that wish to net the current exposures
of their rate contracts for purposes of calculating their risk-based capital requirements. For these institutions,
any burden of complying with the requirements of netting under a legally enforceable netting contract and obtaining
the necessary legal opinions should be outweighed by the benefits associated with a lower capital requirement. The
new rule will not affect institutions that do not wish to net for capital purposes. For these reasons, the Board has
determined that an effective date of December 31, 1994 is appropriate, in order to allow banking organizations to
take advantage of netting in their year-end statements, if they so desire. For these same reasons, in accordance with
5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) the Board finds there is good cause not to follow the 30-day notice requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)
and to make the rule effective on December 31, 1994.

Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance-sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral
netting contract in accordance with section III.E.5. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure
(sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit
exposure over the remaining life of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is
positive, then the current exposure is that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative,
then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies
specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value,
is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor. Banks should,
subject to examiner review, use the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation.
The conversion factors are:

d. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for these instruments are contained in Attachment V of
this appendix A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity, and exchange rates are generally
more volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been established for foreign exchange rate contracts
than for interest rate contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. No potential future credit exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are
made based upon two floating rate indices, so-called floating/floating or basis swaps; the credit exposure on these
contracts is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market values.

For interest and exchange rate contracts, sufficiency of collateral or guarantees is determined by the market value
of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees
are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B. of this appendix A. Collateral held against a netting
contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available to support the single legal obligation
created by the netting contract.

a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values
in the determination of a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally
enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of rate contracts is recognized
for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that:

i. The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering
all included individual contracts, with the effect that the bank would have a claim to receive, or obligation to pay,
only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual contracts
in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform
due to any of the following events: Default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. The bank obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge_including
one resulting from default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances_the relevant court and administrative
authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under:

A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments
than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter,
even if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

c. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a bank represents
that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the bank's files and available
for inspection by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may determine that a bank's files are inadequate or that
a netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not be legally enforceable under any one of
the bodies of law described in paragraph 5.a.ii.

. of section III of this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be disqualified from recognition
for risk-based capital purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not subject
to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 d. The credit equivalent amount of rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated
by adding (i) the current exposure of the netting contract, and (ii) the sum of the estimates of the potential future
credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, estimated in accordance with section
III.E.2. of this appendix A.

For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for foreign exchange contracts
and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is
defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts
in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by summing all positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is
positive, then the current exposure of the netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market
values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the netting contract is zero. The Federal Reserve may determine
that a netting contract qualifies for risk-based capital netting treatment even though certain individual contracts
may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that are
not subject to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 f. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for
example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less, or instruments traded
on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution may elect to consistently either include
or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure.

contract is contained in Attachment V of this appendix A.

1. The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is the sum of the current credit exposure of the contract and an estimate
of potential future increases in credit exposure. The current exposure is the positive mark-to-market value of the
contract (or zero if the mark-to-market value is zero or negative). For rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying
bilateral netting contract the current exposure is, generally, the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the contracts included in the netting contract (or zero if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero
or negative). The potential future exposure is calculated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract
by one of the following credit conversion factors, as appropriate:

2. No potential future exposure is calculated for single currency interest rate swaps in which payments are made based
upon two floating indices, that is, so called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts
is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity
of fourteen days or less are excluded. Instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin
are also excluded.

Calculation of credit equivalent amounts. a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet rate contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting
contract in accordance with section III.E.5. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (sometimes
referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and an (ii) estimate of the potential future credit exposure
over the remaining life of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is
positive, then the current exposure is that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative,
then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies
specified in the contract, and should reflect changes in the relevant rates, as well as counterparty credit quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value,
is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factors. Banking
organizations should, subject to examiner review, use the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The conversion factors are:

e. Because exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal upon maturity, and exchange rates are generally
more volatile than interest rates, higher conversion factors have been established for exchange rate contracts
than for interest rate contracts.

 For interest and exchange rate contracts, sufficiency of collateral or guarantees is determined by the market value
of the collateral or the amount of the guarantee in relation to the credit equivalent amount. Collateral and guarantees
are subject to the same provisions noted under section III.B. of this appendix A. Collateral held against a netting
contract is not recognized for capital purposes unless it is legally available to support the single legal obligation
created by the netting contract.

Netting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark to-market values
in the determination of a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally
enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of rate contracts is recognized
for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 i. The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering
all included individual contracts, with the effect that the organization would have a claim to receive, or obligation
to receive or pay, only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual
contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails
to perform due to any of the following events: default, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. The banking organization obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal
challenge_including one resulting from default, bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar circumstances_the relevant
court and administrative authorities would find the banking organization's exposure to be such a net amount under:

A walkaway clause is a provision in a netting contract that permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make lower payments
than it would make otherwise under the contract, or no payment at all, to a defaulter or to the estate of a defaulter even
if the defaulter or the estate of the defaulter is a net creditor under the contract.

c. By netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating its credit equivalent amount, a banking organization
represents that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the organization's
files and available for inspection by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization's
files are inadequate or that a netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not be legally
enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in paragraph 5.a.ii.

. of section III of this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be disqualified from recognition
for risk-based capital purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not subject
to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 d. The credit equivalent amount of rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated
by adding (i) the current exposure of the netting contract, and (ii) the sum of the estimates of the potential future
credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract, estimated in accordance with section
III.E.2. of this appendix A.

For purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for foreign exchange contracts
and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, total notional principal is
defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts
in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. The current exposure of the netting contract is determined by summing all positive and negative mark-to-market
values of the individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is
positive, then the current exposure of the netting contract is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market
values is zero or negative, then the current exposure of the netting contract is zero. The Federal Reserve may determine
that a netting contract qualifies for risk-based capital netting treatment even though certain individual contracts
may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that are
not subject to the netting contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 f. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation_for
example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen calendar days or less, or instruments traded
on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin_an institution may elect to consistently either include
or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure.

1. The credit equivalent amount of a rate contract is the sum of the current credit exposure of the contract and an estimate
of potential future increases in credit exposure. The current exposure is the positive mark-to-market value of the
contract (or zero if the mark-to-market value is zero or negative). For rate contracts that are subject to a qualifying
bilateral netting contract the current exposure is the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values
of the contracts included in the netting contract (or zero if the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative).
The potential future exposure is calculated by multiplying the effective notional amount of a contract by one of the
following credit conversion factors, as appropriate:

upon two floating indices, that is, so called floating/floating or basis swaps. The credit exposure on these contracts
is evaluated solely on the basis of their mark-to-market value. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity
of fourteen days or less are excluded. Instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment of variation margin
are also excluded.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Garrett Turbine Engine Company ATF3 series
turbofan engines, that requires a one-time inspection for cracks of the curvic and bore area of the high pressure turbine
(HPT) rotor assembly disk, and replacement, if necessary, with a serviceable disk. This amendment is prompted by
several reports of cracks discovered during routine inspections of HPT rotor assembly disks. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained failure of the HPT rotor assembly disk.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Garrett Turbine Engine Company Model ATF3&hyph;6 and &hyph;6A turbofan engines was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6603). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection for cracks of the curvic and
bore area of high pressure turbine (HPT) rotor assembly disks listed by serial number in Table 1 of Allied-Signal Aerospace
Company, Garrett Engine Division, Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. ATF3&hyph;A72&hyph;6184, Revision 1, dated
January 11, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) determination of the cost to the public.
The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 75 Garrett Turbine Engine Company Model ATF3&hyph;6 and -6A turbofan engines of the affected
design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 2 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected
by this AD, that it will take approximately 220 work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions, and that the
average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $24,200.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This amendment supersedes telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which superseded Telegraphic
AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 (AD), applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. Telegraphic
AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51 reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks from 40,000
total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. Telegraphic
AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52 currently requires repetitive inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh

R&hyph;R Spey engine models, eliminates the option for repetitive inspections, and further reduces the cyclic life
limits. This amendment is prompted by further investigation into disk bore cracking that was caused by corrosion.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to
corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority of the United Kingdom, notified the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) that an unsafe condition may exist on Rolls-Royce, plc 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(R&hyph;R) Spey series turbofan engines. The CAA advised that they received a report of a three-inch crack extending
radially outward from the bore on a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk installed in a R&hyph;R Spey
Model 506&hyph;14D engine. The crack originated from a corrosion pit that apparently had been present at the disk's
entry into service. Investigation indicated that failure of the engine due to disk burst was imminent. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in a seventh stage HPC disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may
result in an uncontained engine failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This engine model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that airworthiness directive (AD) action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for
operation in the United States. On October 20, 1988, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, which reduced
cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks from 40,000 total part cycles in service (TPC) to 35,000 TPC for the R&hyph;R
Spey Model 506&hyph;14 and &hyph;14D engines. On January 26, 1989, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T89&hyph;02&hyph;52, which supersedes Telegraphic AD T88&hyph;22&hyph;51, and currently requires repetitive
inspections or further reduced cyclic life limits for seventh stage HPC disks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;02&hyph;52
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to increase the AD's effectivity to include additional R&hyph;R
Spey engine models, eliminate the option for repetitive inspections of seventh stage HPC disks, further reduce the
cyclic life limits, and require removing from service disks that exceed the revised cyclic life limits following
the schedule established in this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter concurs with the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, and that it will
not take any additional work hours per engine to accomplish the required actions. Replacement parts, prorated for
the reduced life, will cost approximately $1,718 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,214. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes, that requires modification of the brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steering control unit (BSCU). This amendment is prompted by reports that the BSCU on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these airplanes allowed a 90-degree rotation of the nose gear after landing, which resulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in significant damage to the wheels. The actions specified by this AD are intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent failure of the nose gear tires and wheels and the loss of directional control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane while it is on the ground.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
on April 16, 1993 (58 FR 19787). That action proposed to require modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the brake steering control unit (BSCU) for certain airplanes equipped with twin wheel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
main landing gears (MLG). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Airbus issued Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A320&hyph;32&hyph;1100, Revision 1, dated November 9, 1993, which describes procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the BSCU on certain Model A320 series airplanes equipped with bogie 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MLG's. The modification involves upgrading the currently installed standard 3 BSCU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional software to a new standard 3.1 BSCU, which includes reprogramming of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain software for each system of the BSCU. Accomplishment of the modification will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow activation of the nose wheel steering at main gear touchdown, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and authorization of rudder pedal action that would allow progressive amplitude authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 130 to 40 knots. The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for France, classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
French Airworthiness Directive 92&hyph;117&hyph;025(B)R1, dated August 18, 1993, in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA finds that Model A320 series airplanes equipped with bogie MLG's are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the same unsafe condition that is addressed by this rule. In light of this, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to include these airplanes. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there currently are no Model A320 series airplanes equipped with bogie MLG's on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Register; therefore, no additional U.S. airplanes are affected directly by this AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. The FAA considers that the revision to the applicability of the rule is necessary in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to ensure that the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that these specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate service information for modification of the BSCU on airplanes equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bogie MLG's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of the proposed rule, Airbus also has issued Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A320&hyph;32&hyph;1094, Revision 3, dated June 24, 1993. Revision 3 of the service bulletin is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essentially identical to Revision 2 (which was cited in the proposal as the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of service information), but revises the effectivity listing to include one additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. The FAA has determined that this additional airplane is operated currently by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-U.S. operator under foreign registry; therefore, this airplane is not affected directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this AD action. The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite Revision 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the service bulletin as an additional source of service information for accomplishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the required modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will neither increase the economic burden on any U.S. operator nor increase the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 52 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied by the vendor at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,860, or $55 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B
airplanes, that requires repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the tray stop spindle and backrest spindle
bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard sections, if necessary. This amendment
also requires repair and identification of the modification plate, which would terminate the requirement to inspect
repetitively. This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in the vicinity of the tray stop spindle and
backrest spindle bosses, which could lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats
during aft loading. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the backrest on these seats,
which could inhibit emergency egress.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Saab Model SAAB SF340A and SAAB 340B airplanes, equipped with Flight Equipment and Engineering
Limited Model 121 series seats, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 3, 1994 (59 FR 22771). That action proposed to require repetitive inspections to detect cracking of the tray
stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses on the inboard sections of certain seats; and replacement of the inboard
sections, if necessary. It also proposed to require repair and identification of the modification plate, which would
terminate the requirement to inspect repetitively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the single comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter has no objections to the proposal, but questions the accuracy of the description of the point of failure,
as described in the preamble to the notice. The preamble stated, ``Cracking in this area may weaken the machined component
that attaches the backrest of the seats 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
to the main spars of the airplane
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and may lead to excessive movement and eventual failure of the backrest on these seats during aft loading'' (emphasis
added). The commenter implies that it is not accurate to state that the failure point is where the seat backrests attach
to the main spar of the airplane. The FAA has reconsidered its previous description and concurs that clarification
is warranted. The FAA finds that the following wording comprises a more accurate description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cracking in this area may eventually weaken the seat section such that the spindles attaching the table and seat back
to the seat section may break free during crash loads or normal loads. This condition, if not corrected, could result
in failure of the backrest of these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This clarification of the description of the failure scenario in no way alters the basis for issuance of this AD or the
unsafe condition addressed by it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per workhour to $60 per workhour.
The economic impact information below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 73 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work
hours per seat to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. There are usually
34 seats per airplane. Required parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,840, or $4,080 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration
on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair
remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.

To prevent failure of the backrest on these seats, which could inhibit emergency egress, accomplish the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within 28 days after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the
tray stop spindle and backrest spindle bosses of the inboard section of the seat, in accordance with FEEL Service Bulletin
25&hyph;20&hyph;1287, Revision 3, dated March 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If no cracking is found, or if cracking is found that does not penetrate the shear web, repeat the inspection of that
seat thereafter at intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service until the requirements or paragraph (b) of this
AD are accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If any cracking is found that penetrates the shear web, prior to further flight, replace the inboard section (up
to issue 12), and identify the modification plate with ``25&hyph;20&hyph;1287A,'' in accordance with the service
bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service until the requirements
of paragraph (b) of the AD are accomplished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, repair and identify the modification plate with ``25&hyph;20&hyph;1294,''
in accordance with FEEL Service Bulletin 25&hyph;20&hyph;1294, Revision 1, dated May 1993. Accomplishment of the
actions required by this paragraph constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This action requires inspections to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detect cracking in certain oil coolers, and replacement of cracked coolers with serviceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coolers. The amendment also provides for termination of the inspections by installing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain reworked and re-identified oil coolers. This amendment is prompted by reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracking in the welded seams of certain oil coolers. The actions specified in this AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent loss of engine oil due to cracking in the oil cooler, which may lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a forced shutdown of the engine.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that it has received
reports of cracking in the welded seams of certain engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. Investigation revealed
that these oil coolers were welded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrectly during the manufacturing process. These defective welds have been isolated to oil coolers manufactured
by Normalair-Garrett Limited and having part numbers (P/N) 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000. Such cracking, if
not corrected, could result in loss of engine oil, which may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;23, dated August 26, 1994, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engine oil coolers that are cooled by ram air. This service bulletin also describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for replacement of cracked oil coolers with serviceable oil coolers. The CAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified this service bulletin as mandatory in order to assure the continued airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;79&hyph;24&hyph;10360A, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 4, 1994, which describes procedures for rework and re-identification of oil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coolers having P/N's 8248C000, 8439C000, and 8714C000, that are manufactured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normalair-Garrett Limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued to prevent loss of engine oil that may lead to a forced shutdown of the engine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking in oil coolers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having P/N 8248C000, 8439C000, or 8714C000, and replacement of cracked oil coolers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with serviceable oil coolers. Installation of oil coolers that have been reworked and re-identified terminates
the requirement for repetitive detailed visual inspections. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

Comments Invited
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;199&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Model 747 series airplanes.
This action requires inspections to detect cracking of the surfaces of the outboard strut spring beam, and replacement
of cracked spring beams. It also requires an inspection to detect damage to the structure that is adjacent to the cracked
spring beam, and replacement of any cracked parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of failure of a spring beam
due to cracking that was propagated by fatigue. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of
a spring beam, which could lead to loss of an outboard strut.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA received a report that the spring beam on a Boeing Model 747&hyph;200 series airplane equipped with
Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines was severed (failed) forward of the mid pivot bolt housing
at the outboard spring beam on the number 4 outboard strut. Investigation revealed that cracking initiated at a flaw
(porosity) in the material of the spring beam and propagated due to fatigue. The subject airplane was operated as a
freighter and had accumulated 15,809 total flight cycles on the struts. This airplane was originally delivered with
P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 engines and struts, but was later reconfigured with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines
and struts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Spring beams are used in place of midspar fittings on the outboard struts of all Model 747 series airplanes, except
those equipped with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 engines. (The P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;3 and &hyph;7 engines
have midspar fittings at the outboard strut.) Airplanes equipped with P&amp;W Model JT9D&hyph;70 engines have spring
beams that are made of titanium. All other spring beams are made of steel, which analyses and tests have shown to be more
resistant to fatigue cracking than titanium spring beams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fatigue cracking, if not corrected, could result in failure of a spring beam, which could lead to the loss of an outboard
strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;54A2171, dated October 31, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections
to detect cracking of the upper, lower, and side surfaces of the spring beam, and replacement of cracked spring beams
with new spring beams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spring beam due to fatigue cracking, which could lead to the loss of an outboard strut. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This AD requires repetitive detailed visual inspections to detect cracking of the surfaces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the spring beam from the root of the clevis lugs to the forward journal, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of cracked spring beams with new spring beams. This AD also requires an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the adjacent spring beam and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support fittings of the affected strut, and replacement of any cracked parts with new parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to the repetitive detailed visual inspections, this AD also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for an optional terminating action, which entails removing the spring beam, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishing a fluorescent dye penetrant inspection, and accomplishing a zero-time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhaul of the spring beam, in accordance with Section 54&hyph;00&hyph;01 of the Boeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overhaul Manual, and reinstalling that spring beam. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the address specified under the caption

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All communications received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94&hyph;NM&hyph;207&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is exempting 148 generic types of class I devices from the requirement of premarket
notification, with limitations. For the exempted devices, FDA has determined that manufacturers' submissions
of premarket notifications are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of
such submissions will not advance its public health mission. The exemptions allow the agency to make better use of
its resources and thus better serve the public.

Effective January 6, 1995. Beginning on January 6, 1995, all device manufacturers who have 510(k) submissions pending
FDA review for devices falling within a generic category which is subject to this rule, will receive a letter stating
that the device is exempt from the premarket notification requirements of the act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37378), FDA issued a proposed rule to exempt 164 generic types of class I devices from the requirement
of premarket notification, with limitations. Interested persons were given until October 19, 1994 to comment on
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the comment period, FDA received comments requesting that various devices be added to the list of devices that
the agency was proposing be exempt from the requirement of premarket notification. The agency also received comments
requesting that existing exemptions from the requirement of premarket notification for several devices, when made
of certain materials, be expanded to include all devices within the classification, regardless of material composition.
FDA is considering these comments and will address them in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments requested that certain devices proposed for exemption from premarket notification also be exempted
from the requirements of current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's) and records and reports. FDA has decided
not to grant these additional exemptions at this time. Pursuant to 21 CFR 820.1(d), any person petitioning for an exemption
from any device CGMP requirement is required to follow the procedures set forth in 21 CFR 10.30. Accordingly, the devices
listed in this final rule as exempt from premarket notification continue to be subject to applicable CGMP requirements.
FDA believes that compliance with CGMP's is necessary in order to ensure adequate protection of the public health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments questioned the appropriateness of the proposed exemptions for a small number of the devices. In
addition, FDA is reconsidering the appropriateness or scope of the proposed exemptions for several devices included
in the proposed rule. Therefore, FDA is deferring action on the following 16 devices in order to review these comments
and to reevaluate whether certain of the devices should be exempted from the requirement of premarket notification.

FDA will address these devices in a future issue of the Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received no adverse comments on 148 of the devices that it proposed be exempted from the requirement of premarket
notification. For these 148 devices, FDA has concluded that manufacturers' submissions of premarket notifications
are unnecessary for the protection of the public health and that the agency's review of such submissions will not advance
its public health mission. Thus, FDA is finalizing the exemptions for these 148 devices from premarket notification
procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
IV. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
V. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because this final rule reduces a regulatory burden by exempting manufacturers
of devices subject to the final rule from the requirements of premarket notification, the agency certifies that the
final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal funding is authorized under Subtitle A of Title II of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
(Subtitle A), Public Law 103&hyph;322, for grants to states, and states organized in multi-state compacts, for assistance
to adult and juvenile correctional systems. The program recognizes that states and local jurisdictions have experienced
substantial increases in jail, prison and juvenile confinement populations in recent years, resulting in escalating
costs and serious difficulties in managing overcapacity correctional populations. Because of these constraints,
correctional systems have often been unable to implement new programs, develop alternative confinement strategies,
or open new facilities. This program seeks to provide funds to address the immediate needs of correctional facilities
and programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, the program emphasizes the need to make available both conventional jail and prison space for the confinement
of violent offenders and to ensure that violent offenders remain incarcerated for substantial periods of time through
the implementation of truth in sentencing laws. Accordingly, Subtitle A directs the Attorney General to award grants
to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve correctional facilities, including boot camp facilities
and other alternative correctional facilities that will free secure prison space for the confinement of violent
offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifty percent of the total amount of funds appropriated each year will be allocated for Truth in Sentencing Incentive
Grants and the other 50 percent will be allocated for Violent Offender Incarceration Grants, 85 percent of which is
to be distributed by specified formula with the remaining 15 percent available for discretionary grant awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula amount available to carry out the grant programs for any fiscal year will be allocated to each eligible
state based on Part 1 violent crime data reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for use in the Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR). If such data is unavailable, applicants may also utilize figures as reported in publications by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). (See, e.g., ``Census of State and Local Correctional Facilities, 1990.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute contemplates the availability of $7.9 billion in funding over six years, beginning with $175 million
authorized in fiscal year 1995. It is important to note, however, that Congress appropriated only $24.5 million for
Subtitle A programs for fiscal year 1995. Moreover, the Appropriations Act limits these funds to a discretionary
grant program for the construction of correctional boot camps. Specifically, grant awards in fiscal year 1995 are
to develop, construct, or expand boot camp programs which include coordinated, intensive aftercare services following
release. It is anticipated that program guidelines and information outlining the application process for adult
and juvenile boot camp fiscal year 1995 grant awards will be available in January 1995.

Statement of the Problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local prison populations continue to grow. Moreover, there are a number of states and local jurisdictions
under court order because of overcrowding in their correctional facilities. The majority of jurisdictions operate
above the total rated capacity for their correctional facilities. Those facilities under court order for overcrowding
which have taken steps to control their burgeoning inmate populations tend to operate at or near capacity in order
to remain in compliance with the court orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Correctional systems faced with rising prison populations and court-ordered ceilings have responded in various
ways. Some have implemented population management task forces to ensure that violent criminals are not released
as a result of accommodating nonviolent offenders. Others have simply released offenders when their institutions
reach a certain population level, without significant controls over the security classifications of the inmates.
Still other systems under court order have implemented statutory release programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subtitle A provides for immediate assistance to correctional systems to contend with this growing inmate population
crisis. Of primary importance is the recognition that there must be adequate conventional confinement space for
violent offenders, both adults and juveniles, to serve a substantial portion of their sentences. This program, therefore,
provides grants to assist correctional systems in managing a comprehensive approach which will provide for the confinement
of violent offenders; help address the problems associated with overcapacity in correctional facilities through
the improvement, development, expansion or modification of present facilities and programs; and support comprehensive
programs and treatment that will assist in reducing recidivism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal, State and Local Partnerships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because crime is primarily a state and local issue, the Subtitle A grant program envisions a federal, state, and local
collaboration to address the problems associated with the incarceration and punishment of violent offenders. State
and local government officials were involved in the congressional hearings that guided this legislation, and will
continue to be involved as the Department of Justice moves forward in establishing policy guidance, developing regulations,
and implementing program guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this grant program provides flexibility to states and local governments in utilizing federal funds
to plan, construct, and operate correctional facilities in ways that best meet their needs and in the most cost-effective
manner. Built into the program is the recognition that correctional systems can use grant funds in a variety of ways
to ensure the greatest and most timely impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Subtitle A, corrections systems will have the ability to quickly bring on-line additional bed space in facilities
which, although construction has been completed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not being utilized due to funding constraints. States and local agencies can also activate prison and jail expansion
and juvenile corrections projects that have been planned, but not launched, due to lack of funds. The grant program
further provides for the expansion of alternative correctional options for nonviolent offenders which will free
secure bed space for dangerous offenders to serve their sentences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, corrections systems will have flexibility in using surplus federal property. Beds for violent offenders
can be made available in secure facilities through the conversion of closed military facilities or other appropriate
federal facilities to facilities for housing low-security inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle A also recognizes the benefits of regional prisons, particularly for adjoining localities. The economies
of scale resulting from a multi-state compact prison are particularly beneficial for confining specialized groups
of offenders, such as medical/psychiatric inmates, inmates requiring protective custody, and high security inmates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grant program balances appropriate accountability through various eligibility criteria, the availability
of technical assistance, and the evaluation of programs implemented with these funds, with the flexibility states
and local governments require and deserve based on their individual needs and expertise. Grant eligibility criteria
specifically provide for the involvement of counties and local governments and the sharing of funds with these entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the federal role provides sufficient structure and definition in the eligibility criteria to meet the
program's goals, while allowing for judgment by grant recipients to take into account the states' various unique
situations, criminal and juvenile justice practices, and correctional systems. The program accounts for the different
needs of the states and local entities, and reflects that there is no ``national standard'' approach that will suit
all jurisdictions. The grant monies are available for the range of correctional needs such as system planning and
facility development, as well as the construction, expansion, modification, improvement, and operation of a variety
of correctional facilities.

Violent Juvenile Crime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern also continues nationwide over the escalation in violent juvenile crime. According to the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reports, juvenile arrests for violent offenses increased dramatically over the five-year period from 1988
to 1992_47 percent_while adult violent crime arrests increased 19 percent. The estimated 129,600 Violent Crime
Index arrests of juveniles in 1992 was the highest in our history, with 3,300 arrests for murder, 6,300 for forcible
rape, 45,700 for robbery and 74,400 for aggravated assault. Moreover, during the past few years, there has been a marked
escalation of homicides by juvenile offenders. Teenage homicides have more than doubled since 1984, and juvenile
homicides involving firearms have increased 175 percent since 1983. Of particular importance is that the size of
the current 14&hyph;17 year-old population, which has been responsible for much of the recent youth violence, will
increase by about 20 percent in the next decade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent and Chronic Juvenile Offenders,'' developed by the Department's
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, is the centerpiece of the Department's response to growing
juvenile crime. The Subtitle A grant program is an integral part of the comprehensive strategy's intervention component.
The program is based on the recognition that an effective model for the treatment and rehabilitation of delinquent
offenders must combine accountability and sanctions with increasingly intensive treatment and rehabilitative
efforts at every stage of the continuum.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intervention component calls for establishing a range of graduated sanctions that includes both immediate interventions
and intermediate sanctions, including both nonresidential and residential placements and programming. Boot camps
offer an intermediate sanction for nonviolent juvenile offenders. These programs should be short-term and include
a formal aftercare phase, actively involving the family and the community in supporting and reintegrating the juvenile
into the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the strategy encourages the use of non-residential community-based programs and intensive supervision programs
for many juvenile offenders, it recognizes that the criminal behavior of some serious, violent and chronic offenders
requires the use of secure detention and corrections facilities to protect the community and provide a structured
treatment environment. This grant program will facilitate jurisdictions in meeting the challenge of placing juvenile
offenders in need of confinement in secure facilities.

Grants for Correctional Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subtitle A authorization provides for two different grant programs: (1) Violent Offender Incarceration Grants,
and (2) Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants. Of the total federal funding authorized to Subtitle A grant programs
each year, 50 percent is allocated for each of these two grant initiatives. With the exception of a limited discretionary
grant program, this funding will be distributed to states based on the formula specified in Subtitle A. Although the
statute provides for states and multi-state compacts as the only eligible grant recipients, Subtitle A requires
that states involve counties and other units of local government and share funds received under this program with
them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to receive funding under either of the Subtitle A programs, states must comply with a series of assurances
involving sentencing policies and practices and other guarantees of sound correctional systems to ensure that violent
offenders are sufficiently incapacitated and that the public is protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in the assurances are requirements that the state: (1) Implement sentencing reforms that ensure violent
offenders receive sufficiently severe punishments, (2) recognize the rights and needs of crime victims, and (3)
develop a comprehensive correctional management plan that includes diversion programs, particularly drug diversion
programs, community corrections programs, systems designed to accurately evaluate and classify inmates within
the system, and programs and treatment designed to assist in reducing recidivism, including rehabilitation and
treatment programs and job skills. Emphasis will be placed on a corrections system's ability to plan for and implement
these basic components of a comprehensive and coordinated approach to correctional policy.

Comprehensive Correctional Planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By definition, a comprehensive system involves state and local governments; thus, the development of a comprehensive
plan necessitates a partnership and collaboration among state and local entities. Because the flow of offenders
begins at the local level, both local and state governments play key roles in the punishment of offenders through alternative
sanctions and incarceration in correctional facilities. The input of county and municipal juvenile and criminal
justice officials will be considered essential to creating an effective overall state strategy to meet the goals
of this grant program. Both local and state governments also have a strong interest in any change in the capacity of
any component of the corrections system. The statutory assurances are clear in their intent that states are expected
to share funds with local units of government in support of effective implementation of the comprehensive plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the comprehensive plan development should represent a broad mix of interested and involved organizations
and officials from varying perspectives. Every effort should be made by the state to include mayors, city and county
officials, police departments, sheriffs, judges, prosecutors, community corrections administrators, representatives
from the treatment and education communities and indigent defense, concerned citizens, and victims' advocates,
as well as the juvenile justice system. Applicants should also take an active role in involving state and juvenile
justice administrative agencies and advisory boards. The manner in which criminal and juvenile justice functions
are structured in various states and their relationships with other justice agencies will affect the roles played
in the development of an effective correctional plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comprehensive correctional plan must address how the state has involved local jurisdictions and the plan for
sharing funds with local facilities, truth in sentencing and victims' rights issues, and the continuum of correctional
options required for adult and juvenile offenders. It must meet the overall goal of incarcerating violent offenders,
and must convey the options for nonviolent offenders that will free up traditional bed space to accomplish that goal.

Victims' Rights and Needs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible to receive grants, states must provide assurances that they have implemented policies that provide
for the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims. No specific requirements for complying with this condition
are prescribed by this interim rule in relation to fiscal year 1995 funding because of the need for comprehensive review
of the status of victims' rights measures in state systems. State applications for fiscal year 1995 funding should
include information on measures which are in effect or under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration in the state to protect the rights and interests of crime victims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More definitive guidance will be provided concerning compliance with this condition in a final rule or related guidelines
for funding in fiscal year 1996 and thereafter. Areas that have been identified as implicating important rights and
needs of crime victims include: (1) Providing notice to victims concerning case and offender status, (2) providing
an opportunity for victims to be present at public court proceedings, (3) providing victims the opportunity to be
heard at sentencing and parole hearings, (4) providing for restitution and other compensation to victims, and (5)
establishing administrative mechanisms or other mechanisms to effectuate these rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States that expect to seek funding under this program in fiscal year 1996 or thereafter are encouraged to review the
status of victim rights measures in their systems, particularly with reference to the five areas identified above.
Federal law incorporates significant measures in each of these areas for federal cases. The provisions of federal
law governing these issues may be useful for states as a possible model for reform, if they have not already adopted
similar measures in their own systems. See 42 U.S.C. 10606(b)(3), (7), 10607(c) (notice concerning case and offender
status); 42 U.S.C. 10606(b)(4) (right to be present at public court proceedings); Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, as amended effective December 1, 1994 (right of allocution in sentencing for victims); 18 U.S.C. 3663,
3553(c) (general restitution provisions for federal cases); 42 U.S.C. 10607(a) and (b), 10607(c)(5) (assignment

Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible to receive funding under the Truth in Sentencing Grant Program, in addition to meeting the assurances
listed in Subtitle A, states must also meet certain sentencing requirements. In particular, to qualify for this part
of the grant program, states must have in effect sentencing laws that either provide for violent offenders to (1) serve
not less than 85 percent of their sentences, or (2) meet other requirements that ensure that violent offenders, and
especially repeat violent offenders, remain incarcerated for substantially greater percentages of their imposed
sentences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Justice Programs is aware that the vast majority of states will at present have difficulty in meeting
the condition that violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of the sentence imposed. No specific guidance for complying
with this assurance is prescribed at this time both because funding for this program is not available in FY '95, and
also because of the need for further review of state compliance issues. Moreover, we are particularly interested
in comments from the field on compliance issues and on the definition of ``violent offender'' for purposes of truth
in sentencing grant awards.

FY 1995 Correctional Boot Camp Initiative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of funds each year is, of course, limited by the appropriations process. In fiscal year 1995, Congress
has allocated $24.5 million to Subtitle A grant programs and has imposed additional limitations on the uses of these
grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with congressional intent, grant awards in fiscal year 1995 will be for construction-related costs of
correctional boot camps and will be allocated through the discretionary grant component of the Violent Offender
Incarceration Grant Program. Construction-related costs are broadly interpreted to include costs associated
with both the planning and development of the facility. OJP is expressly precluded, however, from funding operating
expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, grant funds can be used to plan, develop, construct, or expand adult and juvenile boot camp programs
which must include coordinated, intensive aftercare services for inmates following release. Pursuant to the requirements
specified in Subtitle A, boot camps are correctional programs of no longer than six-months incarceration and must:
(1) Exclude offenders who have at any time been convicted of a violent felony or similarly adjudicated juveniles,
(2) adhere to a regimented schedule, (3) provide for inmate participation in education, job training and substance
abuse counseling or treatment, and (4) coordinate intensive aftercare services with the services provided during
the period of confinement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program emphasis in fiscal year 1995 will be on the construction, renovation and expansion of correctional boot
camp facilities that will free conventional prison, jail and juvenile correctional space for the confinement of
violent offenders so they can serve a substantial amount of their imposed sentences. To receive funds, correctional
systems will have to demonstrate, through a comprehensive correctional plan and prisoner screening and security
classification system, that (1) there is a need for additional secure confinement space for violent offenders, and
(2) this need will be met through the construction of a boot camp facility that provides housing otherwise unavailable
for nonviolent offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to juvenile facilities, priority will be given to juvenile boot camps that are designed to prevent juvenile
offenders at risk from becoming violent offenders. This desired outcome will most likely be accomplished if the jurisdiction
engages in efforts that maximize the likelihood that juvenile boot camp participants would otherwise be incarcerated
in traditional secure facilities (e.g., participation limited to those youths who have been adjudicated delinquents
and who have been sentenced to the juvenile state correctional agency). Among this population, juvenile offenders
whose escalating patterns of delinquent behavior indicate that an authoritative boot camp intervention is likely
to suppress or abate emerging tendencies towards chronic or violent delinquent behavior should be considered prime
candidates for boot camp participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible to receive grants for correctional boot camp construction, states must meet the eligibility criteria
outlined for the Violent Offender Incarceration Grant Program, including the assurances specified in Section 20101(b)
of Subtitle A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detailed program guidelines and application material for the fiscal year 1995 correctional boot camp initiative
will be available in January 1995.

Technical Assistance and Training/Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the intent of Congress to assist states in meeting these assurances, the Department proposes to designate
up to 10 percent of the funds available in this program to provide technical assistance and training to states that
presently do not meet the required general assurances or want to expand and improve on current efforts in these areas.
Specifically, the Department will provide training and assistance to states with the comprehensive corrections
planning process, the development of truth in sentencing statutes, and in otherwise moving toward compliance with
the required conditions. States which meet the general assurances in fiscal year 1995, or are working toward compliance,
will be in a better position to receive grant monies under these programs over the next several years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it is the intent of the Department that selected federal initiatives under the new anti-crime law be evaluated.
To accomplish this goal, a portion of the overall funds authorized under this Subtitle will be set aside for purposes
of implementing a national evaluation strategy. Recipients of funds must agree to cooperate with federally-sponsored
evaluations of their projects and to conduct evaluations as required by the national evaluation strategy. In addition,
recipients of program funds will be required to conduct a local assessment and report on program implementation.

of crime victims'' [&sect;91.3(b)(2)]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) How a state can demonstrate that, as a result of the funds received under this section, secure space will be made
available for the confinement of violent offenders [&sect;91.3(b)(3)]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) How to ensure that states have met the condition to involve and share funds received with counties and other units
of local government [&sect;91.3(b)(5)]; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) How a state can demonstrate compliance with the condition for receiving Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants,
i.e., ``persons convicted of violent crimes serve not less than 85% of the sentence imposed'' [&sect;91.4(b)].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principles
of Regulation. This rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory
Planning and Review, and accordingly this rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) has reviewed this regulation and by approving it certifies that this regulation will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No information collection requirements are contained in this rule. Any information collection requirements contained
in future application notices for programs authorized by this rule will be reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), as is required by the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 91 U.S.C. 3504(h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is being published as an interim final rule, without prior publication of notice and comment, and
is made effective immediately, for good cause as explained below. Under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), matters relating to grants
are exempted from notice and comment requirements. Moreover, in this case, advance notice and comment would be impractical
and contrary to the public interest. Title II, Subtitle A of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994
requires the publication of regulations implementing the grant program within 90 days of enactment of the Act.

In order to satisfy congressional requirements and intentions of expeditious implementation, these regulations
are effective immediately so that eligible states may apply for the boot camp discretionary program. Publishing
a notice of proposed rulemaking and awaiting receipt of comments would significantly delay the implementation of
the FY '95 boot camp grant program. Such delay would be contrary to the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest and would contradict the congressional intent to provide immediate grant assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although OJP will proceed expeditiously with regard to the promulgation of guidelines for the fiscal year 1995 boot
camp program, we are very interested in receiving public comment on the overall program and will consider all comments
in preparing the final rule.

truth in sentencing laws. No specific requirements for complying with this condition are prescribed by this interim
rule for fiscal 1995 funding because of the need for further review of the status of truth in sentencing laws and the
impact and needs requirements relating to reform in state systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Assurances that the state(s) have implemented or will implement policies that provide for the recognition of
the rights and needs of crime victims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are not required to adopt any specific set of victims rights measures for compliance, but the adoption by a state
of measures which are comparable to or exceed those applied in federal proceedings will be deemed sufficient compliance
for eligibility for funding. If the state has not adopted victims rights measures which are comparable to or exceed
federal law, the adequacy of compliance will be determined on a case-by-case basis. States will be afforded a reasonable
amount of time to achieve compliance. States may comply with this condition by providing recognition of the rights
and needs of crime victims in the following areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (i) providing notice to victims concerning case and offender status; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (ii) providing an opportunity for victims to be present at public court proceedings in their cases; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iii) providing victims the opportunity to be heard at sentencing and parole hearings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (iv) providing for restitution to victims; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (v) establishing administrative or other mechanisms to effectuate these rights.

correctional facilities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ensure that secure space is available for the confinement of violent offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) Assurances that the state(s) has a comprehensive correctional plan in accordance with the definition elements

 (5) Assurances that the state(s) has involved counties and other units of local government, when appropriate, in
the construction, development, expansion, modification, operation or improvement of correctional facilities
designed to ensure the incarceration of violent offenders and that the state(s) will share funds received with counties
and other units of local government, taking into account the burden placed on these units of government when they are
required to confine sentenced prisoners because of overcrowding in state prison facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (6) Assurances that funds received under this section will be used to supplement, not supplant, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 other federal, state, and local funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (7) Assurances that the state(s) has implemented, or will implement within 18 months after the date of the enactment

status of inmates and to ensure that incarcerated veterans receive the veterans benefits to which they are entitled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (8) Assurances that correctional facilities will be made accessible to persons conducting investigations under
the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (9) If applicable, documentation of the multi-state compact agreement that specifies the construction, development,
expansion, modification, operation, or improvement of correctional facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) States, and states organized as multi-state compacts, which can demonstrate affirmative responses to the assurances
outlined above will be eligible to receive funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each state application for such funds must be accompanied by a comprehensive correctional plan. The plan shall
be developed in consultation with representatives of appropriate state and local units of government, shall include
both the adult and juvenile correctional systems, and shall provide an assessment of the state and local correctional
needs, and a long-range implementation strategy for addressing those needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Local units of government, i.e., any city, county, town, township, borough, parish, village or other general
purpose subdivision of a state, or Indian tribe which performs law enforcement functions as determined by the secretary
of the Interior, are in turn eligible to receive subgrants from a participating state(s). Such subgrants shall be
made for the purpose(s) of carrying out the implementation strategy, consistent with state(s) comprehensive correctional
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In awarding grants, consideration shall be given to the special burden placed on states which incarcerate a substantial
number of inmates who are in the United States illegally. States will not be required to submit additional information
on numbers of criminal aliens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) are currently working
together to implement the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) to assist the states with the costs of incarcerating
criminal aliens. The Office of Justice Programs will coordinate with the SCAAP program to obtain the relevant information.

General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Scope of Boot Camp Program. Funding is appropriated in fiscal year 1995 to provide grants to states and multi-state
compacts to plan, develop, construct and expand correctional boot camps for adults and juveniles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Adult and juvenile boot camps, referred to as ``correctional boot camps,'' are programs that ``provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 structured environment for delivering non-traditional corrections programs to criminal offenders.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) With respect to this program, the mandates of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. Sec.
5601 et seq.) shall apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Funding is available for both adult and juvenile boot camps. To be eligible for the funding of boot camps, states
must comply with the general assurances in &sect;91.3(b) or demonstrate steps taken toward compliance. While the
majority of assurances are applicable to the adult correctional system, those states applying for grants for juvenile
boot camps must include the juvenile system in the state comprehensive correctional plan and demonstrate how construction
of the boot camp will make secure space available to house violent juvenile offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of the FY '95 boot camp program, a ``violent felony'' means any crime punishable by imprisonment for
a term exceeding one year, or an act of juvenile delinquency that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term
if committed by an adult, that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) involves the use or attempted use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon against another person, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) results in death or serious bodily injury to another person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) States must document that the boot camp program does not involve more than six-months confinement (not including
confinement prior to assignment to the boot camp) and includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) assignment for participation in the program, in conformity with state law, by prisoners other than prisoners
who have been convicted at any time of a violent felony; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) adherence by inmates to a highly regimented schedule that involves strict discipline, physical training and
work; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) participation by inmates in appropriate education, job training, and substance abuse counseling or treatment;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) post-incarceration aftercare services for participants that are coordinated with the program carried out
during the period of imprisonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) States must provide assurances that boot camp construction will free up secure institutional bed space for violent
offenders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Recipients will be required to cooperate with a national evaluation team throughout the planning and implementation
process. Recipients are also strongly encouraged to provide for an independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of the funded program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Jurisdictions are strongly encouraged to engage in systematic planning activities and to develop and evaluate
boot camps as part of a comprehensive and integrated correctional plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Limitation on funds. Grant funds cannot be used for operating costs. States will be required to show how operating
expenses will be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Matching Requirement. The federal share of a grant received may not exceed 75 percent of the costs of the proposed
boot camp program described in the appoved application. The matching requirement can only be met through a hard cash
match, and must be satisfied by the end of the project period; facility operating expenses may not be used to meet the
match requirement for the construction project supported. Match may be made through grantee contribution of construction-related
costs. A certification to that effect will be required of each recipient of grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Innovative Boot Camp Programs. Jurisdictions are encouraged to explore the development of ``innovative'' boot
camp programs which incorporate principles based on the accumulation of research and practical experience, and
reflect sound and effective correctional practice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a Notice of Proposed Rule Making has not been published for this regulation and good
cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. The original application to
hold this event was not submitted until October 25, 1994 to Coast Guard Group Baltimore. Because of the late original
submission date and the additional changes there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance
of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Publishing an NPRM and delaying its effective date would be
contrary to the public interest since immediate action is needed to prevent hazards to the boating community.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Baltimore Office of Promotion requested a safety zone for the Baltimore Inner Harbor fireworks display to take
place December 31, 1994/January 1, 1995 with an alternate date of January 1, 1995. Because of the way the fireworks
display will be set up, the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore has determined that two separate safety zones
will be necessary to protect the public and control spectator craft during this event.

Discussion of Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Baltimore is establishing safety zones around two fireworks barges that will
be anchored in the Inner Harbor, Baltimore, Maryland. One barge (Barge A) will be anchored in the middle of the Inner
Harbor Basin, 250 yards off of the west sea wall and the second barge (Barge B) will be anchored approximately 400 yards
west of the West Channel Turning Basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety Zone (A) will be around barge A and will encompass all waters of the Inner Harbor that lie within a circle with
a radius of 200 feet, with the center of the circle being the fireworks barge A. Safety Zone (B) will be around barge B,
and will encompass all waters of the Inner Harbor that lie within a circle with a radius of 840 feet, with the center of
the circle being fireworks barge B.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spectators that wish to watch the fireworks display aboard their vessels may anchor outside of the safety zones, but
they may not anchor in or block a navigable channel. Patrol craft will be on hand to assist the boating public and ensure
safety of life and property during the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Inner Harbor will not be closed for an extended period during these safety zones, vessel traffic should not
be severely disrupted.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by
the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures
of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation will only be in effect for two hours, therefore, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this rule to be
minimal. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.C. of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, and actions to protect public safety have been determined to be categorically excluded from
further environmental documentation.

The Coast Guard is establishing a moving safety zone for the departure of the Deck Barge Isle Del Sol and the Escorting
Tugs on the Savannah River from Marcona Ocean Industries Dock, Fort Jackson continuing throughout its transit until
it is east of the Colreg Demarcation Line. The zone will consist of an area within a 50 yard radius around the tugs and
deck barge during its transit in the Savannah River. The Captain of the Port has restricted vessel operations in this
safety zone. No persons or vessels will be allowed to enter or operate within this zone, except as may be authorized
by the Captain of the Port, Savannah, Georgia. This regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1231, as set out in the

and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory
policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The safety zone will be in effect for a total of 8 hours between November
21, 1994 and December 19, 1994. The specific times are as published in Coast Guard District Seven local notice to mariners.

Since the impact of this proposal is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that, if adopted, it will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Pub. L 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304, eliminated the Copyright
Royalty Tribunal (CRT) and replaced it with a system of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
ad hoc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs) administered by the Librarian of Congress (Librarian) and the Copyright
Office (Office). The CARPs adjust royalty rates and distribute royalties collected under the various compulsory
licenses and statutory obligations of the Copyright Act. The CRT Reform Act, which was effective immediately upon
enactment, directed the Librarian and the Office to adopt the rules and regulations of the CRT found in chapter 3 of
37 CFR, 17 U.S.C. 802(d), and provided that the CRT's regulations were to remain in effect until the Librarian adopts
``supplemental or superseding regulations.'' The Office adopted the CRT's rules and regulations on an interim basis
on December 22, 1993, and notified the public that it intended to begin a rulemaking proceeding to revise and update
those rules. 58 FR 67690 (1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office began the rulemaking proceeding with publication of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on January
18, 1994. 59 FR 2550 (1994). The NPRM contained substantial revisions required by the dual structure of the royalty
rate adjustment and distribution system created by the CRT Reform Act. Since the CRT's rules were designed for a single
administrative body, the Office proposed extensive changes to accommodate the division of authority between the
Librarian and the Copyright Office on the one hand, and the CARPs on the other. In addition to inviting written public
comment, the Copyright Office invited interested parties to a public meeting to discuss the proposed regulations.
More than 50 individuals attended the February 1, 1994, meeting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the concerns the parties expressed at the February public meeting, and thoroughly reviewing the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for immediate adoption of a regulatory framework was underscored by the imminence of a royalty distribution
of money collected under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 for digital audio recording technology (DART). Section
1007(b), 17 U.S.C., requires determination of a DART controversy and commencement of arbitration proceedings on
March 30 of each year for the prior year's royalty collections. The 1992 DART distribution proceeding was begun by
the Copyright Royalty Tribunal but was suspended when the Tribunal was abolished, and therefore needed to be started
anew. The 1993 DART distribution was begun by the Copyright Office under the new authority conferred by the CRT Reform
Act, and on March 1, 1994, the Office published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 asking the claimants to the 1992 and 1993 DART royalties to comment as to the existence of any controversies in the royalty
funds. 59 FR 9773 (1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anticipating a consolidated DART distribution proceeding for the 1992 and 1993 calendar years, the Copyright Office
postponed the date for determination of DART controversies from March 30, 1994, to June 30, 1994, in order to permit
adequate time for the adoption of regulations governing a CARP proceeding. On May 9, 1994, the Office adopted the Interim
Regulations with the intention that they would govern any DART controversies and proceedings beginning June 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office created a new subdivision of the regulations devoted entirely to the operation and procedures of the CARPs.
We removed parts 301 through 311 of chapter III of 37 CFR and created subchapters A and B of chapter II. Subchapter A comprises
the Copyright Office rules and procedures, consisting of parts 201&hyph;211, and remains unchanged. New subchapter
B, created by the Interim Regulations, comprises parts 251&hyph;259, and prescribes the rules and procedures of
the CARPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 251, the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Rules of Procedure, consists of regulations governing the organization
of the CARPs, access to CARP meetings and records, rules governing the conduct and course of proceedings, and procedures
applicable to rate adjustments and distributions. Part 251 also includes extensive rules of conduct for arbitrators,
as well as appropriate ethical and financial standards. We did not propose any specific rules of conduct in the NPRM,
but did reserve a subpart for such rules and solicited comment from the interested parties on the issue. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 252 contains revised rules for the filing of claims to cable royalties, modeled after the system used by the CRT
for the filing of DART royalty claims. Parts 253 to 256_Use of Certain Copyrighted Works in Connection With Noncommercial
Educational Broadcasting; Adjustment of Royalty Rate for Coin-Operated Phonorecord Players; and Adjustment of
Royalty Payable Under Compulsory License for Making and Distributing Phonorecords_is virtually identical to the
former CRT's rules, with only some minor technical changes. Like part 252, part 257_Filing of Claims to Satellite
Carrier Royalty Fees_is modeled after the royalty claim procedures used by the CRT for DART. Finally, parts 258 and
259_Adjustment of Royalty Fee for Secondary Transmissions by Satellite Carriers and Filing of Claims to Digital
Audio Recording Devices and Media Royalty Payments_contains only minor variations from the former CRT's rules.
Since the CRT Reform Act eliminated the jukebox compulsory license and replaced it with a new provision for negotiated
licenses (formerly section 116A of the Copyright Act, as amended by the CRT Reform Act), the Copyright Office dropped
the regulations governing the filing of jukebox royalty claims (formerly 37 CFR part 305). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to soliciting general comments on the Interim Regulations, the Copyright Office also posed a number of
questions to focus the commentators' attention on specific issues and to encourage the parties to offer their solutions.
The questions ranged from whether certain types of DART proceedings were subject to CARP jurisdiction, 59 FR 23967
(1994), to asking for comment on ten hypothetical scenarios designed to test the parameters of the conduct rules.

II. Suspension of DART Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the Office adopted the Interim Regulations to establish a regulatory framework in time for the
start of DART distribution. The Office postponed the date for determination of controversies to the 1992/93 DART
royalty pools from March 30, 1994, to June 30, 1994, to prepare for the possibility of convening a CARP for DART distribution.
We published a request for comment on the existence of a controversy for the 1992/93 funds, adopted the Interim Regulations,
established a procedural schedule for the filing of comments and motions leading up to a convocation of a CARP, and
published the arbitrator list all before June 30. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 9773 (1994) (Request for comments as to existence of controversy and consolidation of 1992 and 1993 funds); 59
FR 23964 (1994) (Interim Regulations); 59 FR 25506 (1994) (Schedule of procedural dates); 59 FR 24486 (1994) (Arbitrator
list). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Office's request for comments as to the existence of controversies, the Office received a motion,
supported by a majority of the 1992/93 DART claimants, requesting that the 1992/93 DART royalty distribution be consolidated
with the 1994 DART distribution. The movants argued that although they anticipated the existence of controversies,
the amount of royalties in the 1992 and 1993 funds was insufficient to justify the cost of a CARP proceeding. They therefore
requested that the Office suspend all procedural dates and defer all consideration of DART distributions until 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 13, 1994, the Librarian of Congress granted the claimants' motion for suspension of the 1992/1993 DART distribution
proceeding and consolidation of that proceeding with the 1994 DART distribution. 59 FR 35762 (1994). The result of
the Librarian's action is that the first DART distribution proceeding will begin no sooner than March 30, 1995. The
Librarian also authorized distribution of the 1992 and 1993 Nonfeatured Musicians and Nonfeatured Vocalists DART
subfunds_two subfunds not subject to CARP proceedings_and scheduled a public meeting for September 27, 1994, to
discuss what would constitute the best evidence for distribution of the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works
Fund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the suspension of DART until 1995, the first proceeding conducted by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel will
likely be distribution of the 1990 and 1991 cable royalties. The claimant groups to 1990/1991 cable royalties have
informed the Copyright Office that they wish to begin proceedings in accordance with final, not interim, regulations.
The Office has already received written comments on the Interim Regulations; therefore, the Copyright Office is
adopting Final Regulations that will govern all rate adjustments and distributions of royalties prescribed by the
CRT Reform Act.

It is important to note that while today's Final Regulations replace the rules contained in the Interim Regulations,
there are several policy determinations and decisions discussed in the preambles to the Interim Regulations and
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which remain in effect. For example, the Office will continue to consider proceedings
pending before the CRT at the time of its elimination as null and void and without binding effect.

III. Joint Claims

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commentators had extensive comments about the interim rule governing the filing of joint royalty claims. Sections
252.3(4) and 257.3(4) require claimants filing a joint claim to cable and satellite carrier compulsory license royalties,
respectively, to identify at least one secondary transmission containing a claimant's copyrighted works for each
claimant listed in the joint claim. See 59 FR 23992, 23994 (1994). Performing rights societies were exempted from
this requirement by &sect;252.3(a)(4) and &sect;257.3(a)(4). Because these sections generated much controversy,
and because some of the commentators filed a motion requesting that the Office reconsider this part of the regulations,
we find that the issue deserves reconsideration and resolution separate from the general discussion of amendment
to the Interim Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former CRT's rules and regulations governing the filing of claims of the CRT, which we adopted on an interim basis
in December 1993, are brief. Section 302.7(a) of the CRT's old rules simply permitted the filing of joint claims for
cable royalties, but provided little else:

For purposes of this clause claimants may file claims jointly or as a single claim. Such filing shall include such information
as the Copyright Royalty Tribunal may require. A joint claim shall include a concise statement of the authorization
for the filing of the joint claim. A performing rights society shall not be required to obtain from its members or affiliates
separate authorizations, apart from their standard agreements, for purposes of this filing and fee distribution.

37 CFR 302.7(a) (1993). To the Copyright Office's knowledge, the Tribunal never adopted or prescribed any additional
requirements for the filing of joint claims, nor was there any guidance on what information should be included in a
claim. Section 309 of the Tribunal's rules, governing the filing of claims to satellite carrier royalties, was even
more concise with respect to the requirements for filing joint claims, stating simply that ``[c]laimants may file
jointly or as a single claim,'' and providing the same exemption for performing rights societies regarding authorizations.

Our NPRM proposed significant revisions to the Tribunal's rules regarding the filing of both cable and satellite
carrier royalty claims. 59 FR 2556, 2557 (1994). The purpose of the proposed revision was to ``implement a procedural
system similar to that adopted by the Tribunal for the filing of digital audio claims.''

at 2566 (cable), 2567 (satellite). Performing rights societies would continue to enjoy an exemption from obtaining
separate authorizations from each of their members for filing a joint claim. For claimants initially filing an individual
claim and later negotiating a joint claim with other claimants, the proposed rules required that either the joint
or individual claimant notify the Copyright Office of the change within 14 days of making the agreement to enter into
a joint claim.

 No mention was made as to whether each joint claimant was required to identify at least one secondary transmission

The Office's proposed changes to the requirements for filing cable and satellite carrier royalty claims elicited
little comment. Only PBS asked for clarification of the requirement for identifying a secondary transmission for
a joint claim; it asked what it took to satisfy the requirement_a statement that merely identified at least one secondary
transmission for at least one of the claimants included within the joint claim, or a statement identifying at least
one secondary transmission for each claimant to the joint claim. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 23979 (1994) (comments of PBS at 2). In discussing PBS' comment in the Interim Regulations, we acknowledged that
the NPRM ``muddie[d] the waters'' for the filing of cable and satellite carrier claims, and the Interim Regulations
deleted the proposed requirement for joint claimants providing a list identifying each claimant to the joint claim.
Id. In so doing, we stated our belief that the former Tribunal's regulations required that a joint claim identify at
least one secondary transmission for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
joint claimant, and found support for such requirement in the Copyright Act:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We are troubled, however, by changing what had been a longstanding requirement at the Tribunal for obliging all claimants
to identify at least one secondary transmission of their copyrighted works. While such requirement does undoubtedly
add to the time and expense burdens of joint claimants such as PBS, it is not without purpose. The law states plainly
that cable compulsory license royalties are only to be distributed to ``copyright owners who claim that their works
were the subject of secondary transmissions by cable systems during the relevant semiannual period.'' 17 U.S.C.
111(d)(3). To support such a claim, each claimant may reasonably be asked to identify at least one secondary transmission
of his or her work, thus permitting the Copyright Office to screen the claims and dismiss any claimants who are clearly
not eligible for royalty fees. The requirement will also help to reduce time spent by a CARP determining which claimants
have a valid claim: if only one secondary transmission is identified for one of the joint claimants, then it could not
readily be determined if the other claimants were even eligible for cable royalties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to end this confusion we are deleting subsection (e) with its requirement that joint claimants submit
a list identifying all the claimants. Instead, we are amending subsection (a)(4) to require that each claimant to
a joint claim, other than a joint claim filed by a performing rights society on behalf of its members or affiliates,
must identify at least one secondary transmission of his or her works.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commentators protested the Office's decision. PBS/NPR, the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball (Baseball),
RIAA, NAB and Program Suppliers submitted comments devoted solely to the filing requirements for joint claims, with
Program Suppliers asking that reconsideration of the joint claims interim regulations be severed from the instant
proceeding for immediate disposition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Suppliers, comments at 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commentators offered essentially four arguments against the Office's decision: (1) to require each joint claimant
to identify a secondary transmission containing its work serves no valid purpose; (2) it creates undue expense; (3)
the Copyright Office is erroneous in believing that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal required each joint claimant
to identify a secondary transmission; and (4) it is unfair and inappropriate to afford performing rights societies
an exemption and not others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, PBS/NPR argued that ``no substantive purpose is served by the requirement for separate identifications of
secondary transmissions as to each party included within the joint claim; this is simply a jurisdictional prerequisite
that will not determine the distribution of royalties.'' PBS/NPR, comments at 2. Program Suppliers concurred with
this view and criticized the Office's expressed concern that individual program information is needed to assist
it and the CARPs to identify claims that should be dismissed: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he Office's suggestion that such information is needed so it could screen hundreds of yearly filings to determine
eligibility, seems a particularly inefficient use of its resources. *&blank;*&blank;* Furthermore, it is unclear
what action, if any, the Office could take regarding eligibility problems related to an individual claimant within
a joint claim. Even if the Office finds that one claimant is ineligible to receive royalties, we would assume that the
joint claim would still remain a valid claim. Whether and to what extent the share awarded to the joint claimants should
be reduced by the ineligibility of one member of the group are questions for a panel based on the record evidence. Indeed,
such questions are incapable of answers at the filing stage.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Suppliers, comments at 3&hyph;4 (footnote omitted). Program Suppliers and Baseball recommended that the
Office should refrain from any examination or ``screening'' of claims as a regular practice, and leave such activities
and eligibility issues to the claimants to raise through motions either to the Librarian or the CARPs. Program Suppliers,
comments at 4; Baseball, comments at 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, RIAA asserted that the requirement for each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission is unduly
expensive and burdensome. Organizations like RIAA, that represent many claimants, would be forced to contact all
of their members and track down a secondary transmission for each one. The problem is compounded by the time lag between
most secondary transmissions and the time period for filings of claims. RIAA, comments at 2&hyph;3. PBS submits that
it devotes roughly 300 hours annually to the task of identifying secondary transmissions for its member stations.
PBS/NPR, comments at 2. These commentators submitted that elimination of the identification requirement for all
joint claimants would dramatically reduce their expense and workload. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, all of the commentators argued that the Copyright Office erred in believing that the Copyright Royalty Tribunal
required each joint claimant to identify a secondary transmission. Apparently, while a reading of the CRT's rules
indicated there may be such a requirement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
footnote 15, 59 FR 23979 (1994), in actual practice the Tribunal allowed joint claimants to submit only one secondary
transmission of a copyrighted work belonging to one of the joint claimants as establishing a basis for a claim for all
of the joint claimants. Baseball and RIAA submitted several examples of such filings. Baseball, comments at appendix;
RIAA, comments at appendix. They asserted that the CRT interpreted its rules to apply the requirement of identification
of at least one secondary transmission to apply equally to individual claims as well as joint claims, meaning that
identification of a least one secondary transmission of one joint claimant was satisfactory to establish a basis
for the entire joint claim. PBS/NPR, comments at 4&hyph;5. They therefore submitted that the Copyright Office erroneously
interpreted CRT practice and should alter its regulations to conform with CRT precedent. PBS/NPR comments at 6; Program
Suppliers, comments at 5; RIAA, comments at 6; Baseball, comments at 5; NAB, comments at 1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, Baseball, PBS/NPR, and RIAA objected to the exemption granted performing rights societies from the Interim
Regulations' requirement of identifying at least one secondary transmission for each joint claimant. Baseball
stated that it ``is firmly of the view that it should not be treated less favorably than the performing rights societies,''
noting that the Interim Regulations gave no reason why performing rights societies should enjoy privileged status.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PBS/NPR, comments at 5. RIAA urged that, if the Copyright Office insists on continuing to require each joint claimant
to identify a secondary transmission, it should broaden the definition of a performing rights society ``to include
not only traditional performing rights societies, but also those joint claimants such as RIAA who, with respect to
the royalties distributed to its members under sections 111 and 119, essentially perform the same functions of `performing
rights societies.''' RIAA, comments at 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to seeking relief from &sect;&sect;252.3(a)(4) and 257.3(a)(4), several commentators urged the Copyright
Office to reconsider other requirements for the filing of cable and satellite carrier royalty claims. Baseball and
the RIAA urged the Copyright Office to eliminate entirely the requirement of identifying a secondary transmission
to establish a basis for a cable or satellite carrier royalty claim. Baseball, comments at 5&hyph;7; RIAA, comments
at 3, 6. Baseball noted several instances where the CRT refused to dismiss a claim for failure to identify a secondary
transmission, and suggested this demonstrates that ``the secondary transmission identification requirement
did nothing more than unnecessarily increase the costs of claimants.'' Baseball, comments at 6. NAB, however, strongly
opposed Baseball's recommendation, asserting that there is no compelling reason to change the requirement and that
elimination of identification of a secondary transmission would be violative of section 111(d)(3) of the Copyright
Act, which authorizes distribution of royalties only to copyright owners whose works were retransmitted on a distant
signal. NAB, comments at 2&hyph;3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Baseball took the ``hands off'' approach one step further by urging the Copyright Office to refrain from making any
substantive review of royalty claims. Baseball, comments at 6&hyph;7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAB, comments at 2; Copyright Owners, reply comments at 9. Baseball argued that ``[r]outine Copyright Office review
of all claims needlessly increases the costs of all copyright owners and does not serve any useful function,'' concluding
that ``[d]isputes over a particular claimant's eligibility to royalties (when they arise) may be resolved internally
within a Phase II class without involvement of the Copyright Office or a CARP.'' Baseball, comments at 7&hyph;8. Copyright
Owners concurred, stating that ``[t]he parties themselves are in the best position to identify those claimants who
are not entitled to royalties,'' and that they ``do not believe...that the Copyright Office's resources (and Copyright
Owners' royalties) should be expended to screen each and every one of the thousands of claims that will be timely filed
over the years.'' Copyright Owners, reply comments at 9&hyph;10. Copyright Owners do not object, however, to the
Copyright Office returning claims that are not timely filed.

Given the pendency of receipt of cable and satellite carrier royalty claims and the request of Program Suppliers to
sever the joint claims issue from this proceeding, the Copyright Office issued an Order addressing the filing requirements
for joint claims for the 1993 cable and satellite carrier royalties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Docket Nos. RM 94&hyph;1A; 94 CARP (93&hyph;CD); 94 CARP (93&hyph;SD)(July 13, 1994). The Office stated that while
it would ``make a decision on the requirement for joint claims when we publish the final rules,'' it would waive the
requirement of identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant in &sect;252.3(a)(4) and &sect;257.3(a)(4)
for the July 1994 filing period. As a result of this action, anyone filing a joint claim for 1993 cable or satellite carrier
royalties was only required to identify at least one secondary transmission to establish a basis for the entire joint
claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office has reviewed the comments of the parties regarding the identification of a secondary transmission
requirement for joint claims and is amending &sect;252.3(a)(4) and &sect;257.3(a)(4) to require identification
of at least one secondary transmission for each joint claim, as opposed to at least one for each joint claimant.

 We have stated on several occasions that our intention in implementing the CRT Reform Act is to create a streamlined
process that limits the cost of distribution and rate adjustment proceedings to the participating parties as much
as possible.

See e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 23967 (1994). It is apparent from the unanimous opinion of the commentators that requiring identification of
a secondary transmission for each joint claimant would add in some cases a substantial burden and cost to joint claimants
without yielding an appreciable return in administrative efficiency. We are also aware that, in the past, the CRT
did not require identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant.

The amended rule, however, does require each joint claim to identify all claimants participating in the joint claim.
Those who are not identified in the joint claim may not be added to it after the filing period. An exception, however,
is made for the performing rights societies when they file cable and satellite carrier claims. If ASCAP, BMI and SESAC
were to file a joint claim, those three organizations would have to be listed in the claim, but when ASCAP, BMI and SESAC
file claims separately, they will not have to list their members or affiliates because of the burden of doing so, and
the recognition that, together, they represent virtually every composer, lyricist, and publisher entitled to royalties.

 A similar exception is not being made for the performing rights societies in the case of DART claims. There, it is not
clear that the performing rights societies represent virtually the entire composer-lyricist-publisher universe,
because they have an affirmative duty to obtain a separate written authorization to collect on behalf of their members
and affiliates and it is unknown how many of them they represent, and because there are other organizations such as
the Harry Fox Agency and the Songwriters Guild who file claims in that proceeding.

By this statement, we do not intend to prejudge controversies in the Music category. We know that there are composers,
lyricists, and publishers, such as ACEMLA and Italian Book Corporation, who are unaffiliated with the three performing
rights societies. However, to the extent that they file claims separate from the three performing rights societies,
they become identified in the filing period as independent, leaving for future proceedings their proper share vis-a-vis
the performing rights societies.

While we are eliminating the requirement of identification of a secondary transmission for each joint claimant,
we are not accepting RIAA and Baseball's recommendation of eliminating the secondary transmission identification
requirement altogether. We agree with NAB that section 111(d)(3) of the Copyright Act authorizes distribution of
cable royalties only to copyright owners whose works were retransmitted on a distant signal. Eliminating the requirement
that the claim identify at least one instance of such qualifying retransmission would effectively eviscerate the
claim requirement itself.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office also does not accept Baseball, NAB, and Copyright Owners' recommendation that the Office not review claims
for eligibility and sufficiency. Section 801(c) expressly allows the Librarian, before a CARP is convened, to ``make
any necessary procedural or evidentiary rulings that would apply to the proceedings conducted by such panel.'' We
believe that this grant of authority is broad enough to allow the Copyright Office to examine royalty claims for timeliness
and sufficiency. Furthermore, we do not accept Baseball and NAB's argument that review of claims is a waste of copyright
owners' money. Eliminating claims which are untimely filed or patently deficient on their face promotes administrative
efficiency by reducing the workload for the CARPs, which will already be pressed to conduct proceedings and issue
a report within the 180-day time period. The Copyright Office will, therefore, continue to examine royalty claims
for timeliness and sufficiency on their face.

IV. Precontroversy Discovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of all the issues generated by the CRT Reform Act and the transfer of royalty distributions and rate adjustments to
the Librarian and the CARPs, precontroversy discovery has generated the greatest amount of comment and concern.
The questions are general (Should there be any precontroversy discovery? Who should conduct it?), as well as specific
(What discovery motions may be filed? When and how will discovery orders be issued?). We have examined this controversial
issue extensively and considered all of the arguments. We are adopting as our final rule a solution that we hope will
streamline the evidentiary process for the CARPs: a limited discovery period of 45 days conducted by the Librarian
prior to declaration of a controversy requiring exchange of cases among the participating parties and one round of
discovery motions and rulings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The question of whether or not to have precontroversy discovery, defined as a period for exchange of evidence among
the parties to a distribution or rate adjustment proceeding prior to the Librarian's declaration of a controversy
and convocation of a CARP, has come full circle during the course of this rulemaking proceeding. In reaction to a statement
of Representative William Hughes, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property and Judicial Administration
of the House Committee on the Judiciary, accompanying the passage of the CRT Reform Act and commenting favorably on
the use of precontroversy discovery and exchange of information,

see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 139 Cong. Rec. H10973 (daily ed. Nov. 22, 1993), the Copyright Office proposed a precontroversy discovery period
in the NPRM. In the case of distributions, we proposed that the Librarian would declare a 90-day period for discovery
and exchange of documents sometime after the filing of royalty claims for the distribution and ending with the declaration
of the controversy. 59 FR 2550 (Jan. 18, 1994). Similarly, the Librarian would declare a 90-day period for rate adjustment
proceedings corresponding with the time period set aside for consideration of rate adjustment petitions. Any party
to a proceeding could file motions related to discovery with the Librarian during these time periods, as well as ``objections
to royalty claims or petitions, or motions for procedural or evidentiary rulings.''

We particularly seek comments on the scope of such precontroversy discovery: whether it should include interrogatories
of witnesses as well as production of supporting documents, and whether it would advance Chairman Hughes' goal of
reducing costs by being able to stipulate facts and remove issues, or whether the additional procedures might add
costs to the proceeding.

The commentators did not approve of the NPRM's precontroversy discovery proposal. In fact, the commentators urged
the Librarian and the Copyright Office to refrain completely from conducting any precontroversy discovery, and
proposed a unique solution whereby the CARPs could be convened for conducting such discovery prior to the beginning
of the 180-day arbitration period.

 59 FR 23964, 23976 (1994). Under the proposal offered by Copyright Owners, a distinction would be made between ``the
commencement of proceedings'' in 17 U.S.C. 803(d) and the ``notice initiating an arbitration proceeding'' described
in 17 U.S.C. 802(b) and (e). The Copyright Office would first declare the ``commencement of proceedings'' and then
immediately require the filing of written direct cases and empanel the CARP; discovery motions and objections would
be ruled on by the CARP. After discovery was completed, the Office would ``initiate an arbitration proceeding,''
and at that point the statutory 180-day arbitration period would begin to run. 59 FR 23977 (1994) (comments of Copyright

[A]s a matter of statutory construction, the Office cannot agree that the ``commencement of proceedings'' can be
conceptually separated from ``initiating an arbitration proceeding'' so as to permit the CARP to sit earlier than
the 180-day arbitration period. Section 802(b) (of the Copyright Act), which first uses the phrase ``initiating
an arbitration proceeding,'' employs it in the context of ``a notice in the

which &sect;802(b) refers is the ``notice of commencement of proceedings.'' Therefore, the phrases refer to each
other and must be considered synonymous. (parenthetical added).

by the Librarian; and (3) submission of and ruling on direct case discovery motions and objections by the Librarian,

Copyright Owners ask the Copyright Office to reconsider their proposal of convening CARPs prior to commencement
of the 180-day arbitration period, suggesting that the Office could consider that the phrases ``notice initiating
an arbitration proceeding'' and ``notice of commencement of proceedings'' have different meanings and therefore
could constitute two separate events. For the reasons described in the Interim Regulations, however, the Office
is adhering to its position that CARPs may not be convened prior to the commencement of the 180-day arbitration period.

Copyright Owners argue that in order for precontroversy discovery to be in any way productive, the Copyright Office
rules must be amended to require the parties to a proceeding to exchange their direct cases prior to the commencement
of arbitration, as opposed to after a CARP has been convened. Copyright Owners, comments at 3&hyph;5, 7&hyph;10.
They assert that without an exchange of direct cases, precontroversy discovery would become a fishing expedition
as the parties attempt to guess at each other's theory of the case and principal evidence. Exchange of direct cases
would allow the parties to focus on the evidence that will be presented at a hearing and reduce the amount of time the
CARPs will need to devote to discovery matters.

We have carefully considered the views of the Copyright Owners with respect to precontroversy discovery, especially
in light of their request that the CARPs conduct precontroversy discovery and our earlier proposal set forth in the
NPRM. For reasons stated in the Interim Regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 23977, we do not believe that it is statutorily permissible to convene a CARP prior to the beginning of the 180-day
arbitration period for the purposes of conducting precontroversy discovery. We reaffirm our decision that the CARPs
cannot conduct or permit discovery prior to the beginning of the 180-day arbitration period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the proposal of the Copyright Owners, however, we do think that it is appropriate that the Librarian
of Congress and the Copyright Office conduct some precontroversy discovery. We are therefore adopting a precontroversy
discovery procedure similar to that now being endorsed by the Copyright Owners and initially proposed in the NPRM.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We therefore amend &sect;251.45 of the rules to provide a procedure for conducting precontroversy discovery. New
paragraph (b) directs the Librarian to designate a 45-day period for the conduct of precontroversy discovery. The
Librarian shall designate the dates for the 45-day precontroversy discovery period on a case-by-case basis after
receiving and reviewing comments on the existence of controversies and notices of intention to participate described
in &sect;251.45(a). During this time period, the parties will exchange their written direct cases and the Librarian
will entertain motions and objections regarding discovery matters, motions and objections to dismiss any party's
royalty claim, motions for declaratory rulings or for procedural or evidentiary rulings, petitions to dispense
with formal hearings under &sect;251.41(b), and objections to arbitrators under &sect;251.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

As stated in the Interim Regulations, ``[w]e agree with the Copyright Owners that precontroversy discovery before
the filing of written direct cases would not be productive.'' 59 FR 23977 (1994). The 45-day precontroversy discovery
period therefore shall begin with an exchange of written direct cases among the parties to the proceeding. Each party
must serve one complete copy of their written direct case on each of the parties to the proceeding no later than the first
day of the 45-day period. At any time during the 45-day period, the parties may file their motions and objections with
the Librarian. Objections to any and all motions will be due seven days after the filing date for motions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 45-day designated period shall be the sole time for filing precontroversy motions and objections. Any motions
and objections received prior to, or after, the 45-day period will be returned. The Librarian will rule on motions
and objections after the 45-day period has ended and prior to the declaration of the existence of a controversy. However,
motions for production of documents or to compel production of evidence should be ruled upon by the Librarian within
five days of receipt of the motion so as to expedite the discovery process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the exchange of direct cases and the filing of motions and objections, the Librarian will set the date
on which controversies will be declared. We agree with Copyright Owners that fixing a date certain for declaration
of controversies and initiation of arbitration proceedings will allow potential arbitrators and participating
parties to clear their schedules, as well as afford the participating parties more time to prepare their cases.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

record as to the petitioner's significant interest and receiving notices of intention to participate, and after
the period described in &sect;251.63(a), the Librarian will issue a precontroversy discovery scheduling order
identical to that for distribution proceedings. The Librarian will require exchange of direct cases, conduct the
one round of motions and objections, issue appropriate rulings, and announce the date on which initiation of arbitration
proceedings will begin.

The determination of ``significant'' interest is not required for the noncommercial educational broadcasting

We believe that these precontroversy discovery and scheduling regulations should provide a workable solution to
the time pressures of distribution and rate adjustment proceedings, and should sharpen the focus of the proceedings
by eliminating much of the preliminary work that would be faced by the CARPs without such procedures. We agree with
the Copyright Owners that 17 U.S.C. 801(c), coupled with Chairman Hughes' floor statement regarding precontroversy
discovery, provides ample statutory authority for the Librarian and the Copyright Office to conduct precontroversy
discovery and issue rulings. It may be that, with some issues, the Librarian will designate the issue raised during
the 45-day precontroversy discovery period to the appropriate CARP for disposition, but it is our belief that the
Librarian will be able to dispose of most precontroversy discovery issues.

EIA supports the Copyright Office position for both section 1004(a)(3) royalty maximum adjustment and section 1010
arbitration. EIA notes that section 801 of the Copyright Act contains no reference to royalty maximum adjustments
or section 1010 arbitration, and that the Copyright Office correctly observed that the former Copyright Royalty
Tribunal's duty to ``carry out its other responsibilities under chapter 10'' was expressly repealed from section
801 in the CRT Reform Act. EIA, comments at 2. Absent jurisdictional authorization, EIA argues that section 1010 is
outside the scope of the CARPs. Furthermore, EIA notes that CARP procedures are inconsistent with section 1010 arbitration;
a petition initiates CARP rate adjustments whereas agreement of the parties is necessary to initiate section 1010
arbitration.

royalty rate adjustments and distributions.

The Copyright Office reaffirms the conclusion announced in the Interim Regulations that proceedings under sections
1004(a)(3) and 1010 are not within the jurisdiction of the CARPs. 59 FR 23967 (1994). Proceedings to adjust the royalty
maximum under section 1004(a)(3) shall therefore be handled solely by the Librarian, and proceedings under section
1010 shall not be subject to the rules and regulations governing the CARPs. It may be that an arbitration panel convened
under section 1010 chooses to use some or all of the rules applicable to CARP proceedings; that choice, however, is
up to the arbitration panel.

With respect to the division of costs among the parties participating in a section 1004(a)(3) or section 1010 proceeding,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of the costs involved in the entire CARP process was understandably a serious concern of a number of commentators.
These concerns included the payment and fees charged by arbitrators, deductions from royalty pools, and billing
cycles for arbitrators. The commentators offered some unique solutions to these problems, some of which we are adopting
in these Final Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 251.54, 251.65 and 251.74 are the principal regulations governing the costs of CARP proceedings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 251.54 directs the CARP panels in the case of rate adjustment proceedings to establish each participating
party's share of the costs of the proceeding. In the case of distribution proceedings, each participating party's
cost is in direct proportion to its share of the distribution. Sections 251.65 and 251.74 allow the Library of Congress
and the Copyright Office to recover their respective costs for rate adjustment and distribution proceedings. For
rate adjustments, the Librarian and Office may deduct their reasonable costs from the relevant royalty pool. If no
such pool exists, then the participating parties' costs shall be assessed directly to them. In distribution proceedings,
reasonable costs may be deducted directly from the relevant royalty pool.

A. Assessment of Arbitrator Costs in Distribution Proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We concluded in the Interim Regulations that we did not have the authority to deduct the costs of the CARPs from the relevant
royalty pool, and could only deduct our costs. We noted that this was an unsatisfactory result, and described our effort
to have Congress amend the statute. 59 FR 23977 (1994). Our proposed statutory amendment would allow the Librarian
and the Copyright Office to deduct a CARP's costs from the relevant royalty pool, and pay the arbitrators with such
deductions, before the fees were distributed to copyright claimants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners noted a problem with our proposal, specifically the provision which provided that deductions would
be made ``before the fees are distributed to any copyright claimants.'' Copyright Owners submit that this sentence
could be interpreted as suggesting that all royalty fees must remain on deposit until the final deduction for the costs
of a CARP proceeding has been made. Such an interpretation, they argue, ``would contradict the authority to make partial
distribution as found elsewhere in the statute and present a serious hardship to Copyright Owners because of the potential
long delay between collection of royalty fees and their distribution after an arbitration hearing.'' Copyright
Owners, comments at 35. They therefore recommend that the provision be amended to read ``Such deduction shall be made
before the fees are fully distributed to all copyright claimants.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aside from the legislative solution, the commentators offer other ways for handling the payment and costs of the CARPs.
Copyright Owners offer a unique proposal: make a substantial partial distribution of royalties at an early stage
of each distribution proceeding to an escrow account administered jointly by all of the claimants. The sole purpose
of the escrow account would be to make funds available for timely payment of monthly CARP member billings, while avoiding
the need for advance cash outlays from the claimants. Copyright Owners, comments at 33. Further partial distributions
to the escrow account could, if necessary, be made during the proceeding, and any excess remaining after all CARP bills
are paid could be distributed in accordance with the final distribution determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RIAA/AARC generally supports the proposed escrow account, but expresses concern that in DART proceedings, the escrow
account could be depleted by monthly CARP payments before the end of the proceeding. RIAA/AARC also points out that
monthly payments in a DART distribution proceeding are problematic since there has not yet been a DART distribution
decision and there is no precedent to follow for division of royalties among the claimants and each claimant's pro
rata share of expenses. RIAA/AARC, reply comments at 2&hyph;3. RIAA/AARC therefore recommends that the Copyright
Office deduct all CARP expenses from the royalty pool at the end of a distribution proceeding, citing 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1)
and 802(c) as providing the Office with authority to make such deductions. RIAA/AARC, comments at 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The method of payment of the CARPs is a problem, especially given our lack of statutory authority to pay the arbitrators
directly. Unfortunately, the legislative solution discussed in the Interim Regulations, 59 FR 23977, failed for
this Congress. Thus, we cannot pay the CARPs. We will seek the necessary statutory authority in the 104th Congress.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of our lack of authority in this area, we are not adopting any regulations governing the method of payment of
CARP costs. As discussed above, the Copyright Owners proposed the creation of an escrow account, administered by
the parties, to pay the arbitrators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compensation of the arbitrators is the responsibility of the parties to a proceeding. 17 U.S.C. 802(g). If Copyright
Owners wish to establish such an escrow account, and can obtain the consent of all parties to the proceeding, they are
free to do so. We note that in the proceeding to adjust royalty rates for the section 119 satellite carrier license in
1991, the parties paid an upfront sum to those arbitrators to begin the proceeding, and a final payment at the conclusion
of the proceeding. We offer no opinion as to whether this is the appropriate manner in which to proceed, but offer it
as a possibility to be considered by the CARPs who have the authority to direct the ``manner and proportion'' of payment
of a CARP's costs.

B. Assessment of Library of Congress and Copyright Office Costs in Rate Adjustment Proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.65 of the Interim Regulations allows the Library and Copyright Office to deduct their costs in rate adjustment
proceedings from the ``relevant royalty pool,'' and, if no such pool exists, to assess the costs directly to the parties
to the proceeding. RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners oppose deductions from royalty pools for rate adjustment proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RIAA/AARC submits that &sect;251.65 is contrary to the intent of the CRT Reform Act. They note that 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1)
provides for assessment of costs directly to parties where ``no royalty pool exists from which [the Library and Copyright
Office's] costs can be deducted_i.e. a rate adjustment proceeding.'' Thus, according to RIAA/AARC, deductions
can only be made from royalty pools in distribution proceedings and not in rate adjustment proceedings. RIAA/AARC,
comments at 10&hyph;11. Furthermore, if costs are deducted from the relevant royalty pool for rate adjustment proceedings,
then copyright owners will bear the entire brunt of the proceeding in contradiction to the Office's determination
that both owners and users should share the cost of rate adjustments.

Copyright Owners believe that a portion of the costs of a rate adjustment could be deducted from a royalty pool, but
submit that it is difficult to identify exactly what is the ``relevant'' royalty pool. Copyright Owners, reply comments
at 1&hyph;2. Rate adjustment proceedings involve the setting of rates for future, not-yet-collected royalty funds.
The ``relevant'' pools would therefore be the future funds affected by the rate change, rather than past funds. Copyright
Owners submit that the Office should therefore seek the comments of the owners as to what is the proper meaning of the
word ``relevant.''

 at 5. Furthermore, Copyright Owners argue that it is completely unfair for owners to bear all of the Office's expenses
for rate adjustments, since users clearly benefit as well from the adjustments. They ask that the Office reinstate
the deduction rule proposed in the NPRM which simply provides that rate adjustment costs will be assessed ``directly
to the parties participating in the proceedings.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 6 (citing 59 FR at 2565 (1994)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners raise valid points with respect to &sect;251.65. As we stated in the Interim
Regulations, we believe that the burden of the Library and Office's costs in a rate adjustment proceeding should be
shared by both owners and users. We did not intend to place the burden solely on copyright owners, although it is arguable
that &sect;251.65 appears to do that very thing. We also agree with Copyright Owners' assessment that the ``relevant''
royalty pool is not clear; it would seem that it may be necessary to amortize the costs over a number of royalty pools.
In an attempt to solve these problems, we are therefore accepting Copyright Owners' suggestion of reinstating &sect;251.65
as proposed in the NPRM. The section therefore now reads: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 17 U.S.C. 802(h)(1), the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights may assess the reasonable
costs incurred by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office as a result of the rate adjustment proceedings directly
to the parties participating in the proceedings.

C. Frivolous Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both RIAA/AARC and Copyright Owners are concerned with the costs that may be generated by frivolous claimants to royalty
distributions. Section 251.54(a)(2) provides that CARPs may assess their costs in direct proportion to each party's
share of the distribution. Thus, a party who received 0% of the distribution would bear 0% of the costs, even though
the claim of that party may have contributed greatly to the costs of the other claimants. RIAA/AARC believes that every
party participating in a distribution proceeding should be prepared to bear some portion of the procedural costs,
regardless of whether or not it receives any portion of the royalty fund. RIAA/AARC, reply comments at 3. They recommend
that the Office adopt some type of participation fee for distribution proceedings, similar to that used by other government
agencies conducting proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 4. In lieu of a participation fee, RIAA/AARC recommends that the CARPs be granted the discretion to allocate a share
of expenses of the proceeding to bad faith or frivolous claimants who receive little or no share of the distribution.

4&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners echo RIAA/AARC's concerns regarding frivolous claims and the added costs associated with those
claimants. Copyright Owners, however, would resolve the problem by an amendment to the statute which they propose
the Copyright Office seek. Such an amendment would provide that ``upon a finding of bad faith or other frivolous or
vexatious conduct, the Librarian may allow a different allocation of costs of the proceedings as necessary to respond
to such conduct.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 38. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to costs in distribution proceedings, section 802(c) is quite clear in providing that ``the parties shall
bear the cost in direct proportion to their share of the distribution.'' 17 U.S.C. 802(c). No provision is made to charge
parties fees for participating in distribution proceedings, or assessing costs against parties for frivolous behavior
or claims. We cannot imply or interpret the statute to provide for such measures, nor are we prepared to seek an amendment
of the statute to allow the Librarian to make an assessment of a claimant's conduct or behavior and impose an additional
share of the cost of the proceedings against that party. Since the Librarian is only charged with handling matters
preliminary to the arbitration and reviewing the CARP's decision, the Librarian is not in a proper position to evaluate
the conduct of participants to a proceeding. There is no authority in the statute for the CARPs to change 17 U.S.C. 802(c)'s
direction to assess costs in direct proportion to each party's share of the distribution, nor is there authority for
the CARPs to sanction parties or individuals to a proceeding. The CARPs are, however, in the best position to assess
the conduct of the participants to a distribution proceeding. Deliberate misrepresentation to a CARP by a party or
individual to a proceeding will be referred by the Copyright Office to the Justice Department for possible prosecution
under the applicable provisions of title 18 of the United States Code.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Arbitrator Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.54(a) provides that a CARP may ``assess its ordinary and necessary costs'' to the participants to a proceeding.
NMPA/HFA urges the Office to adopt a mechanism for appealing the reasonableness of fees and expenses assessed. They
recommend creation of a procedure, although they do not describe what kind of procedure or when and how it could be invoked,
whereby the Librarian would be available in instances where the parties question the fees and expenses charged. NMPA/HFA,
comments at 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are declining to adopt a fee review procedure at this time because we believe that the rules already contain adequate
safeguards. Section 251.38 governs billing and provides that ``[a]rbitrators are bound by the hourly or daily fee
they proposed to the Librarian of Congress when their names were submitted to be listed under &sect;251.3, and shall
not bill in excess of their proposed charges.'' 59 FR 23986 (1994). Subsection (b) further provides that ``[a]rbitrators
shall not charge the parties any expenses in addition to their hourly or daily charge.'' The safeguards in these rules
are reinforced by the agreement the arbitrators must sign stating they will abide by the terms of these Final Regulations
including ``the billing restrictions specified in this subpart.'' &sect;251.38(e). The regulations already contain
substantial provisions to assure that arbitrators not charge excessive rates or expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although our regulations do not specifically address the number of hours for which an arbitrator can charge, we expect
that the arbitrators will be fair and charge for the actual amount of time they devoted to the proceedings. In some cases,
the amount spent may be more or less for one arbitrator than it is for another. Should an arbitrator charge for an unreasonable
number of hours that could not possibly bear any relationship to the amount of work performed, we believe that such
action would amount to an ethical violation subject to the remedies of &sect;251.39. We do not, however, intend to
judge or measure the amount of time it should take an arbitrator to perform a specific task, and we therefore decline
to create a billing review procedure.

VII. Final Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a section-by-section summary of the amended regulations, together with a discussion of the applicable
comments on the corresponding provisions of the Interim Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Part 251_Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels Rules of Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 251 contains most of the rules and procedures governing the operation of the CARPs and, like the rules proposed
in the NPRM, received the greatest number of observations and suggestions from the commentators. It is divided into
seven subparts, identified as subparts A through F. Subpart A, entitled ``Organization,'' describes the composition
and selection process for the CARPs. Subparts B and C, ``Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings''
and ``Public Access to and Inspection of Records,'' remain virtually the same as those adopted in the Interim Regulations,
with only a few minor amendments. Subpart D, ``Standards of Conduct,'' prescribes the financial and ethical requirements
for arbitrators, and governs 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications, billing, sanctions for misconduct, and other matters involving ethical standards. Subpart E,
``Procedures of Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels,'' prescribes the procedures to be followed by the CARPs in
conducting proceedings, including those governing submission of evidence, conduct of hearings, reports of the
CARPs, and orders of the Librarian. Subparts F and G,'' Rate Adjustment Proceedings'' and ``Royalty Fee Distribution
Proceedings,'' provide certain additional requirements inherent in rate adjustment and distribution proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have already described most of the major issues raised by the commentators to the Interim Regulations and discussed
our responses and amendments. The following summarizes other additions and changes to the Interim Regulations in
the various subparts of part 251. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

Arbitrator lists. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.3 describes the information that must be submitted to the Librarian by an arbitration association for
each person to be eligible to serve on a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. Section 251.3(a)(5) requires ``a description
or schedule detailing fees proposed to be charged by the person for service on a CARP.'' James Cannings submits that
the proposed fees ``should reflect the current market daily or hourly rate as are charged by arbitrators who serve
National Arbitration Associations, such as, the Arbitration Association of America.'' Cannings, comments at 2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons stated above in the discussion of our rejection of a fee schedule, it is not appropriate for the Librarian
or the Copyright Office to impose fee restrictions on persons seeking to be arbitrators. Although the fee information
provided by a potential arbitrator will have a bearing on his or her selection, we decline to amend &sect;251.3(a)(5)
to adopt fee limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Qualifications of the arbitrators.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As was the case with the comments filed in response to the NPRM in this rulemaking proceeding, Copyright Owners had
disparate opinions regarding the requirement in &sect;251.5 that all CARP arbitrators be admitted to the practice
of law. Program Suppliers filed a separate comment in response to the Interim Regulations devoted solely to arguing
that the Librarian should also consider non-lawyers in the selection process, while other copyright owners identified
as Certain Copyright Owners filed a separate comment urging that the Copyright Office retain the requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Suppliers advance essentially the same argument, which they made in response to the NPRM, that allowing non-lawyers
as arbitrators could prove invaluable in expediting the arbitration process: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In reaching its ruling, the Office ignored the important value that non-lawyers with expertise in the types of statistical
and economic studies that comprise the heart and body of distribution and rate adjustment evidence could bring to
the decisionmaking process. Having arbitrators who are familiar with statistical and economic studies similar
to those presented in prior rate adjustment and distribution proceedings would give each panel added competence
to deal with the substantive issues raised, and thus assist the decisionmaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is ironic, to say the least, that the Office's ruling was based on a concern about the lack of time for non-lawyers
to learn the nuances of legal rulings, but ignored the possibility that lawyer-arbitrators might have absolutely
no familiarity with the type of complex studies presented by expert witnesses over and over again in prior distribution
and rate adjustment hearings. Although legal rulings can affect certain aspects of a hearing, interpretation and
understanding of the conflicting substantive evidence is crucial to reasoned final determinations setting rates
or distribution royalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Suppliers, comments at 2&hyph;3. Program Suppliers believe that retaining subsection (c) of &sect;251.5
requiring arbitrators to have ``[e]xperience in conducting arbitration proceedings or facilitating the resolution
and settlement of disputes'' would satisfactorily provide the potential arbitrator with the type of experience
necessary to conduct arbitration proceedings.

Certain Copyright Owners argue that Program Suppliers' arguments have already been rejected in the Interim Regulations,
and that Program Suppliers fail to make any showing that ``the list already developed will fail to yield at least three
Panel members who are capable of resolving royalty disputes in a fair and efficient manner.'' Certain Copyright Owners,
reply comments at 2. Certain Copyright Owners believe that economic expertise is not necessary, and might cause an
undue bias among the panel members.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office has reconsidered the lawyer requirement imposed by &sect;251.5 and reaffirms its decision
to retain the requirement. It appears that Program Suppliers are not so much concerned with allowing non-lawyers
to serve on CARP panels as they are with seeing economists among the listed arbitrators. Section 251.5 in no way prevents
economists or those with economic training from serving on a CARP, provided that they are admitted to the practice
of law. Furthermore, we agree with Certain Copyright Owners' observation that Program Suppliers have failed to demonstrate
any deficiency in the quality of experience of the potential arbitrators appearing on the current list. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 24486 (1994). The listed arbitrators have diverse backgrounds and training, including economic expertise.
Moreover, all of the listed persons have experience in the practice of law which, given the shortness of the arbitration
period, is important in the efficiency and speedy disposition of CARP proceedings. The Copyright Office, therefore,
declines to make any changes to &sect;251.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(2) Subpart B_Public Access to Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel Meetings

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CARP Meetings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright Owners make several suggestions with respect to meetings of the CARPs. Because confidential proprietary
information is sometimes introduced into the record, it is necessary for the CARP to close a meeting for the purposes
of receiving that information. When confidential material is involved in only a limited portion of the meeting, it
is not necessary to close the entire meeting. The Interim Regulations, however, provide only for the closing of an
entire meeting. Copyright Owners therefore suggest that &sect;&sect;251.11(b) and 251.13 be amended to make clear
that a CARP may close only that part of a meeting during which confidential information is discussed; all other portions
of the meeting, however, would be open. Copyright Owners, comments at 26. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners also note that because it is often impossible to determine when and if confidential information
may be disclosed at a meeting, it may be impossible to give the seven-day advance notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 required by &sect;251.11(b). Copyright Owners therefore suggest that a general notice of the possibility of the
introduction of confidential information during the course of a hearing should suffice to meet the notice requirements
even though it would be impossible to provide a specific date and time of the closed portion of the meeting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue raised by Copyright Owners is the treatment of a CARP's internal deliberations. According to Copyright
Owners, a literal reading of Subpart B would apply to confidential deliberations among CARP arbitrators. ``Thus,
for example, if the members of a CARP want to talk over an objection to testimony during the course of a hearing before
ruling on it, they would be obliged to have that discussion transcribed and to announce the fact of that confidential
`meeting' in the

at 26&hyph;27. Copyright Owners therefore propose that the procedures of &sect;&sect;251.14 and 251.15 be modified
so that (a) transcripts or minutes are not necessary for internal CARP deliberations, and (b) the procedures for closed
meetings in &sect;251.14 do not apply to such deliberations.

The points made by Copyright Owners are well taken. In order to allow CARPs to close only a portion of a meeting, as opposed
to an entire meeting, for the taking of confidential information and related material, we are amending &sect;&sect;251.11(b)
and 251.13 by adding the phrase ``any portion of a meeting.'' With respect to seven-day advance publication notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of a meeting that may be closed in part or in whole, we agree that a general notice of the possibility of the introduction
of confidential information should suffice to satisfy the notice requirements. The notice of publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 therefore shall, as a matter of policy, contain such a general statement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, with respect to the procedures required for closed meetings applying to CARP deliberations, we agree with
Copyright Owners that application of those procedures is neither desirable nor appropriate. We are therefore amending
&sect;251.14 by adding a new subsection (d) which provides that ``[t]he procedure for closed meetings in this section
and &sect;251.15 shall not apply to the internal deliberations of arbitrators carried out in furtherance of their
duties and obligations under this chapter.''

Financial conflict of interests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When we originally proposed financial conflict of interest rules, our main concern was with their proper scope. Did
we propose rules that did not cover enough situations, and therefore miss some very real conflicts of interest, or,
on the other hand, did our proposed rules go too far, and eliminate qualified persons for inconsequential reasons?
In an effort to reach the proper scope, we not only proposed rules, but we also asked for comments on certain hypothetical
situations that went beyond the scope of our proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Owners' response reflects the difficulty of drawing the proper line. While they offered opinions about
the hypothetical situations that indicated a belief that our proposed rules did not go far enough, ultimately they
did not ask to expand the rules, but proposed handling the gray area questions on a case-by-case basis, using the disclosure
procedure to the parties described in section 251.32(b)(2) as a method to decide whether the conflict is disqualifying.
The Copyright Owners stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Copyright Owners believe that decisions about the financial conflicts of potential arbitrators must be made on a
case-by-case basis, with no single application of the rules being dispositive on a specific case.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.
The screening of arbitrators for any panel ought not to occur through rote application of the rules *&blank;*&blank;*
If the Librarian finds a question arising as to whether a conflict exists as to a particular arbitrator, further information
should be made available to the parties so that they may determine whether the person should be disqualified or whether
the potential conflict might be waived.

Copyright Owners, comments at 21. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the Copyright Owners that this is the proper approach. Therefore, we have not modified the scope of the
financial conflict of interest rules, but we have made a change in the disclosure rule, section 251.32(b)(2). Whenever
a potential arbitrator has a conflict of interest as defined by our rules and has indicated that he or she wants this
conflict to be disclosed to the parties, or whenever a potential arbitrator has an interest beyond the specified scope
of the rules which raises our concern, section 251.32(b)(2) provides we will list these interests anonymously in
an order issued to the parties to each upcoming proceeding at the time the Librarian establishes for precontroversy
motions, and we will request that the parties indicate within 30 days which conflicts or potential conflicts they
believe are disqualifying. For those interests within the scope of our conflict of interest rules, the indications
of the parties will be dispositive. For those potential conflicts outside of the scope of our conflict of interest
rules, the indications of the parties will aid the Librarian in his decision.

For example, arbitrator X has a spouse who is employed by one of the parties to the proceeding. Because that is a interest
within the scope of our rules, the response of the parties will be dispositive. That is, if any one of the parties objects,
arbitrator X may not serve. On the other hand, if arbitrator X has a parent who is employed by one of the parties, that
would be an interest outside of the scope of our rules. In that case, if one or more of the parties objects, that objection
will be taken into account when the Librarian makes his decision, but the objection will not automatically disqualify
arbitrator X.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was, however, one area in which the Copyright Owners commented that the scope of the conflict of interest rules
was too broad. Section 251.31(d)(3) imputes the financial interest of the arbitrator's general partner to the arbitrator.
The Copyright Owners believe that section 251.31(d)(3) means that each potential arbitrator would have to inquire
of each of his/her general partners about their personal investments. The Copyright Owners consider this an unworkable
burden and doubt that any potential arbitrator would be influenced by the personal holdings of a general partner,
especially if that general partner's financial interest is unknown to the arbitrator. The Copyright Owners ask that
an exception to the rule on imputation of interests be made in the case of a general partner's personal financial holdings.
Copyright Owners, comments at 24&hyph;25. We agree, and section 251.31(d)(3) has been modified to reflect this exception.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ex parte communications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our proposed interim rules, distinctions were made among four classes of persons concerning ex parte communications:
(1) the Librarian of Congress and the Register of Copyrights, (2) the selected arbitrators, (3) the listed arbitrators,
and (4) the Library and Copyright Office personnel. In particular, we drew a distinction between selected arbitrators
who are subject to a total ban on contact between them and interested parties in their controversy, and listed arbitrators
who are not subject to a total ban on contact, but who may not communicate with any interested party about the merits
of any past, pending, or future proceeding relating to CARP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Copyright Owners and James Cannings state that they believe no distinction should be made between selected
and listed arbitrators, and that there should be a total ban on contact with all arbitrators. The Copyright Owners
argue for the highest standard concerning selected and listed arbitrators because of ``the substantial financial
interests at stake.'' The Copyright Owners, however, would mitigate the severity of a total ban to permit nonsubstantive
pleasantries between arbitrators and parties. Finally, the Copyright Owners note that the restrictions concerning
arbitrators are against contact with any interested ``party'' and would prefer that it be changed to ``person'' because
of what they believe to be the ambiguous meaning of the word ``party.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 15&hyph;18.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having reviewed the comments of the Copyright Owners and James Cannings, we continue to believe that the distinction
between selected and listed arbitrators is valid. In any given year, 75 persons will be listed to be available to serve
as arbitrators. A total ban on contact with all 75 persons would be unworkable, and unfair to the persons offering their
services. For the remote chance of being selected, they would be giving up a degree of personal freedom, not for any
actual impropriety but for the avoidance of the appearance of impropriety. However, we believe it is fair and highly
necessary that listed arbitrators understand that they may not engage in any actual impropriety, that is, discuss
the merits of any royalty proceeding, past, present or future. This is a much narrower and more appropriately tailored
limitation on their activities. Once selected, the total ban on contact with the three selected arbitrators is essential.
It assures fairness to all parties by guaranteeing that no opportunity for influence can possibly occur. Procedural
requests of the selected arbitrators should be routed through Library or Copyright Office personnel who are assigned
to support the arbitrators.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do agree, however, with the Copyright Owners' request that innocent pleasantries should not be subject to the total
ban, and that the word ``party'' should be changed to ``person'' to avoid any ambiguity. The changes to section 251.33
have been made accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Gifts and other things of monetary value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In our interim rules, we make a distinction between selected arbitrators who are subject to a total ban on soliciting
or accepting gifts or any other thing of monetary value from an interested person, and listed arbitrators who may solicit
or accept gifts of less than $20 per occasion, and not more than $50 per year from any one source. We also provide that
a listed arbitrator may accept a gift beyond the $20&hyph;$50 limit where it is clear that the gift is motivated by a
family relationship or a personal friendship rather than the potential of the listed arbitrator to be selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Owners and James Cannings believe that no distinction should be made between selected and listed arbitrators
and that they should all abide by a total ban on the soliciting or acceptance of any gift. The Copyright Owners state
that applying the total ban to listed arbitrators would ``reduce the perceived opportunities for influencing of
either listed or selected arbitrators.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Again, as stated above, we believe that the restrictions on the activities of listed arbitrators should be limited
to actual improprieties only, considering that they may never be selected. Requiring listed arbitrators to refuse
gifts no matter how small, and to avoid normal relations with existing friends and family simply to avoid the appearance
of impropriety is too great a restriction, and may result in various individuals refusing to participate. The exceptions
for nominally valued gifts and for gifts from existing friends and family were derived from the regulations issued
by the Office of Government Ethics, and represent their line-drawing for thousands of compensated government employees
who are in a position to confer a benefit on a private party (versus listed arbitrators who are neither compensated
nor in a position to confer a benefit). We do not believe that a lunch valued at less than $20 where no discussion of the
merits of any past, present or future proceeding takes place would result in the influencing of any listed arbitrator.
Consequently, the distinction between selected and listed arbitrators is retained in the final rules.

Post-arbitration employment restrictions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we did not receive any comments on our rule against arbitrators being employed for three years by any party, person
or entity with a financial interest in the proceeding, we did receive a comment on the hypothetical we posed based on
this section. The hypothetical asked whether an arbitrator who has ruled on a cable rate adjustment may take a cable
system as a client afterwards if that cable system, although affected by the outcome, had neither participated in
the proceeding nor authorized anyone else to represent it. The Copyright Owners stated that they believed the arbitrator
could take the cable system as a client, but gave no reasons, and prefaced their answers to all the hypotheticals by
saying they were difficult to answer given the limited facts available. Copyright Owners, comments at 22, 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that since we received only one limited comment on this hypothetical, we do not have sufficient comments
to render a conclusion. We reserve judgment until an actual case presents itself. In the meantime, the rule is adopted
as proposed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Remedies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, section 251.39 provides sanctions against selected arbitrators, listed arbitrators, and outside parties
who violate the standards of conduct. The Copyright Owners argue that sanctions should also be put in place for Library
and Copyright Office personnel who violate the standards. Copyright Owners, comments at 24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Library of Congress Regulations (LCRs) already set forth sanctions for Library and Copyright Office personnel who
violate internal personnel rules. LCR 2023&hyph;1 instructs all staff members to avoid actions which might result
in or create the appearance of using public office for private gain, giving inequitable and improper preferential
treatment to any person to the prejudice or detriment of others, or compromising the independence or impartiality
of the Library. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe this applies to the rules on ex parte communications, and would cover any disclosure of nonpublic information,
even though section 251.37 only applies to arbitrators. In addition, however, the Library's General Counsel, who
serves as the agency's ethics officer, has issued a memorandum that will be circulated to all personnel likely to have
any interaction with a CARP detailing the new situations that could arise and how employees should respond to them.

(i) Phase I/Phase II. In the preamble text to the Interim Regulations, we asked several questions with regard to the
procedural division of royalty distribution proceedings. The Copyright Royalty Tribunal traditionally divided
distribution proceedings into two phases: Phase I determined the percentage allocation among the categories of
claimants, while Phase II resolved disputes within a claimant category. The Tribunal practice, however, was just
that, and was never embodied in the rules. We sought comment on the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Is the procedure of dividing a cable distribution proceeding into Phases I and II a precedent that is binding on the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If not, should it nonetheless be followed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it should be followed, should we adopt rules governing the procedure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should those rules include a definition of each of the Phase I categories?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright Owners urge that, regardless of the binding effect of the former Tribunal's practice on the Office, the
division of proceedings into Phase I and Phase II should continue in order to prevent chaos in the distribution process.
Copyright Owners, comments at 13. They note that Phase I claimant categories offer two primary benefits to the distribution
process. First, by allowing each claimant category to collect the total royalty awarded to it and distribute that
total to its individual claimants, the ``process frees the Copyright Office from the expense of mailing hundreds
of distribution checks to individual claimants each time a distribution is made.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office believes that the division of distribution proceedings into Phase I and Phase II categories
provides an efficient manner for conducting such proceedings, and therefore will retain the use of the categories.
In dividing distribution proceedings into Phase I and Phase II categories, we will look to Tribunal precedent for
guidance, as well as the exigencies of each individual case. For these reasons, we do not believe that it is necessary
to adopt separate procedures for Phase I and Phase II proceedings, as is suggested by Copyright Owners. The Copyright
Royalty Tribunal functioned for fifteen years without separate rules for each type of proceeding, and exercised
its discretion to divide each distribution into Phase I and Phase II categories on a case-by-case basis. The procedural
rules of the subchapter applicable to distribution proceedings apply with equal basis to each controversy, regardless
of whether it is Phase I or Phase II, and therefore do not require separate sets of rules. Furthermore, it is the Librarian
who shall determine the number and category of controversies in each distribution proceeding, and submit each controversy
or controversies to one or more CARPs as is appropriate. Copyright Owners are therefore correct in their assertion,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 comments at 14&hyph;15, that the nature and extent of controversies in one royalty distribution proceeding may require
the convocation of more than one CARP for resolution. Thus, for example, a CARP may be convened to resolve controversies
in Phase I, and another may be required at a later date to resolve controversies in Phase II. The only way to make such
determinations is on a case-by-case basis, as was done by the former Tribunal, and the Office therefore heeds the advice
of Copyright Owners by declining to adopt rules governing the identification and classification of Phase I/Phase
II procedures which could ``create unnecessary rigidity that would fail to accommodate changing conditions.''
Copyright Owners, comments at 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Copyright Office also accepts Copyright Owners' suggestion of allowing parties to a proceeding to stipulate
the definitions of Phase I categories and programs to the arbitrators in that proceeding. In order to allow arbitrators
a sufficient amount of time to become familiar with the definitions, the Librarian will, in the notice establishing
the 45-day precontroversy discovery period, instruct the parties to the proceeding to stipulate a complete set of
definitions by the end of the precontroversy discovery period. If the parties are unable to reach agreement by that
date, the Copyright Office will, in accordance with our authority to provide support to the CARPs under 17 U.S.C. 801(d),
provide the arbitrators with the necessary definitions of Phase I categories and programs to allow them to accomplish
their task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Paper proceedings. Section 251.41(b) permits the parties to a proceeding to petition the Librarian to have their
controversy decided solely on the submission of written pleadings. The petition may be granted if ``(1) there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact, or (2) all parties to the controversy agree with the petition.'' 59 FR 23976 (1994).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners believe that &sect;251.41(b)(2) is in need of clarification. They note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As currently drafted, Section 251.41(b)(2) allows rulings only in uncontested cases where ``all parties to the controversy
agree with the petition.'' Of course, if all parties agree with the petition, then there would be no need for a ruling.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners believe that Section 251.41(b)(2) was intended to allow ruling where all parties agree 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
with the request 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
that the issue be decided by petition, regardless of whether they agree with the merits of the petition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Copyright Owners' point is well taken. The intention of the rule is to allow the parties to a proceeding to petition
the Librarian and dispense with formal proceedings. The CARP panel would then decide the controversy or rate adjustment
on the basis of written pleadings only, i.e., a ``paper'' proceeding. In deciding whether to allow a paper proceeding
before a CARP, the petition must demonstrate that (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact involved in the proceeding
(not the petition), or else 2) the parties unamimously agree that they wish to have a paper proceeding. If either one
of these factors is properly represented in the petition, the Librarian may (not must) grant the petition, or can designate
the issue of whether a paper proceeding would be proper to the CARP. Section 251.41(b)(2) is only intended to allow
the Librarian to decide if a paper proceeding before a CARP would be appropriate; it is not designed to allow the Librarian
to decide the merits of a paper proceeding or the case. To clarify the intention of the rule, we are amending it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Conduct of hearings: Role of arbitrators. Section 251.46(b) provides that ``Only the arbitrators of a CARP, or
counsel as provided in this chapter, shall question witnesses.'' James Cannings argues that the rule, as drafted,
precludes parties from appearing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
before the CARPs, since only the CARPs and ``counsel'' can question witnesses. Cannings, comments at 2.

but only on issues affecting its particular interests, provided that the questioning is not repetitious or cumulative
of the questioning of other parties within the group.

Copyright Owners believe that, as currently drafted, the subsection ``seems to require that all parties with a similar
interest accede to a single counsel for examination or cross-examination of all witnesses. It is unlikely that parties
would agree to such a broad transfer.'' Copyright Owners, comments at 32. Copyright Owners therefore suggest that
the phrase ``of any given witness'' be added each time after the word ``cross-examination'' to clarify that agreements
between parties of similar interest to utilize one representative for questioning applies only to individual witnesses,
and not across the board for an entire proceeding.

parties with similar interest to agree to one representative for examining and cross-examining either one witness
or as many as the agreement allows. Nevertheless, in the interest of clarity, we are adopting Copyright Owners' suggested
amendment.

 In our discussion of &sect;251.49 in the Interim Regulations, we solicited comments on whether the hearing sessions
should be recorded on video as well as audio tape. We noted that videotaping would add to the cost of the proceeding,
but it would also:

Copyright Owners are opposed to the videotaping of proceedings, arguing that they ``do not believe that any advantage
derived from videotaping would be worth the considerable expense and difficulty associated with video recording.''
Copyright Owners, comments at 29. They also note that videotaping ``could, in fact, have the unintended and perverse
effect of increasing the number of hearing days missed by an arbitrator who considers seeing a taped performance as
equivalent to being present during the live presentation.''

(i) Settlement period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 251.63 provides a 30-day period before commencement of a rate adjustment proceeding to allow for consideration
of the rate adjustment petition and, more significantly, to give the parties an opportunity to settle their differences.
We are amending this section to make it clear that the Librarian shall designate this 30-day period prior to, and separate
from, the 45-day period for precontroversy discovery. We are also amending &sect;251.64 to reflect that the arbitration
proceedings will commence after both the 30-day period for settling rate differences, and the 45-day period for precontroversy
discovery.

 and Copyright Owners believe that in the case of a universal settlement a CARP would have no authority over a proceeding.
The Office would therefore be responsible for amending the rules, after a public notice-and-comment period, to reflect
the agreed upon rate. RIAA/AARC, comments at 8; Copyright Owners, reply comments at 6. RIAA argues that the CARPs'
authority is limited to controversies over royalty rates; if there is no controversy because there has been a settlement,
then there is no CARP authority. RIAA/AARC, comments at 8&hyph;9 [(citing our NPRM, 59 FR 2553 (1994)]. Copyright
Owners note that convening a CARP after settlement has been reached ``would make no sense'' and ``would subject the
owner/user participants to needless expense.'' Copyright Owners, reply comments at 6&hyph;7. A public notice-and-comment
period ``should provide the Librarian with an adequate record on which to determine whether to amend the regulations
consistent with the terms of the settlement.''

NMPA/HFA believes that the rules should provide the parties to a rate adjustment proceeding with the option of either
having a CARP convened, or submitting the agreed upon rate to a public notice-and-comment proceeding. NMPA/HFA,
comments at 2. NMPA/HFA believes that the statutory authority to provide such procedures ``can be fairly implied
from the Reform Act's direction that the Librarian adopt procedures and regulations relating to CARP proceedings
and the Reform Act's express grant of authority to the Librarian to make the final determination in rate adjustment
proceedings.''

We agree with Copyright Owners that it would make little sense to go through the time and expense of convening a CARP
solely for the purpose of approving a settlement agreement. Without deciding the issue of whether a CARP would have
jurisdiction in such cases, we are amending &sect;251.63 by adding a new subsection:

(b) In the case where a settlement is reached as to the appropriate royalty rate, the Librarian may, upon the request
of the settling parties, submit the agreed upon rate to the public in a notice-and-comment proceeding. The Librarian
may adopt the rate embodied in the proposed settlement without convening an arbitration panel, provided that no opposing
comment is received by the Librarian from a party with an intent to participate in a CARP proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Delivery of claims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are amending &sect;252.4(a) to adjust for some of the difficulties faced by the Copyright Office in receiving cable
royalty claims on a timely basis. Unlike the CRT, the Copyright Office and the Library of Congress are large institutions
receiving a tremendous amount of mail each day, only a small percentage of which involves CARP matters. For the July
1994 filing period, we experienced difficulties with cable and satellite claims arriving at different locations
of the Library by many different means of delivery (U.S. mail, messenger service, private mail carrier delivery).
In order to assure that claims arrive during the statutorily prescribed time period, we are amending &sect;252.4(a)
to specify the two methods by which claims may be delivered to the Copyright Office. The first method is by mailing the
claim to the official CARP address with the U.S. Postal Service, proper postage attached, so that when the claim arrives
at the Copyright Office, it bears a July U.S. postmark. The second method is hand delivery to the Office of the Register
of Copyrights, located in Room 403 of the James Madison Building, 101 Independence Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20540,
during normal business hours in the month of July. Such hand delivery may be done by the claimant itself, or by the claimant's
agent, or by a private delivery carrier (ex. Federal Express, DHL, messenger service) or other such manner. Hand delivery
of claims to the mail receiving area of the Library of Congress, or to other locations in either the Library or the Copyright
Office, is not compliance with the regulation. Claims which are hand delivered to other locations in the Library or
Copyright Office will be dismissed if the Office cannot conclusively determine that the claim was physically located
on Library and/or Copyright Office premises during the month of July.

We discussed in the Interim Regulations the Copyright Owners' request that we allow July mailings from Canadian and
Mexican post offices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 23979 (1994). We declined the request, but stated that ``we invite them [Copyright Owners], and any other interested
parties, to provide further information and comments on the question.''

 Our request for further information emanates from our concern with compliance with the statute. The statutory requirement
for filing cable claims is clearly spelled out in 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(4)(A): ``During the month of July in each year, every
person claiming to be entitled to compulsory license fees for secondary transmissions shall file a claim with the
Librarian of Congress &blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' The statute requires that the claim be with the Librarian during
the month of July, arguably meaning in his possession. However, we accept the submission of a claim to the U.S. Postal
Service, as statutorily sufficient, providing it bears a July U.S. postmark. The postmark is an acknowledgment that
the claim was validly tendered with the U.S. Government in the month of July. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our concern with allowing Canadian and Mexican postmarks is that those marks would not necessarily prove compliance
with the statute. Neither the Canadian nor the Mexican postal service is part of the U.S. Government. Furthermore,
if we were to allow Canadian and Mexican postmarks, we would have to allow national postmarks from all countries, since
there are some copyright owners of cable retransmitted programming that do not reside in the United States, Canada
or Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copyright Owners and Canadian Claimants' desire for allowing Canadian and Mexican postmarks appears to be motivated
by the desire ostensibly to add a few more days to the claim period. We, however, agree with what the Tribunal said in
1989 when it adopted the July U.S. postmark requirement:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Tribunal does not believe that our insistence that either a claim be received in our office during July or that it
bear a July U.S. postmark is too restrictive. The claim itself is easy to prepare. No government forms are necessary.
The information that is required can be put on one page. Further, the claimant has six months from the close of the calendar
year to prepare it, and the entire month of July to submit it to the Tribunal. Our proposed rule provides a bright line
test which should end all questions of fact regarding the timeliness of the claim.

Copyright Owners believe that this provision, as drafted, could cause some confusion. Copyright Owners, reply comments
at 8. They note that there are two receipts associated with certified mail_the one given the sender by the Post Office
and the one signed by the receptionist and returned to the sender_and that subsection (e) does not identify which receipt
is acceptable proof. Copyright Owners, however, state that our discussion of the provision in the Interim Regulations
makes it clear that either receipt would be acceptable.

Consistent with our decision concerning joint claims for cable and satellite carriers, &sect;259.3 is amended to
require that joint claimants to the DART fund include a list of all their joint claimants when the claim is filed, except,
as discussed above, the performing rights societies will receive no exemption from this requirement. Performing
rights societies will have to list the members and affiliates they have signed to represent in DART as part of their
filing a claim. As a result, the current &sect;259.3(d), which allows joint claimants to lump their claims together
after the claim period, and the current &sect;259.3(f) which provides that the Office may require the productions
of the list after the claim period ends, are deleted. As a practical matter, joint claimants who decide after the claim
period to join together will simply report to the Office that they have settled, and no need to consolidate their claim
exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we amend &sect;259.5(a) regarding timely delivery of claims and accept the Copyright Owners' proposed
amendment of &sect;259.5(e) regarding the proving of mailed DART claims through the use of certified mail return
receipt requested.

(i) The Librarian shall publish a list detailing the conflicts of interest the listed arbitrators have offered to
disclose, and any other matters which, although outside of the scope of the restrictions of &sect;251.31, nevertheless,
in the view of the Librarian, raise sufficient concerns to warrant disclosure to the affected parties;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If the objection is raised to a matter found to be outside the scope of &sect;251.31, the objection will be taken into
account when the Librarian makes his or her selection, but will not serve automatically to disqualify the arbitrator.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Copyright Office of the Library of Congress is waiving the rule that requires a performing rights organization
to have written authorization in order to represent its members and affiliates for 1993 and 1994 DART royalties in
the Musical Works Fund. At the same time we waive the rule, we seek comment on whether a performing rights society should
have separate, specific, written authorization from its members to collect DART royalties for its members or affiliates.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parties that import and distribute in the United States or manufacture and distribute in the United States any digital
audio recording technology (DART), either a device or audio recording medium, must deposit royalties with the Copyright
Office under the Audio Home Recording Act (AHRA) for ultimate distribution to interested copyright parties. The
AHRA defines ``interested copyright parties'' as copyright owners and any association or other organization representing
them. 17 U.S.C. 1001(7). If the parties do not reach distribution agreements among themselves, copyright arbitration
royalty panels (CARPs), administered by the Library of Congress and the Copyright Office, determine what joint or
individual claimants receive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to qualify, copyright owners must file a claim in January or February of each calendar year for royalties collected
during the preceding year. 17 U.S.C. 1006(a)(2), 1007(a)(1). The DART Funds are divided into the Sound Recordings
Fund and the Musical Works Fund. This interim rule deals only with the Musical Works Fund.

II. Representation by Performing Rights Organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Until it was abolished on December 17, 1993, the Copyright Royalty Tribunal (CRT) prescribed the ``form and manner''
for filing DART claims. Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103&hyph;198, 107 Stat. 2304
(eliminating former Chapter 8 of 17 U.S.C.). Shortly after the October 28, 1992, enactment of the AHRA, an issue arose
concerning the filing of claims to royalties. That issue was the extent of proof that performing rights organizations
were required to present in order to demonstrate proper representation of their members and affiliates. The CRT invited
public comment in an Advance Notice of Rulemaking. 57 FR 54542 (Nov. 19, 1992). On January 29, 1993, the CRT adopted
a rebuttable inference that performing rights organizations represented their respective members and affiliates
(hereafter ``members'') in royalty proceedings. 58 FR 6441, 6444 (Jan. 29, 1993). The interim regulations also directed
the parties to file a report, by June 1, 1993, on the issue. Subsequently, on October 18, 1993, the CRT published final
regulations requiring such organizations to submit separate, specific, and written authorization to represent
their members. Notice Adopting Final Regulations to Implement the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, 58 FR 53822 (Oct.
18, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 3, 1993, the performing rights organizations_the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers
(ASCAP), Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) and SESAC, Inc. (SESAC) (hereafter Performing Rights Organizations) filed
with the CRT a petition to reopen for reconsideration the rulemaking proceeding that resulted in the CRT's final rule.
On December 3, 1993, the CRT officially held the petition in abeyance. Order, dated Dec. 3, 1993,

 CRT Docket No. 92&hyph;3&hyph;DART. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 17, 1993, the President signed into law the Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 (CRT `Reform
Act'). Effective immediately upon enactment, the CRT Reform Act eliminated the CRT and transferred its responsibilities
to ad hoc CARPs. The new act directed the Librarian of Congress to convene CARPs to adjust rates and distribute royalties.
See 17 U.S.C. 111, 115, 116, 118, 119, and chapter 10.

Following Congress' direction in the CRT Reform Act, the Copyright Office issued a notice adopting the full text of
the former CRT's rules and regulations on an interim basis. 58 FR 67690 (Dec. 22, 1993). We made only slight technical
changes to those rules, stating that we intended to review and revise them during the course of a future rulemaking.

 We then published proposed regulations that revised the adopted CRT rules to adapt them to the requirements of the
new CARP system. 59 FR 2550 (Jan. 18, 1994). We concluded that we were not a successor agency of the CRT, and that Congress
intended to establish an entirely new system. Therefore, the proceedings the CRT had begun but not concluded by the
effective date of the CRT Reform Act would not be taken up where they had been left, but would rather be begun anew under
the new CARP regime.

On February 15, 1994, the Performing Rights Organizations filed a comment with the Copyright Office seeking to reconsider
the rule, now adopted by the Copyright Office, that required separate, specific, written authorization from Performing
Rights Organization members. (

III. Petition for Inference of Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In commenting on our adoption of the CRT rule, the Performing Rights Organizations assert that the rule disenfranchises
the many writers and publishers who would otherwise be qualified to receive DART royalties. Following the CRT's interim
rule, the performing rights societies contacted their members. One wrote to each of its members that unless the members
notified the organization to the contrary, the organization would represent its member writers and publishers.
Subsequently, when the CRT later required separate, specific, written authorization, the Performing Rights Organizations
again attempted to contact more than two hundred thousand writer and publisher members in less than four months. Performing
Rights Organizations states that they have agreements with the major foreign performing rights organizations to
represent foreign writers and publishers whose works are exploited in the United States. They also assert that since
not all eligible claimants responded to the writing, a significant number of members may still have the impression
that the Performing Rights Organizations are representing their claims and that the CRT's final rule effectively
leaves these members without an avenue to present their claims.

 Comment 4 at 4&hyph;8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Performing Rights Organizations also urge that even if the Copyright Office rejects the concept of a permanent
rebuttable inference, the rebuttable inference should extend through the 1993 DART distribution proceeding. Claims
for 1993 royalties were required to be filed during the months of January and February 1994. The Performing Rights
Organizations claim that even with the mass mailings following the Tribunal's final ruling, there was no practical
way to obtain all of the required signed written authorizations before the filing period expired. They also suggest
that the abolition of the CRT effectively disenfranchised the Performing Rights Organizations' members and affiliates,
since it eliminated their only forum for being reheard on this issue. The Performing Rights Organizations also contend
that further prejudice will result to their members and affiliates because of a private settlement, entered into
by all joint claimant groups and all but one of the individual claimants to the Musical Works Fund, that links distribution
of 1992 DART royalties, to which the rebuttable inference of agency applies, to the outcome of the 1993 proceedings,
to which the rebuttable presumption would not apply.

IV. Opposition for Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., oppose reconsideration of the issue. They believe the
matter has been amply briefed and settled by the CRT, and no new issues of fact or law have been raised. They oppose the
rebuttable presumption of agency and urge the Copyright Office not to disturb the final regulation. Reply Comment
10, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (94&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright Management, Inc., note that the CRT's rationale for granting a temporary
inference of agency is no longer applicable, since the time pressures have been greatly eased. Moreover, they state
that since the CRT specifically ruled in January 1993 that the AHRA did not grant Performing Rights Organizations
special entitlement to make claims on behalf of their members more than a year remained until the end of the filing period.
They contend this was ample time to obtain the required authorizations from members. Furthermore, they argue that
all organizations had the same opportunity to obtain written authorizations from their members. They state that
if the Copyright Office adopts the rebuttable inference in favor of the Performing Rights Organizations, it will
give these organizations a benefit over other group claimants. Moreover, the Gospel Music Coalition and Copyright
Management, Inc., claim that the silence of members should not be considered as implied consent to representation
by a performing rights society, and that excusing the performing rights societies from obtaining separate, specific,
written authorizations to file claims grants these organizations preferential treatment.

V. Policy Decision and Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Copyright Office has not considered this issue. Less than 30 days before the CRT Reform Act was enacted, the CRT
expressly ordered the Performing Rights Organizations' petition to reconsider to be held in abeyance. In our December
22 rule, we noted that we did not consider the Office to be a successor agency to the CRT. Therefore, matters pending
before the CRT would have to begin anew.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 9, 1994, we issued interim CARP regulations. At that time we noted that the Performing Rights Organizations'
comment serving as a petition to reopen was actually a petition for reconsideration of a pending CRT matter and that
we would consider it in a separate rulemaking proceeding. 59 FR 23964, 23966 (May 9, 1994). We are now addressing that
matter, and the Copyright Office requests comments on the issue of whether Performing Rights Organizations need
separate, specific, and written authorization to represent members and affiliates in collecting DART musical works
royalties. Any party who has already filed comments on this issue with the former CRT may simply incorporate those
comments by reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because we are reconsidering the rule, we are waiving the rule adopted at 37 CFR 259.2, and inferring an agency relationship
between the Performing Rights Organizations and their members for the 1993 and 1994 DART royalty distribution. This
rebuttable inference will be utilized solely for the purpose of filing claims for, and distribution of, 1993 and 1994
DART royalties payments. We include 1994 in the waiver of our rules because the parties have already sought and been
granted consolidation of 1993 and 1994 DART royalties. Therefore, it would be cumbersome to have different rules
for the consolidated proceeding. If a member files an individual claim or grants express authority to another agent,
such action will rebut the implied agency relationship. This action is without precedential value and shall not prejudice
the Copyright Office's ultimate determination of the issue.

 to provide the public with an opportunity to comment on USEPA's action. If a person submits adverse comments on USEPA's
proposed action within 30 days of publication of the proposed and direct final actions, USEPA will withdraw its direct
final action and will consider any comments received before taking final action on the State's submittal. Based on
the proposed full approval, USEPA is making an interim final determination by this action that the State has corrected
the deficiency for which a sanctions clock began on May 13, 1993. This action will defer the application of the offset
sanction and defer the application of the highway sanction. Although this action is effective upon publication,
USEPA will take comment. If no comments are received on USEPA's proposed approval of the State's submittal, the direct
final action published in this

rule taking into consideration any comments received.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 28, 1989 the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a revision to Wisconsin's SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP to USEPA, consisting of Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07, for which USEPA published a final disapproval on May 13,
1993 (58 FR 28362). The USEPA's disapproval action started an 18-month clock for the application of one sanction (followed
by a second sanction 6 months later) under section 179 of the Clean Air Act (Act) and a 24-month clock for promulgation
of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) under section 110(c) of the Act. The State subsequently submitted a revision
to its SIP for the Rhinelander, Wisconsin SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area on October 21, 1994. The USEPA has taken direct final action on this submittal pursuant to its modified
direct final policy set forth at 59 FR 24054 (May 10, 1994). In the rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 nonattainment area SIP. In addition, in the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

II. USEPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the proposed full approval set forth in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA believes that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the original disapproval deficiency that
started the sanctions clock and, therefore, USEPA is taking this interim final action finding that the State has corrected
the deficiency, effective on publication. This action does not stop the sanctions clock that started under section
179 for this area on May 13, 1993. However, this action will defer the application of the offset sanction and will defer
the application of the highway sanction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 39832 (August 4, 1994) to be codified at 40 CFR 52.31. If USEPA's direct final action fully approving the State's
submittal becomes effective, such action will permanently stop the sanctions clock and will permanently lift any
applied, stayed or deferred sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA is also providing the public with an opportunity to comment on this final action. If based on any comments
on this action and any comments on USEPA's proposed full approval of the State's submittal, USEPA determines that
the State's submittal is not fully approvable and this final action was inappropriate, USEPA will take further action
to disapprove the State's submittal and to find that the State has not corrected the original disapproval deficiency.
As appropriate, USEPA will also issue an interim final determination or a final determination that the deficiency
has not been corrected. In addition, the sanctions consequences described in the sanctions rule will also apply.

III. Administrative Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because USEPA has preliminarily determined that the State has an approvable plan, relief from sanctions should be
provided as quickly as possible. Therefore, USEPA is invoking the good cause exception under the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA) in not providing an opportunity for comment before this action takes effect.

 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The USEPA believes that notice-and-comment rulemaking before the effective date of this action
is impracticable and contrary to the public interest. The USEPA has reviewed the State's submittal and, through its
proposed and direct final action, is indicating that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the deficiency
that started the sanctions clock. Therefore, it is not in the public interest to initially impose sanctions or to keep
applied sanctions in place when the State has most likely done all that it can to correct the deficiency that triggered
the sanctions clock. Moreover, it would be impracticable to go through the notice-and-comment rulemaking on a finding
that the State has corrected the deficiency prior to the rulemaking approving the State's submittal. Therefore,
USEPA believes that it is necessary to use the interim final rulemaking process to temporarily stay or defer sanctions
while USEPA completes its rulemaking process on the approvability of the State's submittal. Moreover, with respect
to the effective date of this action, USEPA is invoking the good cause exception to the 30-day notice requirement of
the APA because the purpose of this action is to relieve a restriction. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS were monitored in Rhinelander, Wisconsin. On April 1, 1985 the State adopted Wisconsin State Rule NR 154.12(9),
which regulated certain sources of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 constructed before April 1, 1985 located within the corporate boundaries of Rhinelander, Wisconsin. The Rhinelander
Paper Company (source), a paper mill, was the only source affected by the State Rule's limits. These limits proved
ineffective to protect the NAAQS after three more exceedances which were attributable to the source were monitored
in 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1989 the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted a revision to Wisconsin's SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP to USEPA, consisting of Wisconsin State Rule NR 418.07, to satisfy the requirements of section 110 and part D of
the Act for the Rhinelander nonattainment area. The SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limits included in the State Rule are summarized in USEPA's January 5, 1993 (58 FR 326) notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPR). This rule was disapproved in final on May 13, 1993 (58 FR 28362), because the State had not shown that the rule
provided for attainment and maintenance of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. After the 1993 final action of disapproval, USEPA notified the State of the commencement of sanctions clocks
due to the disapproval. Further discussion is found within the August 30, 1994 Technical Support Document (TSD) from
Sheila Breen to Gary Gulezian, the November 10, 1994 addendum to the TSD from Christos Panos to Gary Gulezian, and the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latest SIP revision request dated October 21, 1994 includes Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, effective August
22, 1994 and two letters (August 29, 1994 letter from WDNR to the source and an October 19, 1994 letter from the source
to WDNR), which clarify certain items found in the Order such as storage of test samples and definitions. This 1994
SIP revision request was submitted to fulfill the requirements of section 110 and part D, and to cure the deficiency
that led to the notification regarding sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States are required to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan revisions
for submission to USEPA. The Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by a State must be adopted after
reasonable notice and public hearing. The USEPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore
warrants further USEPA review and action. The USEPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR
part 51, appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Wisconsin held a public hearing on September 13, 1994 to receive public comment on the implementation
plan for the Rhinelander SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area. Following the public hearing, the plan was adopted by the State and signed by the Governor's designee
and submitted to USEPA on October 21, 1994 as a proposed revision to the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by USEPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, and was found to be complete.
A letter dated November 8, 1994 was forwarded to the Director, WDNR, indicating the completeness of the submittal
and the next steps to be taken in the review process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP meeting all of the applicable Part D requirements for the Rhinelander nonattainment area. The following discusses
how the submission complies with the pertinent provisions of section 172(c), which sets forth the requirements for
Part D SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(1) In General_The plan complies with the requirements to implement reasonably available control
measures by providing for immediate attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS through the emission limits and operating restrictions imposed on the source by Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38.
By providing for immediate attainment, the plan also satisfies the requirements of section 192(b) that provide for
attainment by November 15, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(2) RFP_Reasonable further progress is achieved due to the immediate effect of the emission limits
and plantwide cap that is discussed within the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) Inventory_An inventory of the actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from the stoker and cyclone boilers has been provided and is found to be acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(5) Permits for New and Modified Major Stationary Sources_Any new or modified sources constructed
in the area must comply with a State submitted and Federally approved New Source Review program. The State currently
has an approved Federally delegated program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(6) Other Measures_The plan provides for immediate attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS through the emission limits and operating restrictions that are set forth within Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38.
By adhering to more stringent limits for the stoker boilers and presently setting an overall plantwide emission cap,
the area should continue to attain the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(7) Compliance with section 110(a)(2)_This submission complies with section 110(a)(2). With respect
to section 110(a)(2)(K), under which USEPA generally requires modeling in the case of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA notes that the Industrial Source Complex (ISC) model used by WDNR has been shown to underpredict ambient SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in the Rhinelander area, especially on known exceedance days. Therefore, as described in more detail
below, in this instance, an alternative methodology using the rollback analysis was needed and has been used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(8) Equivalent Techniques_Since modeling attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS is not achievable, an alternative methodology using the rollback analysis to set a plantwide emissions cap
was required. This is further discussed within the August 30, 1994 TSD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(9) Contingency Measures_A plan should be provided for the implementation of specific measures if
the area fails to make reasonable further progress (i.e., contingency measures), or to attain the primary NAAQS referenced
above. The State Implementation Plans; General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (General Preamble), which was proposed within the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992, provides guidance on SIP requirements for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas. The General Preamble discusses contingency measures for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 controls that fail to attain the NAAQS. Therefore, USEPA interprets ``contingency measures'' for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include the ability to rely on comprehensive State programs to identify sources of violations and to undertake
an aggressive follow-up program of compliance and enforcement. Wisconsin Administrative Code, State Rule NR 404.05(6)
dictates that the NAAQS may not be exceeded within the State of Wisconsin. Wisconsin State Rule NR 404.08(2) allows
the State to be more restrictive with emission limits than those prescribed within an implementation plan or air pollution
control rules where emissions cause or substantially contribute to exceeding an air standard in a localized area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA notes that through the issuance of Consent Order AM&hyph;94&hyph;38, the State has used these rules in context
of the Rhinelander area SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exceedances. These exceedances were determined to be the result of excess SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from the Rhinelander Paper Company. The USEPA believes that the existence of these state rules and WDNR's
program to implement them satisfies the requirements of section 172(c)(9).

(C). Review of Technical Merits of Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1). Emission Limits/Plantwide Cap: Due to ISC's apparent underprediction of ambient SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations, the State used the rollback analysis to determine appropriate emissions limits for the source.
A rollback analysis takes a monitored ambient exceedance recorded during a specific set of facility operating conditions
and determines the amount of the exceedance due to each of the source's SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emitting operations in use at that time. These estimates are then linearly ``rolled back'' to acceptable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission limits which provide for attainment of the NAAQS under that set of operating conditions (refer to 58 FR 326).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the exceedance, the source was operating its cyclone boiler and only two of its five stoker boilers. A
rollback analysis only accounts for those operations that were running at the time of the exceedance. However, the
source requires the flexibility of using multiple scenarios of boiler operations for economic reasons. Therefore,
the source accepted an overall daily SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission cap for the entire facility. This cap will assure protection of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS, while still allowing for operational flexibility. For further discussion on the rollback analysis, please
refer to the August 30, 1994 TSD.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

boilers, which requires additional sulfur testing of prior fuel if the current fuel is found to exceed 90 percent of
the enforceable SO

 emission limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3). Monitoring: The source has agreed to conduct meteorological monitoring. The State will conduct additional
ambient monitoring, which USEPA requested for additional background information on local conditions. The original
hillside ambient monitor that recorded the original violations will be maintained indefinitely. No recorded exceedances
have been monitored since the last SIP revision request was submitted to USEPA on April 28, 1989.

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This
action will become effective on Februray 6, 1995. However, if we receive a notice of intent to comment by January 6,
1995, USEPA will publish a document that withdraws this action, and will address the comments received in the final
rule on the requested SIP revision, which has been proposed for approval in the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

A. Applicability to Future SIP Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. The USEPA shall consider each request for a revision to the SIP in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order
12866 review.

C. Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify
that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include
small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act,
preparation of the regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness
of the State action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 6, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time
within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such a rule. This
action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (section 307(b)(2).)

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adjusts the renewal schedule of FM radio and television (LPTV) stations to correspond with the renewal
schedule of full service radio or television stations operating in the same state. The Commission also eliminates
FCC Form 348 and revises FCC Form 303&hyph;S to include information requrest formerly included in Form 348. These
actions are intended to decrease the administrative and paperwork burden on those licensees who own full service
stations and LPTV or translator stations in the same but who must, under the current rules, file separate renewal application
on different dates for each station.

Synopsis of the Report and Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission changes the license renewal dates of FM radio and television translator stations and low power television
(LPTV) stations licensed under Part 74 of the Commission's Rules, to coincide with those of full service radio or television
stations operating in the same state. The Commission also eliminates FCC Form 348, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for Renewal of a Low Power TV, TV Translator, or FM Translator Station License,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and revises FCC Form 303&hyph;S, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application for Renewal of License for Commercial and Noncommercial Educational AM, FM and TV Broadcast Stations,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include information requests formerly included in Form 348. These form revisions will permit translator stations
co-owned with primary stations in the same state which rebroadcast the signal of the primary station to file for license
renewal on a single application form with their primary station. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. The majority of parties commenting in response to the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Notice of Proposed Rule Making (MPRM)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 agreed with the Commission's initial view that conforming the renewal dates for full service and for FM and TV translators
and LPTV stations in the same state would streamline the license renewal process, eliminate paperwork burdens on
licensees and on the Commission, and simplify the renewal process for interested members of the public. By coordinating
the renewal cycles and merging the application forms, the Commission anticipates saving licensees who own both full
service stations and LPTV or translator stations in the same state, time spent in providing duplicate renewal information,
and avoiding confusion as to the correct renewal dates. These revisions should also save Commission staff resources
by reducing the likelihood of a licensee filing an application at the wrong time, which must then be returned by the
Commission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 noted that the transition to a revised renewal schedule would entail a one-time additional burden on cerain LPTV and
translator stations whose license come up for renewal before those of the full service stations in their state. More
particularly, it would result in some LPTV and translator stations receiving short term renewals in order to synchronize
their renewal cycles with those of full service stations in their states. In order to allow such stations to file for
renewal coincident with the renewal dates of full service stations in the same states, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 discussed alternatives that would would avoid this situation. The Commission rejected one option, to allow such
licensees to file for translator or LPTV renewal at their normal scheduled date, but with their next succeeding renewal
date set to correspond with those of full service stations in their state. This option was dismissed because some licenses
granted in this manner would run for a term beyond the maximum five or seven years (for TV and radio station licenses,
respectively) prescribed in Section 307(c) of the Communications Act.

4. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
NPRM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 suggested that, instead, such LPTV and translator stations could file for renewal twice during the transition period
to the new schedule, once at their normal renewal time (for a short term license) and again when the full service stations
in their states became due for renewal. This alternative would avoid conflict with Section 307(c), but concerned
some of the commenters because it would force some licensees to file for renewal in as short a period as eight months,
entailing additional administrative and cost burdens and providing additional opportunity for renewal challenges.
Such parties believe that the additional risks and burdens outweigh the benefits to be gained from allowing full service
station licensees to file full service, low power, and translator renewal applications at the same time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 The Commission believes that substantial savings to the Commission, broadcasters, and the public can be realized
by conforming the renewal dates for translator and low power television stations to those for full service stations
of the appropriate service (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 radio or television) in the same state. We expect these savings to include a streamlined renewal process, the elimination
of needless paperwork burdens and a reduction in the incidence of filing errors. Accordingly, we will grant translator
and LPTV applicants filing for license renewal a short term renewal with the license period extending only until the
end of the license period for full service stations of the relevant type located in the same state; at that time they
will have to file again for a full term license renewal. The Commission recognizes that this action will require two
renewal applications to be filed by some translator and low power licensees within a brief period of time. However,
this is a modest, one-time cost that is more than counterbalanced by the long term savings that will accrue from the
synchronization of renewal schedules and consolidation of forms that this action will achieve. Additionally, the
Commission believes that the fear expressed by some commenters that accelerated renewal filings will be subject
to increased renewal challenges appears to be one more of perception than substance. Only 3 challenges to LPTV station
renewals were filed during the last renewal cycle (1991&hyph;1994); two of those were subsequently withdrawn. In
the 1988&hyph;1991 renewal cycle fewer than six challenges were filed against translator applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Although, as discussed in detail in the full text of this decision, there does not appear to be any way to avoid the
above-described one-time additional short term renewal for translators and LPTV stations located in some states
without violating either Section 307(c) or 309 of the Communications Act of 1934 as amended (the Act), to alleviate
the extra burden on some licensees, pursuant to Section 8(d)(2) of the Act, the Commission will waive the application
fees for any translator or LPTV license renewal application that is required by this action to be filed within 26 months
of the station's most recent prior renewal filing. In situations where full service stations must file for renewal
prior to translator and LPTV stations in their state, the Commission will permit but not require the translator and
LPTV stations to file an early renewal to place them on the same renewal schedule as full service stations in their state.
The Commission strongly encourages translators and LPTV stations to file coincident with the corresponding full
service stations for that state. By doing so, translator stations commonly-owned with primary stations in the same
state which rebroadcast the signals of the primary station can realize the benefit of filing for renewal on a single
application form in the upcoming renewal cycle as opposed to waiting until the following cycle. Licensees of translator
and LPTV stations that do not elect to take advantage of this option will be required to file for license renewal at the
time presently required by their license authorization. In this latter case, shorter term renewals will be issued
for periods to expire coincident with the expiration date for full service station licenses in that state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In a related matter, one commenter, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) requests that the Commission,
in modifying FCC Form 303&hyph;S, include a certification that the applicant has complied with all relevant FM translator
rules, particularly those relating to funding and support. In amending the Form 303&hyph;S as a result of the instant
proceeding, the Commission will add to the form a certification related, but not identical, to that requested by NAB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605, it is certified that this decision will have an
one time negative impact on some small television and FM radio translators and low power television stations. As detailed
in the full text of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 low power television and FM radio and television translator licensees whose licenses expire before the renewal date
of their full service counterparts in the same state will have to file for renewal twice, once at their normal time and
once when the full service stations in their states are due for renewal. To alleviate this burden, the Commission will
waive the application fees for any translator or low power television license renewal application that is required
by this action to be filed within 26 months of the station's most recent prior renewal filing. The Commission believes
that the advantages of allowing FM and television translators and low power television licensees to file at the same
time as their full service counterparts in the same states outweigh the one time administrative burden necessary
to bring such stations into their full service counterparts' renewal cycle. The full text of the Commission's final
regulatory flexibility analysis may be found in paragraphs 11&hyph;13 of the text of the Commission's decision.

Section I_Fee Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
By law, the Commission is required to collect charges for certain of the regulatory services it provides to the public.
Generally, applicants seeking to renew the license for a commercial AM, FM, TV, FM translator, TV translator or Low
Power TV station are required to pay and submit a fee with the filing of FCC Form 303&hyph;S. However, governmental
entities, which include any possession, state, city, county, town, village, municipal organization or similar
political organization or subpart thereof controlled by publicly elected and/or duly appointed public officials
exercising sovereign direction and control over their respective communities or programs, are exempt from the payment
of this fee. Also exempted from this fee are licensees of noncommercial educational radio or television broadcast
stations. (This includes licensees of noncommercial educational FM and full service TV broadcast stations seeking
renewal of the licenses for their translator or low power TV stations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 those stations operate on a noncommercial educational basis. Low Power TV or TV translator stations that rebroadcast
the programming of a primary noncommercial educational station, but are not co-owned by the licensee of such a station,
are required to file fees. In addition, noncommercial FM translators operating on a non-reserved channel (CH 221&hyph;300),
and that are not co-owned by the licensee of the primary noncommercial educational station, are also required to file
fees.) Renewal applicants that earlier obtained either a fee refund because of an NTIA facilities grant for the stations
or a fee waiver because of demonstrated compliance with the eligibility and service requirements of 47 CFR 73.503
or 73.621, and that continue to operate those stations on a noncommercial basis, are similarly exempted from this
fee. See 47 CFR 1.1112. To avail itself of any fee exemption, the renewal applicant must indicate its eligibility by
checking the appropriate box in Question 2(B), Section I. FCC Form 303&hyph;S applications NOT involving the payment
of a fee can be hand-delivered or mailed to the FCC's Washington, D.C. offices. See 47 CFR 0.401(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Commission's fee collection program utilizes a U.S. Treasury lockbox bank for maximum efficiency of collection
and processing. All FCC Form 303&hyph;S applications, which require the remittance of a fee, must be submitted to
the appropriate post office box address. See 47 CFR 0.401(b). A listing of the required fee and the address to which
FCC Form 303&hyph;S should be mailed or otherwise delivered is also set forth in the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing
Guide'' which is obtained either by writing to the Commission's Form Distribution Center, 2803 52nd Avenue, Hyattsville,
Maryland 20871, or by calling Telephone No. (202) 418&hyph;FORM and leaving your request on the answering machine
provided for this purpose. See also 47 CFR 1.1104. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Payment of any required fee must be made by check, bank draft or money order payable to the Federal Communications Commission,
denominated in U.S. dollars, and drawn upon a U.S. financial institution. No postdated, altered or third-party checks
will be accepted. DO NOT SEND CASH. Checks dated six months or older will not be acceptable for filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Parties hand-delivering FCC Forms 303&hyph;S may receive dated receipt copies by presenting copies of the applications
to the acceptance clerk at the time of delivery. For mailed-in applications, a ``return copy'' of the application
can be furnished provided the applicant clearly identifies the ``return copy'' and attaches it to a stamped, self-addressed
envelope. Only one piece of paper per application will be stamped for receipt purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section must be completed and submitted by all applicants regardless of the service of the station for which renewal
is being sought. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 1. The name of the licensee applicant should be stated exactly as it appears on the station's existing license.
The current street address or post office box used by the applicant for receipt of Commission correspondence should
be set forth. If this information has been set forth in Question 1, Section I, it need not be repeated here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any change in the licensee's name, which does not involve a change in ownership requiring prior Commission approval,
can be communicated to the Commission by letter. To report any change in the mailing address previously used by the
licensee FCC Form 5072, entitled ``Change in Official Mailing Address for Broadcast Station,'' should be promptly
transmitted to the Commission. See 47 CFR 1.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 2. Applicants for AM, FM or TV stations should identify whether it has been licensed by the Commission as a
commercial or noncommercial educational licensee. A licensee that merely elects to operate its station on a noncommercial
basis is not considered to be a noncommercial educational licensee. The facility should be described by its service,
call letters, and specific community of license or area as listed on the station's existing license. See 47 CFR 74.1201(a),
74.701(a) and 74.701(f) for definition of an FM translator, TV translator and low power TV broadcast stations respectively.
For AM, FM or TV stations the location of the facility should be described in terms of the specific city or community
to which the station is licensed. Translator and Low Power TV stations should specify the area the stations are licensed
to serve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 3. This question must be completed by a radio or television renewal applicant seeking to continue its authority
to operate an FM Booster or TV booster station in conjunction with the primary station. The FM or TV booster station
should be described in terms of its call letters and the name of the specific community which it serves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Question 4. Aliens, foreign governments and corporations, and corporations of which less than 80% of the capital

licensee is directly or indirectly controlled by another corporation, of which any officer or more than 25% of the
directors are aliens or of which less than 75% of that corporation's stock is owned or voted by U.S. citizens, the Commission
must consider whether denial of renewal would serve the public interest. Licensees are expected to employ reasonable,
good faith methods to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their citizenship representations.

(d) A discussion of environmental and other considerations which led to the selection of the particular site and,
if relevant, the particular facility; the nature and extent of any unavoidable adverse environmental effects; and
any alternative sites of facilities which have been or might reasonably by considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information submitted in the EA shall be factual (not argumentative or conclusory) and concise with sufficient
detail to explain the environmental consequences and to enable the Commission, after an independent review of the
EA, to reach a determination concerning the proposal's environmental impact, if any. The EA shall deal specifically
with any feature of the site which has special environmental significant (e.g., wilderness area, wildlife preserve,
natural migratory paths for birds and other wildlife, and sites of historic, architectural or archaeological value).
In the case of historically, significant sites, it shall specify the effect of the facilities on any district, site,
building, structure or object listed in the National Register of Historic Places, 39 Fed. Reg. 6402 (February 19,
1974). It shall also detail any substantial change in the character of the land utilized (e.g., deforestation, water
diversion, wetland fill, or other extensive change of surface features). In the case of wilderness areas, wildlife
preserves, or other like areas, the statement shall discuss the effect of any continuing pattern of human intrusion
into the area (e.g., necessitated by the operation and maintenance of the facilities).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA shall also be accompanied with evidence of site approval which has been obtained from local or federal land use
authorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that such information is submitted in another part of the application, it need not be duplicated in the
EA, but adequate cross-reference to such information shall be supplied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An EA need not be submitted to the Commission if another agency of the Federal Government has assumed responsibility:
(a) for determining whether their facilities in question will have a significant effect on the quality of the human
environment and, (b) if it will affect the environment, for invoking the environmental impact statement process.

Section III_Question-By-Question Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The section must be completed and submitted only by applicants for AM, FM, or TV broadcast stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 1(a). Licensees of noncommercial educational and commercial radio and television broadcast stations
are required by Commission regulation (47 C.F.R. Section 73.2080) to afford equal employment opportunity to all
qualified persons and to refrain from discriminating in employment and related benefits on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin or sex. In conjunction therewith, every station with five or more full-time employees
must file an employment report on or before May 31 of each year, identifying the station's staff by gender, race, or
color and/or national origin in each of nine major job categories. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, all AM, FM, and TV stations must file an original and one copy of an Equal Employment Opportunity Report
(FCC From 396) with their renewal application. The EEO form is required of all such licensees even where they do not
employ five or more full-time employees or where there are less than 5% minorities in the labor force (however, in such
cases you need only complete the first 2 pages of the EEO form).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 1(b). Each noncommercial educational broadcast station licensee is required to submit a current and complete
ownership report (FCC Form 323&hyph;E) with its station's renewal application. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.361(d).
In such cases, the question should be answered affirmately. However, if the Form 323&hyph;E submitted with the station's
last renewal application is ``up-to-date'' and has been amended, a new ownership report need not be filed with the
current renewal application. The applicant should then answer the question negatively and supply the filing date
of that report and the call letters of the station for which it was submitted. An ``up-to-date'' Form 323-E ownership
report is one that is current for each question on that report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commercial broadcast station licensee is required to submit a current and complete ownership report (FCC Form 323)
once each year on the anniversary of the date that its license renewal application is required to be filed. See 47 C.F.R.
Section 73.3615(a). Licensees of multiple commercial broadcast stations with different renewal anniversary filing
dates may elect a single date to submit information, but the ownership reports may not be submitted more than one year
apart. If no charges have occurred, the licensee may submit a written certification to that fact, instead of filing
a new Form 323 each year. In addition, where the licensee is a partnership composed entirely of natural persons, the
annual reporting requirements does not apply. Similarly, sole proprietorships are exempt from the requirement
to file annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commercial broadcast station licensee that are not exempt from the annual reporting program are required to file
Form 323 SEPARATELY from their renewal applications. The annual ownership report (Form 323 or written certification),
accompanied by its requisite fee payment for each station covered by that report, should be sent to the U.S. Treasury
lockbox bank at the appropriate address and in the manner specified in the ``Mass Media Services Fee Filing Guide.''
Additional information regarding the submission of this report us set fort in the Commission's Public Notice of June
6, 1990, entitled ``Broadcast Annual Ownership Report.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 2. A licensee must maintain certain documents pertaining to its station in a file which is usually kept at
the station's main studio or other accessible place in the community of licensee. The file must be available for inspection
by anyone during regular business hours. The documents to be maintained generally include applications for a construction
permit and for licensee renewal, assignment or transfer of control; ownership and employment reports; and quarterly
lists of the community issues most significantly addressed by the station's programming during the preceding three
months. In addition, commercial television licensees only are required to maintain a make available to the public
certain records regarding children's programming and the amount of commercial matter aired during the station's
broadcast of children's programming. A complete listing of the required documents and their mandatory retention
periods is set forth in 47 C.F.R. Section 734.3526 and 73.3527.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 3. This question should be completed only by a commercial radio or television renewal applicant. Licensees
for these stations should not that anytime it finds it necessary to cease broadcasting it must notify the Commission's
Washington, D.C. office, by letter, not later than the 120th day of discontinued operation. Further, if a licensee
finds it necessary to cease broadcasting in excess of 30 days, it must, no later than the 30th day of the station being
silent, submit a letter request (no filing fee is required) to the Commission's Washington, D.C. office for temporary
authority to remain silent. The request must include the date the station ceased broadcasting; a detailed explanation
of the reason why it was necessary to take the station off the air; efforts being made to restore service; and the date
by which resumption of operation is anticipated. The request must also include a certification relating to Section
5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (See, as an example, Section V, Certification (1), of the Form). Extensions
of temporary authority to remain silent and must be timely requested if station operations do not resume within the
time given. Licensees must notify the Commission's Washington, D.C. office, by letter, once operations have resumed,
giving the date that operations resumed. See 47 C.F.R. Sections 73.1740 and 73.1750.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 4. This question should be completed by commercial TV applicants only. Programming directed to the educational
and information needs of children is an identifiable unit of program material that is not a comical or promotional
announcement, that is originally produced and broadcast for an audience of children 16 years of age and under, and
that furthers, the positive development of the child in any respect, including, but not limited to, the child's cognitive/intellectual
or emotional/social needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions 4(b) and (c). Commercial television licensees must limit the amount of commercial matter in ``children's
programming'', which is defined for this purpose as programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for
an audience of children 12 years of age and under. The children's programming commercial limitations are not more
than 12 minutes of commercial mater per hour on weekdays and no more than 10.5 minutes of commercials on weekends. The
commercial limits also apply 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to children's programs which are 5 minutes or more and which are not part of a longer block of children's programming.
There are no restrictions on how commercial within the limits are configured within an hour's block of children's
programming. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
it is not necessary to prorate the commercial limits for separate children's programs within the hour.

This section must be completed and submitted only by applicants for FM or TV translator or LPTV broadcast station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 1. An FM or TV translator or LPTV station is expected to provide continuous service except where cases beyond
its control warrant interruption. Where causes beyond the control of the licensee make it impossible to continue
operation, the station may discontinue operation for a period of 30 days without further authority from the FCC. However,
notification if the discontinuance must be sent to the FCC in Washington, D.C. no later than 10 days after the discontinued
operation. (See Section III, Question 3 of these Instructions for procedures for requesting temporary authority
to remain silent if the licensee finds it necessary to cease training for more than 30 days.) Failure to operate for
a period of 30 days of more, except for causes beyond the control of the licensee, shall be deemed evidence of discontinuation
of operation and the license of the translator or LPTV station may be canceled at the discretion of the FCC. See 47 C.F.R.
Sections 74.763 and 74.1263.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions 2 and 3. Section 325(a) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, prohibits the rebroadcast of the programs
of a broadcast station without the express authority of the originating station. Where the renewal applicant is not
the licensee of the originating station, written authority must be obtained prior to any rebroadcasting. Also, where
the licensee has changed the station being rebroadcast, written notification must be made to the Commission in accordance
with 47 C.F.R. Section 74.784 or 74.1251.

Question 4. This question should be answered by licensees of Low Power TV broadcast stations only. Licensees of Low
Power TV broadcast stations are required by 47 C.F.R. Section 73.2080 to afford equal employment opportunity to all
qualified persons and to refrain from discriminating in employment and related benefits on the basis of race, color,
religion, national origin or sex. In conjunction with these provisions, every station with five or or more full-time
employees must file an employment report on or before May 31 of each year, identifying the station's staff by gender,
race, color, and/or national origin in each of nine major job categories. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, LPTV stations must file an original and one copy of an Equal Employment Opportunity Report (FCC Form 396)
with their renewal application. This EEO form is required of all such licensees even where they do not employ five or
more full-time employees or where there are less than 5% minorities in the labor force (however, in such cases you need
only complete the first 2 pages of the EEO form).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 5(a). The provisions of 47 C.F.R. Section 74.1232(d) provide that an authorization for an FM translator
station whose coverage contour extends beyond the protected contour of the commercial primary station (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS is amending the regulations governing ``intermediary nation'' embargoes under the Marine Mammal Protection
Act (MMPA) by removing the regulatory definition of ``intermediary nation,'' which was inconsistent with a new statutory
definition and by incorporating the language of the statutory definition into the applicable regulatory text. This
amendment is necessary to bring the regulations into conformance with a recent amendment to the MMPA.

The MMPA requires the Secretary to prohibit the importation into the United States of any fish harvested with commercial
fishing technology that results in the incidental kill of ocean mammals in excess of U.S. standards. In the case of
yellowfin tuna harvested with purse seine nets in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, the MMPA prohibits the importation
directly from harvesting nations that do not have an affirmative finding from NMFS that they have a comparable marine
mammal protection program and mortality rate, as well as indirectly through intermediary nations. The MMPA defines
an ``intermediary nation'' as:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

a nation that exports yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products to the United States and that imports yellowfin tuna
or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a direct ban on importation into the United States pursuant to section
101(a)(2)(B). (Pub. L. 102&hyph;582, section 401(a)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;582, which added the definition of ``intermediary nation'' to the MMPA,
NMFS had promulgated a regulatory definition of the term in &sect;216.3. However, that regulatory definition does
not conform to the new statutory definition and, by this rule, is removed. The language of the statutory definition
is incorporated by this rule into the applicable regulatory text in &sect;216.24(e)(5)(xiv). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule relocates to &sect;216.24(e)(5)(xiv) provisions pertaining to reasonable certification
and proof, transhipments, and revocation of intermediary nation findings, which were contained in the definition
removed from &sect;216.3, but which still remain applicable.

This rule amends an existing regulation, without prescribing law or policy, in order to conform the definition of
an ``intermediary nation'' to that contained in a statutory enactment. The Assistant Administrator finds under
section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) that good cause exists to waive prior notice and opportunity
for public comment on this rule in that they would serve no useful purpose. Further, in that this rule merely incorporates
a statutory definition already in effect, good cause exists under section 553(d)(3) of the APA to waive the 30-day
delay in effectiveness.

 Any yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products in the classifications listed in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the intermediary nation has provided reasonable proof and has certified to the United States that it has not imported,
in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products that are subject to a ban on direct importation
into the United States under section 101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. A prohibition on imports under this paragraph may be
lifted by the Assistant Administrator upon a determination announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, based upon new information supplied by the government of the intermediary nation, that the nation has not imported,
in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products subject to a ban on direct imports under section
101(a)(2)(B) of the MMPA. Shipments of yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products through a nation on a through bill
of lading or in another manner that does not enter the shipments into that nation as an importation do not make that nation
an intermediary nation. The Assistant Administrator shall act on any request to review decisions under this paragraph
(e)(5)(xiv) that are accompanied by specific and detailed supporting information or documentation, within 30 days
of receipt of such request. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(5)(xiv), certification and reasonable proof means
the submission by a responsible government official from the nation of a document reflecting the nation's customs
records for the preceding 6 months, together with a certificate attesting that the document is accurate.

 The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management
Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The directed fishery for pollock in the BS by vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component was
closed on September 24, 1994, in order to reserve amounts anticipated to be needed for incidental catch in other fisheries
(59 FR 49032, September 26, 1994). NMFS has determined that as of November 12, 1994, 18,550 mt remain unharvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the allowance of the TAC of pollock allocated to the offshore
component in the BS has not been reached. Therefore, NMFS is terminating the previous closure and is opening directed
fishing for pollock in the BS for vessels catching pollock for processing by the offshore component effective at 12
noon, A.l.t., December 5, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other closures remain in full force and effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at &sect;675.20(h).

Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission resolves petitions for reconsideration or clarification of its competitive bidding rules for the
entrepreneurs' blocks, including provisions established to ensure that small businesses, rural telephone companies
and businesses owned by minorities and women (collectively termed ``designated entities'') have a meaningful opportunity
to participate in the provision of Personal Communications Services in the 2 GHz band (called ``broadband PCS'').
Among the issues the Commission re-examines in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
are matters concerning: the financial caps for entry into the entrepreneurs' block and qualification as a small business;
the equity requirements for the control group and other eligibility criteria; joint venture and consortia rules;
guidelines for defining

1. By this action, we resolve petitions for reconsideration or clarification of our rules governing competitive
bidding for ``entrepreneurs' block'' licenses in the 2 GHz band Personal Communications Service (``broadband PCS'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Twenty-six petitions were received, as well as 17 oppositions and 8 replies. Specifically, in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we resolve issues associated with our entrepreneurs' block rules, as well as other provisions we established to ensure
that small businesses, rural telephone companies and businesses owned by minorities and women (collectively termed
``designated entities'') have meaningful opportunities to participate in the provision of broadband PCS. Our goal
in this proceeding is to ensure that designated entities have the opportunity to obtain licenses at auction as well
as the opportunity to have meaningful involvement in the management and building of our nation's broadband PCS infrastructure.
Thus, as we describe below, we make certain modifications to our rules so that they will better serve these goals.

2. When the new broadband PCS auction rules were adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission declared its intent to meet fully the statutory objective set forth by Congress in Section 309(j) of
the Communications Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 309(j). In particular, we observed that it was the mandate of Congress that the Commission should ``ensure
that small businesses, rural telephone companies, and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are
given an opportunity to participate in the provision of spectrum-based services.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(4)(D). We also noted that Congress has directed us to ``promote economic opportunity and competition
and ensure that new and innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive
concentration of licenses and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). With these congressional directives in mind, we established the entrepreneurs' blocks
and designated entity provisions contained in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which are now under reconsideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Although we wish to ``fine-tune'' some aspects of our rules, we generally conclude that the ``entrepreneurs' block''
concept and the special provisions for designated entities adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are the most efficient and effective means to fulfill our statutory mandate to provide for a diverse and competitive
broadband PCS marketplace. In particular, we have adopted measures to ensure opportunities for meaningful participation
by minority and women-owned businesses in the emerging broadband PCS marketplace by providing that such entities
are eligible for bidding credits, installment payments, reduced up front payments and the benefits of tax certificates,
and by adopting eligibility rules that accommodate noncontrolling equity investment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On reconsideration of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we weigh the recommendations of those who have asked us to modify our rules. While we conclude that for the most part
our rules will remain unchanged, we find that some rule modifications are necessary to further empower businesses
owned by women and minorities and designated entities generally to participate in broadband PCS. Also, our rules
need to be clarified in some instances to provide entities wishing to participate in the entrepreneurs' blocks with
greater certainty and a better understanding of what is expected of them. Our rule changes will grant designated entities,
particularly minority and women-owned applicants, additional flexibility in how they raise capital and structure
their businesses. Minority-owned applicants, for example, should be able to draw more readily upon the financial
resources and expertise of other successful minority business enterprises. Our revised rules seek to accommodate
the many existing minority and women-owned firms that want to enter the PCS market, but whose existing corporate structures
do not meet the criteria for entry prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, experienced minority and women entrepreneurs, who are likely to succeed in the broadband PCS marketplace,
are not inadvertently barred from participating in the entrepreneurs' block under our new rules. In sum, our revised
rules permit entrepreneurs' block applicants to structure themselves in a way that better reflects the realities
of raising capital in today's markets, and to obtain the necessary management and technical expertise for their PCS
businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As we indicated above, a primary objective on reconsideration is to ensure that our rules promote diversity and
competition in the PCS marketplace of the future. In this regard, we believe a special effort must be made to enable
minority and women-owned enterprises to enter, compete and ultimately succeed in the broadband PCS market. These
designated entities face the most formidable barriers to entry, foremost of which is lack of access to capital. In
our effort to provide opportunities for minorities and women to participate in PCS via the auctions process, we strive
for a careful balance. On one hand, our rules must provide applicants with the flexibility they need to raise capital
and structure their businesses to compete once they win licenses. On the other hand, our rules must ensure that control
of the broadband PCS applicant, both as a practical and legal matter, as well as a meaningful measure of economic benefit,
remain with the designated entities our regulations are intended to benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. After reviewing the record, we amend or clarify our entrepreneurs' block rules in several respects.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 We emphasize that these changes constitute a refinement of our original entrepreneurs' block rules adopted in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that will further advance our objectives of promoting competition and diversity in the broadband PCS marketplace.

7. On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the Budget Act) added Section 309(j) to the Communications
Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 309(j). This section gives the Commission express authority to employ competitive
bidding procedures to select among mutually exclusive applicants for certain initial licenses. In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

awarded through competitive bidding and prescribed a broad menu of competitive bidding rules and procedures to be
used for all auctionable services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to conduct three separate auctions for broadband PCS licenses: the first for the 99 available broadband PCS licenses
in MTA blocks A and B; the second for the 986 broadband PCS licenses in BTA blocks C and F (the ``entrepreneurs' blocks'');
and, the third for the remaining 986 broadband PCS licenses in BTA blocks D and E.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
address auction methodology, application and payment procedures, and other regulatory safeguards. In addition,
we established the entrepreneurs' block licenses to insulate smaller applicants from bidding against very large,
well-financed entities. We also supplemented our entrepreneurs' block regulations with other special provisions
designed to offer meaningful opportunities for designated entity participation in broadband PCS. In particular,
we made bidding credits and installment payment options available to those entrepreneurs and designated entities
that, according to the record of this proceeding, have demonstrated historic difficulties accessing capital. Additionally,
we extended the benefits of our tax certificate policies to broadband PCS minority and women applicants to promote
participation by these designated entities in the service. We also adopted attribution rules that accommodate passive
equity investment in designated entities, but ensure that control of the applicant resides in the intended beneficiaries
of the special provisions. Furthermore, we reduced the upfront payment required of bidders in the entrepreneurs'
block. Finally, we established partitioning rules to allow rural telephone companies to expedite the availability
of offerings in rural areas.

FCC 94&hyph;178 at &para;37. When we crafted our broadband PCS licensing rules in Gen. Docket 90&hyph;314, we divided
the licensed broadband PCS spectrum into three 30 MHz blocks (A, B, and C) and three 10 MHz blocks (D, E, and F). We also
designated two different service areas: 493 Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) and 51 Major Trading Areas (MTAs). The 493
BTAs and 51 MTAs used in our broadband PCS licensing rules have been adapted from the Rand McNally 1992 Commercial Atlas

11. The Association of Independent Designated Entities (AIDE) contends that the Commission exceeded its statutory
authority in establishing the entrepreneurs' block because they potentially benefit entities that fall outside
of the four designated entity groups enumerated by Congress. AIDE maintains that the entrepreneurs' blocks reduce
meaningful opportunities for smaller designated entities to participate in PCS by forcing them to bid against ``entrepreneurs''
that may not qualify as designated entities. AIDE further argues that the Commission impermissibly restricted the
availability of financial incentives to designated entities for use only in Blocks C and F. Instead, AIDE requests
that the Commission make its financial incentives for designated entities available for every auctionable broadband
PCS license. The United States Interactive &amp; Microwave Television Association and the United States Independent
Personal Communication Association (USIMTA/USIPCA) (filing jointly) support the entrepreneurs' block concept,
but encourage the Commission to provide additional broadband PCS spectrum exclusively for designated entities.
Citing Congress' concern about the historical impediments that small, minority and women-owned businesses have
encountered, USIMTA/USIPCA maintain that ``it would not be unreasonable'' to set aside up to one-half of the available
PCS spectrum. Finally, GTE Service Corporation (GTE) requests the Commission eliminate the entrepreneurs' blocks
and instead allow designated entities to ``partner'' with major investors and be eligible for more generous bidding
credits. Additionally, GTE contends that our entrepreneurs' block scheme unduly restricts the ability of cellular
carriers to participate in the provision of PCS. Specifically, GTE contends that this scheme, combined with the PCS-cellular
cross-ownership restrictions, will effectively limit eligibility for many cellular operators to 20 MHz of spectrum
on the D and E blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Contrary to AIDE's contention, it is within our statutory authority to establish the entrepreneurs' blocks,
for which parties other than designated entities are eligible to apply for or invest in, and we believe that this scheme
will provide meaningful opportunities for designated entities to participate in the provision of broadband PCS.
Accordingly, we will retain the entrepreneurs' block structure set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing a competitive bidding process for the provision of spectrum-based services, Congress gave the Commission
broad authority to adopt bidding procedures and policies, so long as certain objectives are fulfilled. Specifically,
Congress mandated that the Commission ``promot[e] economic opportunity and competition and ensur[e] that new and
innovative technologies are readily accessible to the American people by avoiding excessive concentration of licenses
and by disseminating licenses among a wide variety of applicants, including small businesses, rural telephone companies,
and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
47 U.S.C. 309(j)(3)(B). Thus, the language of the statute allows us to consider other entities in order to ensure that
licenses are widely dispersed among a variety of licensees,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 so long as we also, among other statutory objectives, ensure that designated entities are given the opportunity to
participate in the provision of broadband PCS.

We believe the term ``including'' used in Section 309(j)(3)(B) of the Communications Act is a term of enlargement,
not limitation, intended to convey that other entities are includable together with, rather than excluded from the
categories of designated entities so long as legislative intent is satisfied.

13. The entrepreneurs' blocks approach adopted in our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
achieves the statute's objectives by creating significant opportunities for designated entities and other entrepreneurs
to ensure that licenses are widely disbursed to entities that can rapidly deploy broadband PCS services. We are making
additional changes to our rules (including eliminating the personal net worth cap and liberalizing our affiliation
rules for individual minority investors) to help designated entities overcome particularly intractable historic
difficulties in accessing capital. To satisfy Congress' directive, we established the entrepreneurs' blocks in
conjunction with a package of benefits that are narrowly tailored to provide significant opportunities to designated
entities and those entrepreneurs that lack access to capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. We disagree with USIMTA/USIPCA who requests that the Commission provide additional spectrum for entrepreneurs'
blocks. Our existing allotment, which comprises one-third of the total amount of licensed broadband PCS spectrum,
is sufficient to ensure that designated entities and other entrepreneurs have significant opportunities to participate
in the PCS marketplace. We therefore deny petitioners' various requests for modification to our entrepreneurs'
block provisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. We also reject AIDE's proposal to make bidding credits and other special provisions available to all designated
entities bidding on all of the broadband PCS frequency blocks (not just the C and F blocks). Our existing approach of
limiting these special provisions to the entrepreneurs' blocks, coupled with changes we are making today are narrowly
tailored to meet Congress' objective of ensuring that designated entities have the opportunity to participate in
broadband PCS. The record does not support broadening this relief to include additional frequency blocks, nor is
there substantial support for broadening the availability of special provisions generally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Similarly, we do not accept GTE's argument that we should do away with the entrepreneurs' blocks and instead offer
bidding credits as well as other special provisions across all broadband PCS frequency blocks. As we already explained
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in our judgment we do not anticipate designated entities to realize meaningful opportunities for participation
in broadband PCS unless we supplement bidding credits and other special provisions with a limitation on the size of
the entities designated entities will bid against. Without the insulation of the entrepreneurs' block, the record
strongly supports the conclusion that measures such as bidding credits will prove ineffective for broadband PCS.
We also disagree with GTE's contention that our entrepreneurs' block plan unduly restricts the ability of cellular
carriers to provide PCS. We believe that the public interest benefits of establishing an entrepreneurs' block outweigh
the need to provide additional opportunities for cellular operators as GTE describes. Moreover, our rules do allow
cellular operators such as GTE to take noncontrolling interests in designated entities and gain opportunities in
the entrepreneurs' block. We have recently revised the cellular-PCS crossownership rules to facilitate such opportunities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Commission established eligibility rules for the entrepreneurs' blocks based, in part, on an applicant's gross
revenues. To bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks, the applicant, its attributable investors (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, members of its control group and investors holding 25 percent or more of the applicant's total equity), and their
respective affiliates must cumulatively have gross revenues of less than $125 million in each of the last two years
and total assets of less than $500 million at the time the applicant files its Form 175 (``short form'' application).
We pointed out in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the $125 million gross revenues limit corresponds roughly to the Commission's definition of a ``Tier 2,'' or
medium-sized local exchange carrier (LEC) and would include virtually all of the independently-owned rural telephone
companies. Additionally, to qualify for the special provisions accorded small businesses, the applicant (including
attributable investors and affiliates), must cumulatively have less than $40 million in gross revenues averaged
over the last three years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. MasTec, Inc. (MasTec) argues that the Commission's gross revenues test is misleading when applied across the
board to all applicants because the gross revenues of investors operating in different industries will not convey
the same information about size or the ability to attract capital. The Telephone Electronics Corporation (TEC) notes
that the discontinuity between gross revenues and the ability to attract capital is particularly acute where the
entity in question is involved in a volume-intensive business with high operating costs and small profit margins
(such as TEC's interexchange resale carriers). Accordingly, TEC argues that the Commission's gross revenue criteria
are not rationally related to their stated purpose and should be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Several petitioners request that the Commission modify its gross revenues test, but disagree whether the limits
should be liberalized or made more restrictive. For example, MasTec encourages the Commission to modify its designated
entity criteria to include those minority businesses which are too small to compete outside of the entrepreneur blocks,
but too large to qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. The National Paging and Personal Communications Association
(NPPCA) and USIMTA/USIPCA urge the Commission to reduce the gross revenues cap. Specifically, NPPCA requests that
the Commission reduce the gross revenues limit to $75 million and the total assets limit to $250 million. NPPCA maintains
that these modifications are needed because the present size standards encourage mid-sized companies to refrain
from bidding in competitively unrestricted auctions and to compete, instead, against designated entities in the
entrepreneurs' block auctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. As an alternative to increasing the revenues cap, Omnipoint Communications, Inc. (Omnipoint) and the National
Association of Black Owned Broadcasters, Inc. (NABOB) argue that the ``aggregation rule,'' under which the Commission
will aggregate the gross revenues and total assets of the applicant, attributable investors and all affiliates in
order to determine whether the applicant complies with the financial caps, should be eliminated. Omnipoint contends
that a ``multiplier approach,'' employed in other areas of Commission practice, should be used to determine compliance
with the financial caps. Under this approach, the revenues and assets attributed to an applicant would be based on
the revenues and assets of each attributable investor, multiplied by the percentage ownership interest in the applicant
held by that investor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) requests that the Commission prescribe specific
dates for measuring the financial thresholds to determine entrepreneurs' block eligibility. Specifically, CTIA
requests clarification that gross revenues will be measured from the two years preceding September 23, 1993.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 CTIA maintains that our current rules, referring only to the ``last two calendar years,'' are ambiguous.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, states that ``[a]ny licensee *&blank;*&blank;* shall maintain its eligibility [for the entrepreneurs' blocks]
until at least five years from the date of initial license grant, except that increased gross revenues, increased
total assets or personal net worth due to non-attributable equity investments *&blank;*&blank;*, debt financing,
revenue from operations, business development or expanded service shall not be considered.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 24.709(a)(3). Petitioners ask us to clarify whether the following types of growth in assets, revenues, or personal
net worth would result in a licensee's forfeiture of eligibility: (1) Growth of applicant beyond the size limits by
means of mergers or takeovers; (2) any control group member's growth beyond the size limits by means of appreciation
of attributable investments or growth of attributable businesses; and (3) affiliates' or attributable investors'
growth beyond the size limits, by means of mergers or takeovers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

23. We will retain a single gross revenues size standard, which is an established method for determining size eligibility
for various kinds of federal programs that aid smaller businesses.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 We anticipate that applicants will, in many instances, have several investors and that these investors will be drawn
from various segments of the economy rather than from a single industry group such as telecommunications. The financial
characteristics of these industry groups will vary widely,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 and keying the size standard to each investor entity in question is thus administratively unworkable. A gross revenues
test is a clear measure for determining the size of a business, and will produce the most equitable result for entrepreneurs'
block applicants as a whole.

24. We will also retain the existing gross revenues and total assets limits for the entrepreneurs' blocks and for small
business size status. We find the arguments of those who oppose any reduction in the gross revenues limit most persuasive.
BET, for example, supports the balance it perceives the Commission has struck between small and mid-sized firms by
adopting a $125 million gross revenues test. We agree with BET that a decrease in the gross revenue limit would eliminate
many mid-sized firms from entrepreneurs' block participation while not substantially raising the level of competition
in the blocks. Conversely, an increase in the gross revenue limit would not necessarily provide for greater capital
access for applicants. We believe our $125 million gross revenues test represents an appropriate benchmark for entry
into the entrepreneurs' block, given our interest in including firms that, while not large in comparison to other
telecommunications companies, are likely to have the financial resources to compete against larger competitors
on the MTA blocks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. In addition, we will retain the aggregation methodology to assess the size of an applicant, with certain exceptions.
We reject NABOB's proposal to eliminate our aggregation rule and we cannot adopt Omnipoint's proposal to determine
entrepreneurs' block eligibility and small business size status by separately evaluating the assets and revenues
of each attributable investor. Aggregating the gross revenues and total assets of all attributable investors in
and affiliates of the applicant is central to an accurate size determination, and consistent with the Small Business
Administration's (SBA's) approach to similar determinations. Viewing gross revenues and assets of each investor
in isolation could result in very large entities bidding for these licenses. We reject Omnipoint's suggestion that
a multiplier approach be used to make these size determinations. A multiplier is appropriate to arrive at an accurate
determination of ownership interest in an applicant or licensee. In this context, however, we are not concerned with
ownership, but instead seek to make a financially-based size determination in order to assess whether an applicant
is eligible for significant governmental benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. We agree with CTIA that clarification is required concerning the two-year period in order to provide applicants
with a uniform way to measure gross revenues for purposes of qualifying for the entrepreneurs' blocks. For the initial
entrepreneurs' block auctions involving broadband PCS, companies should use audited financial statements for
each of the two calendar years ending December 31, 1993 or, if audited financial statements are not prepared on a calendar-year
basis, data from audited financial statements for their two most recently completed fiscal years. Therefore, if
applicants and their investors do not have audited statements ending on December 31, 1993, they will have to use one
annual statement ending at a later date (sometime in 1994). This approach will enable the Commission to obtain timely
financial data while providing applicants with some degree of flexibility in their financial reporting practices.
For subsequent entrepreneurs' block auctions (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 license reauctioning), we will require applicants to use their last two annual audited financial statements to determine
compliance with the financial caps. Newly-formed companies should use the audited financial statements of their
predecessors in interests, or financial statements current as of the time their Form 175 (short-form) application
is filed that are certified by the applicant as accurate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. Clarification is also needed with respect to the issue of growth and takeovers of an entrepreneurs' block licensee
or its investors. We clarify our rules to the extent necessary to indicate what types of growth will jeopardize an applicant's
continued eligibility as an entrepreneurs' block licensee during the holding period. A licensee could not maintain
its eligibility if a member of its control group were itself taken over, effecting a transfer of control of the licensee
during the license holding period. However, an attributable investor would not affect the licensee's continuing
eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block if another of the investor's affiliates grew or its investments appreciated
during the holding period. Our rules consider such growth either to be revenue from the investor's operations or to
be normal business development and, in either case, fully permissible. If an attributable investor is taken over
or purchased by another entity, the other entity steps into the shoes of the original investor and its assets and revenues
will be considered under the continued eligibility rule. However, if an affiliate of the applicant is taken over by
(or sold to) another entity, the other entity's assets and revenues would not be considered, so long as no new affiliation
arrangement between the applicant and the other entity is created by the takeover or sale. That is, in most cases, the
affiliation with the applicant would be severed by such a takeover and the gain from the sale of the affiliates' assets
would have already been taken into account by the initial consideration of such assets at the time of application.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 We emphasize that we have a strong interest in seeing entrepreneurs grow and succeed in the PCS marketplace. Thus,
normal projected growth of gross revenues and assets, or growth such as would occur as a result of a control group member's
attributable investments appreciating, or as a result of a licensee acquiring additional licenses would not generally
jeopardize continued eligibility as an entrepreneurs' block licensee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, for example, if Applicant A is affiliated with Corporation B and that corporation sells its business to Corporation
C, the income derived from the sale would not affect Applicant A's continued eligibility, unless a new affiliation
arrangement arises between Applicant A and Corporation C.

28. In addition to the gross revenues and assets caps, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also established a personal net worth limit to determine eligibility for bidding in the entrepreneurs' blocks. The
current rules require that persons that are applicants, attributable investors in the applicant and all of their
respective affiliates who are themselves individuals each have less than $100 million in personal net worth. Additionally,
the rules require that if the applicant seeks to qualify as a small business each individual in the control group, attributable
investors and all affiliates who are individuals, must have less than $40 million in personnel net worth. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 24.720.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. BET requests the Commission relax the personal net worth limits applicable to attributable investors in minority-owned
firms. BET argues that eliminating the personal net worth standard would help ensure participation by minority and
women-owned businesses by allowing successful individuals to bring their experience to bear in the PCS marketplace.
At the same time, BET argues that this measure would ensure that relatively small, minority and women-owned enterprises
have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the provision of PCS. TEC also requests the Commission liberalize
its personal net worth standard to permit an attributable individual investor to hold up to $125 million in personal
net worth. MasTec claims that net worth/net revenue definitions are overly restrictive and will exclude those minority
businesses that can best survive and succeed in the competitive PCS market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. We will eliminate the personal net worth limits (both for the entrepreneurs' blocks and for small business size
status) for all applicants, attributable investors, and affiliates. The obstacles faced by minorities and minority-controlled
businesses in raising capital are well-documented in this proceeding and are not necessarily confined to minorities
with limited personal net worth. Therefore, we agree with the view that the personal net worth requirements should
be eliminated in the case of minority-controlled applicants seeking to qualify for entrepreneurs' block licenses.
However, rather than eliminate the personal net worth limits for minorities only, we will eliminate the requirement
for all applicants because personal net worth limits are difficult to apply and enforce and may be easily manipulated.
We do not believe that eliminating the personal net worth limits will facilitate significant encroachment by ``deep
pockets'' that can be accessed by wealthy individuals through affiliated entities because, in those instances where
access to such resources would create an unfair advantage, the affiliation rules will continue to apply and require
that such an entity's assets and revenues be included in determining an applicant's size. Thus, we emphasize that
we believe the affiliation rules make the personal net worth rules largely unnecessary since most wealthy individuals
are likely to have their wealth closely tied to ownership of another business.

31. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sets forth specific affiliation rules for identifying all individuals and entities whose gross revenues and assets
must be aggregated with those of the applicant in determining whether the applicant exceeds the financial caps for
the entrepreneurs' blocks (or for small business size status). The affiliation rules were adapted from those used
by the SBA for purposes of assessing size status and consequent eligibility to participate in SBA's loan, procurement
and minority enterprise programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. Specifically, our rules identify which individuals or entities will be found to control or be controlled by the
applicant or an attributable investor by specifying which ownership interests or other criteria will give rise to
a finding of control and consequent affiliation. In the August 15, 1994

33. BET and others argue that we did not provide adequate notice or opportunity to comment on the possibility of the
Commission adopting affiliation rules for all entrepreneurs' block participants (specifically, minorities and
women). BET argues that we have thus violated the notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA), and that the Commission is required to issue a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Further Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prior to adopting the affiliation rules. BET also contends that the affiliation rules add unnecessary complexity
to the broadband auction rules and that they make it very difficult, if not impossible, for potential bidders to tailor
their pre-existing business relationships and ownership structures to our eligibility requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. Several parties have filed petitions for reconsideration of our Order on Reconsideration. On reconsideration
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 several petitioners also challenge the limited exemption granted to Indian tribes or request that generic exemptions
be granted for other applicants. BET and MasTec oppose any special treatment for a particular minority group, arguing
that the exemption accorded Indian tribes creates an imbalance of bidding power in favor of tribally-owned entities
and will skew the broadband PCS auction results. Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (Cook Inlet) argues that the exemption for
Indian tribes should be expanded to encompass eligibility for treatment as a small business for purposes of bidding
credits and installment payments because: (1) Indian tribes are congressionally recognized as particularly disadvantaged;
(2) such an exemption applies when determining size status for SBA's programs; and, (3) substantial legal constraints
with respect to tribal property and businesses preclude their use to raise capital or to cross-subsidize other tribally-owned
entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. More specifically, Cook Inlet assets that Indian tribes and Native corporations deserve special treatment because
they face legal constraints that differ from other minority-owned businesses. According to Cook Inlet, Federal
law prohibits Native corporations from pledging their stock as collateral for loans, issuing new stock to raise funds
in traditional capital markets, or utilizing the majority of the revenues from their land holdings to invest in new
enterprises. Thus, Cook Inlet contends that Indian tribes and Native corporations should be exempt from both the
affiliation rules and the small business test because Native corporations cannot utilize their assets or revenues
to fund new business ventures in the same way other corporations can. In reply, BET asserts that Alaska Regional Corporations
still enjoy significantly greater access to capital than other minority-owned entities participating in the bidding
for the entrepreneurs' block licenses despite any restrictions they might have on their assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. TEC seeks an exemption from the affiliation rules for rural telephone companies, arguing that regulatory and
corporate barriers prohibit small telephone companies like TEC from shifting broadband PCS costs to their affiliated
resellers and that courts have found questions of affiliation to be irrelevant where such barriers to cross-subsidization
exist. MEANS/SDN suggests a more narrowly tailored exception that would exempt centralized equal access providers
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a consortia of rural telephone companies that provide centralized equal access and other sophisticated information
services) from the Commission's affiliation rules. MEANS/SDN argues that this modification would allow the consortia
to bring their considerable expertise and efficiencies to bear in the deployment of broadband PCS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. After considering petitioners' various concerns, we will not eliminate the affiliation rules. As explained
fully below, however, we create a limited exception to our affiliation rules that will apply when an attributable
minority investor or enterprise in an applicant or an applicant's control group has controlling interests in other
concerns. We also revise our treatment of Indian tribes under our affiliation rules to more narrowly tailor our application
of these rules to the unique status of these minority groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. As an initial matter we do not believe the promulgation of the affiliation rules violated the notice and comment
requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. Our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this docket
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 alerted petitioners to the fact that the Commission was considering SBA's size standards which, by their terms (as
set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), incorporate the concept of affiliation in determining a firm's small business size status.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 The question of affiliation is integral to the concept of size status, by whatever means size status is assessed. Without
affiliation rules, large firms may unfairly avail themselves of the preferences intended for small businesses and
other designated entities since they have an incentive to create subsidiaries (that would have access to the parent's
substantial resources) to compete against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicants in the entrepreneurs' blocks. Adoption of affiliation rules similar to those used by the SBA is a logical
outgrowth of the Commission's decision to impose a gross revenues test for small businesses and to consider SBA's
size standards in establishing that test.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 It was reasonable for petitioners to conclude that such rules would be applied in assessing eligibility for the entrepreneurs'
blocks and for small business size status. Thus, sufficient opportunity to comment was provided on the affiliation
rules since they play an integral role in any determination of size status. Moreover, we see no advantage in seeking
additional comment on the affiliation rules since petitioners, such as BET, had a full and fair opportunity to suggest
modifications to our affiliation rules, some of which we adopt on reconsideration. A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
39. Furthermore, we decline to adopt the suggestion that we eliminate the affiliation rules on the grounds that these
rules are unduly complex or overburdensome. Affiliation rules are an established and essential element in determining
an applicant's compliance with a gross revenues (or other) size standard. Their use ensures that all financial and
other resources available to a company will be considered in assessing its size status. The Commission's affiliation
rules, in conjunction with its attribution rules, are intended to include in this calculation: (1) All individuals
and entities that directly or indirectly control the applicant, any member of its control group, or any other investor
having an attributable interest in the applicant; (2) any other entities also controlled by such individual or entity;
(3) all entities over which the applicant has direct control or indirect control through an intermediary; and (4)
all other entities over which a member of its control group or any other attributable investor has direct or indirect
control. Elimination of the affiliation rules would result in an underassessment of an applicant's size and would
present an unrealistic picture of the applicant's need for bidding credits, installment payments and reduced up
front payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. We are persuaded, however, that a limited exception to our affiliation rules is appropriate for minority-owned
applicants and applicants owned by a combination of minorities and women. The exception will apply to affiliates
controlled by investors who are members of minority groups who are attributable members of an applicant's control
group. Under the exception, the gross revenues and assets of affiliates that the minority investor controls will
not be counted in determining the applicant's compliance with the financial caps, both for purposes of the entry into
the entrepreneurs' block and for purposes of the applicant qualifying as a small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. This exception will permit minority investors that control other concerns to be members of an applicant's control
group and to bring their management skills and financial resources to bear in its operation without the assets and
revenues of those other concerns being counted as part of the applicant's total assets and revenues. By making such
an exception, we further our goal of addressing traditional problems minorities have of accessing capital. As we
documented in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report &amp; Order,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 minorities have faced and continue to face unique barriers to capital from traditional, non-minority sources. To
raise capital for a new business venture, therefore, minorities need the ability to draw upon the financial strength
and business experience of successful minorities and minority-owned businesses within their own communities;
they may not have access to any other source of funds on which to draw. Moreover, this exception permits minority applicants
to pool their resources with other minority-owned businesses and draw on the expertise of those who have faced similar
barriers to raising capital in the past.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 We therefore conclude that further tailoring of our affiliation rules to the specific capital formation problems
of minorities is necessary to avoid eliminating a traditional source of capital for minority businesses_the minority
community itself. We note that this exception applies only to affiliates controlled by minority investors in the
applicant or members of the applicant's control group. The exception does not apply to affiliates of such investors
or businesses that control the applicant or that have an attributable interest in the applicant. Thus, a minority-owned
firm that exceeds the financial caps would not be able to create a subsidiary to participate in a PCS applicant's control
group.

For example, if M, an attributable minority investor in the applicant, controls Corporation C with assets of $500
million, but Corporation C does not control applicant A and is not an attributable investor in Applicant A, the assets
and revenues of Corporation C will not be counted in assessing A's compliance with the financial caps for either the
entrepreneurs' blocks or small business size status. On the other hand, if M Corporation, a minority-owned company
with an attributable interest in Applicant A, is controlled by Corporation C in the above example, or is under common
control with Corporation C, the assets and revenues of M Corporation's affiliates are attributable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order on Reconsideration,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we treat Indian tribes differently under our affiliation rules for purposes of our entrepreneurs' block financial
caps because of their unique legal status. Specifically, we exclude the gross revenues and total assets of Indian
tribes in our calculations for purposes of determining whether an affiliated applicant satisfies our entrepreneurs'
block financial caps. After considering the arguments of petitioners, we also will exclude generally the revenues
of Indian tribes in our calculations for purposes of determining small business eligibility.

43. In response to MasTec's and BET's concerns about special treatment for a particular minority group, we clarify
that we exempt Indian tribes generally from our affiliation rules because Congress has imposed unique legal constraints
on the way they can utilize their revenues and assets. Cook Inlet contends that, while other minority-owned businesses
can issue debt and equity securities and pledge their assets and securities to raise capital, the real and personal
property interests held by Alaska Native Corporations are subject to a number of constraints_both legal and cultural_that
affect their ability to manage and dispose of property. For example, under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act,
43 U.S.C. 1601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the stock held by Native corporations is subject to strict alienability restrictions_it cannot be sold, pledged,
mortgaged, or otherwise encumbered. Thus, Native corporations are precluded from two of the most important means
of raising capital enjoyed by virtually every other corporation: (1) The ability to pledge stock of the company against
ordinary borrowings, and (2) the ability to issue new stock or debt securities. In addition, assets held by Indian
tribes include land holdings that cannot be used as collateral for purposes of raising capital, because the land holdings
are owned in trust by the federal government or are subject to a restraint on alienation in the government's favor.
Congress has not placed similar legal constraints on the assets and revenues of enterprises owned by any other minority
group. We agree with Cook Inlet that such legal restraints on assets and revenues place Indian tribes at a disadvantage
vis-a-vis other minority groups with similar revenues and assets. Finally, as we noted in our 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Order on Reconsideration,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Congress has mandated that the SBA determine the size of a business concern owned by a Tribe without regard to the concern's
affiliation with the Indian tribe. Our policy mirrors this congressional mandate.

44. After considering the record, however, we have determined that gaming revenues generally are not subject to the
same types of legal restrictions as other revenues received by Indian tribes. Therefore, we establish a rebuttable
presumption that revenues derived from gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will be included in our calculations when determining whether an applicant that is affiliated with an Indian tribe
qualifies for the entrepreneurs' block or as a small business. Cook Inlet has set forth several reasons why we should
treat gaming revenues differently from other types of Indian tribe revenues. First, Cook Inlet argues that these
revenues were not part of the tribal economic picture when Congress enacted the SBA tribal exception to the affiliation
rule in 1970. Second, Cook Inlet contends that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides certain Indian tribes with
a non-traditional source of revenue that could be very substantial. Cook Inlet also asserts that gaming revenues
are not subject to the same types of legal and governmental controls as other revenues received by Indian tribes, and
therefore are more analogous to the revenues of non-Indian entities. Furthermore, Congress granted the SBA (whose
rules inspired our affiliation rules) flexibility to treat tribal and other affiliations with exceptional revenues
differently if such revenues would create an ``unfair competitive advantage.''
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Gaming revenues generated by tribal organizations, appear to be exceptional revenues that if not included, create
an unfair competitive advantage in the auctioning of broadband PCS entrepreneurs' block licenses. Thus, we will
include such gaming revenues in our calculations when determining eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block and
for small business status, unless the entrepreneurs' block applicant establishes that it will not receive an unfair
competitive advantage, because significant legal constraints restrict its ability (or an affiliate's ability)
to access and utilize revenues from gaming.

45. Finally, we decline to create an exception to our affiliation rules for rural telephone companies. We are concerned
that relaxing our rules would unfairly match large rural telephone companies, with greater access to capital, against
entrepreneurs and designated entities (including small and medium-sized rural telephone companies). We note in
this regard, that rural telephone companies already enjoy substantial regulatory benefits (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
access to Rural Electrification Administration loans) affecting available capital in comparison to other designated
entities. Moreover, we observe that rural telephone companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned licenses
at any time after the close of auctions. We believe that existing measures will thereby achieve our goal of facilitating
the rapid deployment of PCS to rural areas. At MEANS/SDN's request, however, we clarify that a centralized equal access
provider (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a group of rural telephone companies that provide centralized equal access and other sophisticated information
services)
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 will not be deemed an affiliate of each of its constituent members. Based on the record, it does not appear that such
entities control their constituent members or that each of the members control the centralized equal access providers.
Thus, for example, if two or more of MEANS' members form a consortium of small businesses that apply for the entrepreneurs'
blocks, MEANS itself would not be attributed to each one of the small businesses. We agree with MEANS that this clarification
will contribute to the efficient deployment of broadband PCS in rural areas.

47. Karl Brothers requests that the Commission amend its definition of ``members of minority groups'' to include
businesses owned by individuals with disabilities. Specifically, Karl Brothers suggest the Commission adopt the
standard established in the SBA Section 8(a) program to determine who should qualify for designated entity status.
According to Karl Brothers, this SBA program includes businesses owned by disabled individuals under a ``means''
and ``socially disadvantaged'' test. Karl Brothers maintains that the congressional mandate to give special preference
to minority groups is not limited to just ethnic minorities, but should include other historically disadvantaged
minorities. Karl Brothers maintains that Congress was merely giving examples of groups to be included in the definition
of minorities, not limiting the definition to ethnic groups only. Karl Brothers contends that there is no statutory
language excluding other disadvantaged groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
48. After considering Karl Brothers' request, we will not include persons with disabilities in the definition of
minorities for purposes of bidding on the entrepreneurs' blocks and obtaining the special provisions available
to minority applicants. The record in this proceeding does not contain any evidence that demonstrates that firms
owned by persons with disabilities have more difficulty accessing capital than any other small business. In this
respect, the record of this proceeding on the difficulties that minorities, women and small businesses, in general,
have experienced accessing capital strongly supports the special provisions we adopted for these groups. Moreover,
individuals with disabilities are not expressly named as a designated entity in Section 309(j)(4)(D) of the Communications
Act, and there is no indication in the legislative record of the statute that Congress intended to expand this group
of beneficiaries to include any group or individual that can demonstrate that it is ``socially disadvantaged'' similar
to the SBA Section 8(a) approach described by the Karl Brothers. Unlike the Small Business Act, Section 309(j)(4)(D)
of the Communications Act does not contain the term ``socially disadvantaged.''

8(a) status for minority groups (which are defined in racial and ethnic terms), but firms owned by persons with disabilities
must demonstrate that they are ``socially disadvantaged'' in order to gain entry into the program. Also, the SBA's
denial of Section 8(a) status for firms owned by persons with disabilities where such ``social disadvantage'' has
not been established, has been upheld in court.

49. Additionally, there is no indication that in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(D) Congress intended to expand the definition
of ``members of minority groups'' to include classes of persons other than racial or ethnic groups, such as those listed
in the preceding subsection, Section 309(i).
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 We further observe that in no other Commission context, have we included disabled persons in the categories of groups
that comprise our definition of minorities. Making such a change here, without clear statutory and legislative support
to do so, would therefore be inconsistent with our traditional application of the definition, which we believe should
be uniform in all licensing contexts.

50. We wish to emphasized also, that it is highly likely that most firms owned by individuals with disabilities will
be eligible to bid in the entrepreneurs' block and for an installment payment option if they meet the required gross
revenues and total assets test. Such firms may also be eligible for ``enhanced'' installment payments and bidding
credits if they qualify as small businesses under our rules. Indeed, absent a substantial record that demonstrates
firms owned by persons with disabilities have any more difficulty accessing capital then any other small business,
we find that we cannot accommodate the Karl Brothers request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
51. We also note that we have before us a Petition for Rulemaking filed by David J. Lieto (Lieto Petition), which requests
that the Commission amend Section 1.2110 of the Commission's rules to provide that disabled individuals are within
the minority group categories and are thus entitled to the benefits associated with being a designated entity under
the Commission's auction rules.

David J. Lieto Petition for Rulemaking, filed September 21, 1994, at 2&hyph;3. As stated above, we believe that our
existing rules provide opportunities for individuals with disabilities to participate in the entrepreneurs' block,
and that there is no direct statutory or record support for Lieto's request. Furthermore, Lieto has failed to provide
a record comparable to that for women and minorities demonstrating that disabled individuals experience difficulties
accessing capital that are unique to their status. Accordingly, we decline to initiate a rulemaking at this time,

Small Business Consortia

53. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission allowed a consortium of small businesses to qualify collectively for the preferences available to
a small business if each business within the consortium individually satisfies the definition of a small business
designated entity. The Commission defined a small business designated entity as any company that, together with
attributable investors and affiliates, has average gross revenues for the three preceding years of not in excess
of $40 million. We defined ``consortium of small businesses'' as a conglomerate organization formed as a joint venture
among mutually-independent business firms, each of which individually satisfies the definition of a small business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, we concluded that consortia should not always be entitled to qualify for measures designed specifically for designated
entities. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, we stated that for the auctioning of broadband PCS, it is especially necessary to allow small businesses
to pool their resources in this manner to help them overcome capital formation problems. Thus, our rules provide that
if a consortium's members are all small businesses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, defined as companies that do not have average yearly gross revenues for the preceding three years in excess of $40
million), the consortium as a whole will qualify for designated entity provisions for small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
54. Omnipoint requests that the Commission allow small businesses to form a single corporate applicant (rather than
a joint venture) and get the same treatment as consortia. BET requests that the Commission eliminate the preference
available to small business consortia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55. We believe the current preferences for small business consortia are adequate and necessary to ensure that small
businesses have sufficient opportunities to participate in the broadband PCS auctions. Accordingly, we deny BET's
request to eliminate the small business consortia preferences. As we observed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, allowing small businesses to pool their resources in this manner is necessary to help them overcome capital formation
problems and ensure their participation in the provision of broadband PCS. We believe that small, rural telephone
companies, in particular, are expected to use this mechanism to compete in some of the smaller markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
56. We also deny Omnipoint's request that small businesses be allowed to form a single corporate applicant that would
be afforded the same treatment as consortia. The concept of a consortium is that each small business participant remains
a distinct corporate entity independent of other consortium members and that each member has rights and obligations
similar, or equal to, those held by participants in other types of joint ventures. Allowing a group of small businesses
to apply as one corporate applicant and receive the benefits or our consortia rule would disadvantage small, independent
businesses wishing to bid as a group under our rule, but who cannot restructure as a corporate applicant and could tend
to dilute each member's influence and insulate their responsibilities in the venture. We believe that such a change
would also eviscerate our small business eligibility size requirement. We wish to clarify, however, that we intent
to examine the qualifications of each consortium member to ensure that each is a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 small business. In this regard, it is assumed that each concern should be an entity ``organized for profit'' and not
for the sole purpose of qualifying as part of a small business consortia. This is consistent with SBA's long-standing
definition of ``business concern.''

57. On another issue, BET contends that the $40 million gross revenues standard fails to comply with an SBA requirement
that any size standard proposed by a federal agency that varies from SBA's standard be ``proposed after an opportunity
for public notice and comment'' and be ``approved by the Administrator [of the SBA].''
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 We believe we have fully met our notice and comment obligations, both under the Administrative Procedures Act and
the Small Business Act, in this proceeding. We solicited comment on a range of size options, and received comment that
included SBA's recommendation for a $40 million gross revenues cap (which we ultimately adopted). Indeed, we recently
obtained SBA's approval of the $40 million size standard.

Minimum Equity Limit for the Control Group
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission adopted a methodology for assessing an applicant's compliance with the financial caps for the entrepreneurs'
blocks and for small business size status based on the distinction between: (a) Noncontrolling investors (whose
financial status would not be attributed to the applicant); and (b) investors holding interests in the control group
of the applicant. The gross revenues, assets and personal net worth limits of attributable investors (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those with more than 25 percent equity) and all control group members, regardless of the size of their individual interests,
are included in assessing an applicant's compliance with the financial caps. To qualify as a women or minority-owned
business, the Commission further required that the control group be composed entirely of women and minorities. The
control group requirement ensures that designated entity and entrepreneur principals retain control of the applicant
and own a substantial financial interest in the venture. At the same time, it enables noncontrolling investors outside
the control group to provide essential capital to an applicant without their revenues, assets or net worth being attributed
to the applicant or their non-minority or male status disqualifying the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
59. The Commission adopted two control group options in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the first option, passive investors are permitted to own up to 75 percent of the applicant's total equity, so
long as: (1) No investor holds more than 25 percent of the applicant's passive equity (which was subsequently defined
to include up to 15 percent of a corporation's voting stock); and (2) in the case of a corporate applicant, at least 50.1
percent of the voting stock is held by the control group. In the case of partnership applicants, the control group must
own all the general partnership interests. The Commission determined that this minimum equity level strikes an appropriate
balance between the competing considerations of permitting qualified bidders to raise capital and ensuring that
designated entities receive a significant economic benefit from the venture. The Commission extended an alternate
option to qualified women or minority-owned businesses. Under this option, the Commission would permit a single
investor in a minority or women-owned applicant to own up to 49.9 percent of the passive equity (which we subsequently
defined to include up to 15 percent of a corporation's voting stock), so long as the control group holds the remaining
50.1 percent of the equity. As with the first option, the control group is required to retain control and, in the case
of a corporate applicant, hold at least 50.1 percent of the voting stock. Also, ownership interests are to be calculated
on a fully diluted basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60. Petitions filed by BET, Columbia PCS, CTIA, EATEL, Lehman Bros. and Omnipoint variously address the Commission's
restrictions on the composition of an applicant's control group. Specifically, petitioners request clarification
that our attribution rules and definitions of minority and women-owned business be interpreted to permit ``nonqualifying''
noncontrolling investors 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the control group. ``Nonqualifying'' investors, as petitioners describe, are investors that are neither women
nor minorities, or investors that if attributed would cause the applicant to exceed the financial caps. EATEL argues
that to do otherwise may preclude participation by existing companies whose existing corporate structures would
disqualify an applicant absent significant expenditures for corporate restructuring. EATEL maintains that existing
entities have the greatest amount to offer applicants in terms of financial and technical resources. Petitioners
also request that the Commission allow a limited amount of equity investment in the control group to help the applicant
comply with the 25 percent minimum equity requirement. Columbia PCS, for example, advocates adoption of a bright-line
test that would require at least a 75 percent equity and a 100 percent voting interest in the control group to be held
by ``qualifying'' entities. Columbia PCS maintains that designated entities will be unable to raise sufficient
capital unless this clarification is made. EATEL and CTIA maintain that the 100 percent equity requirement for minority
and women-owned control groups is too restrictive for entities already in existence. Instead, they argue that businesses
which are in fact 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
controlled
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by women and/or minorities, but which have numerous non-controlling shareholders (including some that are neither
women nor minorities), should be eligible for the preferences we adopted for minority and women-owned businesses.
BET also requests clarification that a control group may be comprised of a single individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
61. Omnipoint, Columbia PCS, CTIA and Lehman Brothers contend that the 25 percent minimum equity ownership restriction
is too high and that designated entities will face insurmountable difficulties arranging financing if it is not reduced.
To remedy this problem, Lehman Brothers proposes two alternative solutions. First, for publicly traded companies,
Lehman proposes that public shareholders with less than 5 percent equity should be counted towards the control group's
25 percent equity threshold. Lehman maintains that this proposal would permit control group equity to be diluted
by new shareholders, but not below a minimum equity level (Lehman recommends 10 percent). Second, Lehman suggests
that all designated entities should be permitted to dilute their 25 percent equity interests in the following circumstances:
(a) Not earlier than one year after license grant, to dilute control group equity to a total of not less than 20 percent;
(b) not earlier than two years, to dilute control group entity to a total of not less than 15 percent; and (c) not earlier
than three years to dilute control group equity to a total of not less than 10 percent. Lehman argues that this proposal
would provide designated entities efficient access to capital, thereby improving their competitive position.
CTIA recommends that an applicant should be eligible to bid on the C and F blocks with at least 10 percent equity. Lehaman
Brothers requests that the Commission modify its control group definition to provide that members of the control
group receive dividends, profits and regular and liquidating distributions in proportion to the actual possession
of equity held, rather than in proportion to their interest in the total equity of the applicant. Lehman Brothers contends
that our rules could be interpreted to mean that such distributions must be paid on options held but not exercised by
control group members, rather than on the basis of actual shares held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
62. After considering the record, and as described below, we modify our rules to allow certain noncontrolling investors
who do not qualify for the entrepreneurs' block or as a small business to be investors in an applicant's control group.
We also allow entities that are controlled by minorities and/or women, but that have investors that are neither minorities
nor women, to be part of the control group. We agree with petitioners that some accommodation should be made in our regulations
to allow participation in an applicant's control group by existing firms controlled by designated entities or entrepreneurs
that have investors that, if attributed, would cause the applicant to exceed the small business or entrepreneurs'
blocks financial caps or, for minority or women-owned applicants, investors that are not minorities or women. We
will therefore modify our definition of a minority and women-owned business to include preexisting companies that
are controlled by women or minorities but have noncontrolling investors in the control group who are not minorities
or women. Similarly, we will allow preexisting companies that, in aggregate, meet our entrepreneurs' block and small
business size standards to be members of the control group even if one or more of the noncontrolling investors in those
companies would disqualify the company based on its gross revenues or total assets. We believe that these rule changes
will provide a reasonable balance between the need to ensure that designated entities have a significant economic
investment in the applicant and the financing realities of a PCS venture.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
63. We also agree with petitioners that it is not optimal to require the qualifying control group members to hold at
least 25 percent of the applicant's equity. The record indicates that in many cases, designated entities and entrepreneurial
principals will have limited capital to contribute to the applicant's equity and that nonontrolling investors will
be unwilling to advance funds to enable the designated entity (even one with management expertise) to reach the 25
percent threshold. Thus, without some modifications to our rules, designated entities could face insurmountable
difficulties in arranging financing. We therefore conclude that we should modify our rules to address petitioners'
concerns, while balancing the need to ensure meaningful equity participation by ``qualifying'' control group members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64. Specifically, we will retain the 25 percent minimum equity requirement for the control group, but we will require
only 15 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 60 percent of the control group's 25 percent equity contribution) to be held by qualifying, controlling principals
in the control group (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 minorities, women or small/entrepreneurial business principals). For example, if the applicant seeks minority
or women-owned status, the 15 percent equity (as well as 50.1 percent of the voting stock of the applicant) must be owned
by control group members who are minorities and/or women. If the applicant seeks small business status, 15 percent
of the equity must be held by control group members who, in the aggregate, qualify as a small business.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 The composition of the principals of the control group determines whether the applicant qualifies for bidding credits,
installment payments and reduced upfront payments. The 15 percent may be held in the form of options, provided these
options are exercisable at any time, solely at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than
the current market valuation of the underlying shares at the time of short-form filing. The remaining 10 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 40 percent of the control group's minimum equity contribution) may be held in the form of either stock options or shares,
and we will allow certain investors that are not minorities, women, small businesses or entrepreneurs to hold interests
in such shares or options. Specifically, we will allow the 10 percent portion to be held in the form of shares or stock
options by: (1) Investors in the control group that are women, minorities, small businesses or entrepreneurs; (2)
individuals who are members of an applicant's management team (which could include individuals who are not minorities
or women or individuals who have affiliates that exceed the entrepreneurs' blocks or small business size thresholds);
(3) existing investors of businesses in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior
to December 31, 1994; or (4) noncontrolling institutional investors.

For instance, if a preexisting company wants to qualify as a small business control group, its gross revenues and total
assets will be added to the gross revenues and assets of each of its controlling shareholders and to those of all affiliates.
The resulting sum must be under $40 million in gross revenues and $500 million in total assets. The gross revenues and
total assets of the company's preexisting, noncontrolling shareholders will be ignored, however.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
65. The Commission also adopted an alternative to the 25 percent minimum equity requirement for minority and women-owned
businesses, which permits a single investor to hold as much as 49.9 percent of its equity, provided the control group
holds at least 50.1 percent. Several petitioners have expressed similar concerns with respect to the need to revise
the 50.1 percent requirements. Therefore, in tandem with, and for the same reasons as, the modifications to the 25
percent equity requirement, we make similar modifications to the rules governing the 50.1 percent minimum equity
requirement. Accordingly, where a minority or women-owned business uses the 50.1 percent minimum equity option,
we will require only 30 percent of the total equity to be held by the principals of the control group that are minorities
or women. The 30 percent may be held in the form of options, provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely
at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying
shares at the time of short-form filing. The remaining 20.1 percent may be made up of shares and/or options held by investors
that are not women or minorities under the same criteria described in paragraph 64 above. That is, the 20.1 percent
portion of the control group's equity may be held in the form of shares or stock options by any of the following: (1) Investors
in the control group that are minorities, women, small businesses or entrepreneurs; (2) individuals who are members
of an applicant's management team (which could include individuals who are not minorities or women, or individuals
who have affiliates that exceed the entrepreneurs' blocks and small business size standards); (3) existing investors
of businesses in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior to December 31, 1994;
or (4) noncontrolling institutional investors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For our purposes, we define institutional investors in a manner that is similar to the definition that is used by the
Commission in the attribution rules applied to assess compliance with the broadcast multiple ownership; rules.
We modify that definition slightly, however, to fit this service. Specifically, we expect that investment companies
will be important sources of capital formation for designated entities. Accordingly, we adopt a definition that
specifically includes venture capital firms and other smaller investment companies that may not be included in the
definition of investment companies found in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3 (which is cited in our broadcast rules at 47 CFR 73.3555
Note 2(c)). Specifically, we define an institutional investor as an insurance company, a bank holding stock in trust
accounts through its trust department, or an investment company as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a) without reference
to, or incorporation of, the exemptions set forth in 15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;3(b) and (c); provided that, if such investment
company is owned, in whole or in part, by other entities, then such investment company, such other entities and the
affiliates of such other entities, taken as a whole, must be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting
or trading in securities or in distributing or providing investment management services for securities.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
66. In addition, the control group minimum equity requirement will be reduced three years from the date of license
grant as suggested by Lehman Brothers, but the control group must still retain voting control (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 50.1 percent of the vote). According the control group the option to reduce the equity requirement accommodates the
needs of designated entity licensees to raise capita as they build out their systems. Significantly, the three-year
mark corresponds with the end of the no transfer period under our license holding rule. In the case of a licensee that
has chosen the 25 percent minimum equity option, the principals in the control group will only be required to hold 10
percent of the licensee's equity after three years, with no further equity requirements imposed on the control group.
Similarly, in the case of a licensee that has used the 50.1 percent minimum equity option, the principals in the control
group will be required to hold 20 percent of the licensee's equity, and no further equity requirements will be imposed
on the control group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
67. After reviewing the record, we are persuaded that these changes will afford the control group greater flexibility
in raising the necessary equity for participation in the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, we are allowing that
10 (or 20.1) percent of the equity can come from sources that otherwise would not qualify for the control group. In making
these limited changes to the control group equity requirements, we believe the amended rules will: (1) promote investment
in designated entities generally; (2) attract and promote skilled management for applicants; and (3) encourage
involvement by existing firms that have valuable management skills and resources to contribute to the success of
applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
68. With respect to our decision to allow investment in the control group by investors of preexisting firms, the business
involved must be a going concern that has been in existence for a reasonable period of time prior to adoption of our rules
in order to avoid any sham arrangements. Specifically, the business involved must have been operating and earning
revenues for at least two years prior to December 31, 1994 to qualify for this provision. While we want to relax the control
group equity requirements slightly, we also recognize there may be an incentive for nonqualifying investors to purchase
substantial interests in ``preexisting'' businesses unless we place some restrictions on those investors. As a
practical matter, however, we realize that the identity of noncontrolling investors in such businesses, particularly
if they are publicly-traded companies, will change regularly. We intend that the allowed equity (10 or 20.1 percent)
portion should be held by existing investors in such a company although we will not place limits on who qualifies as
such an investor. We emphasize, however, that we will scrutinize any significant equity restructing of preexisting
companies that occurs after adoption of our rules. We would presume that any change of equity by an investor in a preexisting
company (that is in an applicant's control group) that is five percent or less would not be significant, and the burden
is on the applicant to demonstrate whether changes in equity that exceed five percent are not significant.

69. We also agree with petitioners and commenters that greater flexibility should be afforded to any applicant whose
ownership structures were established before our designated entity requirements were formulated. Therefore,
as a further modification, if the sole control group member of an applicant is a business that was in existence and had
earnings from operations for at least two years prior to December 31, 1994, we offer the option that control group principals
establishing the applicant's status as a minority and/or women-owned business, small or entrepreneurial business
may hold 10 percent of the applicant's equity if the 25 percent equity option is used, or a 20 percent equity interest
if the 50.1 percent equity option is used.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The balance of the control group's equity contribution (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15 or 30.1 percent) must be held in the form of shares or stock options by any of the following: (1) Qualifying principals
in the control group; (2) individuals who are members of the applicant's management team (which could include ``nonqualifying''
individuals); or (3) existing investors of business in the control group that were operating and earning revenues
for two years prior to December 31, 1994.

This equity may be held outright or in the form of options provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely
at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying
shares at the time of the filing of the short-form application.

70. The lower equity requirement of 10 percent for preexisting companies that are sole control group members addresses
the concerns of these firms, many of which have already undergone successive rounds of financing that may have diluted
the qualifying investors' original equity interest in the business. Existing firms that were structured prior to
the adoption of the entrepreneurs' blocks regulatory scheme are less likely to become ``fronts'' for business that
would not qualify for the entrepreneurs' block or the special provisions accorded designated entities. This option
is solely intended to accommodate long-standing capital structures of applicants that have already been required
to dilute equity ownership to raise capital. Thus, we will require that the portion of equity not held by qualifying
principals (15 or 30.1 percent, as the case may be) to be comprised entirely of existing investors of the company (unless
the equity is held by management or qualified principals of the control group). As we stated above, we recognize that
for many companies, especially those that are publicly-traded, the identities of noncontrolling investors change
regularly. Thus we will not place limits on the amount of time a particular individual or entity must have been an investor
in the company. We emphasize, however, that we will scrutinize carefully applicants that engage in significant equity
reshuffling after adoption of our rules.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 By giving preexisting applicants additional flexibility, we do not intend to place other applicants at a competitive
disadvantage by permitting greater capital infusion from institutional investors.

71. In implementing our requirements, we will provide that where the interests in question are not held directly in
the applicant, a multiplier will be used to calculate the effective interests held by the control group principals
toward fulfillment of the minimum equity requirement. In addition, we will use a multiplier to calculate the interests
of noncontrolling investors in the control group so as to assess compliance with the 25 percent nonattributable equity
limit.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 A multiplier is a traditional tool used by the Commission to calculate the effective ownership levels of investors
that, through one or more intervening corporations, hold indirect interests in a licensee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
We illustrate the application of a multiplier as follows: If a member of a minority group or a woman holds a 25 percent
equity interest in a corporate member of the control group and that corporation holds a 25 percent equity interest
in the applicant, the effective interest for purposes of assessing compliance with the minimum equity requirement
would be 6.25 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
0.25 &times; 0.25 = 6.25). This falls well below the 25 percent requirement of our original rule. Correspondingly,
if a noncontrolling (and nonqualifying) investor holds a 40 percent interest in a corporate member of a control group
and that corporation holds 25 percent of the applicant's total equity, the effective interest held in the applicant
by the investor would be 10 percent (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
0.25 &times; .40 = 10.00). If that same investor also owns more than 15 percent of the applicant's equity outside of
the control group, it would exceed the 25 percent non-attributable equity limit.

presentation, Metricom requests that we exempt small, publicly-traded corporations with widely dispersed voting
stock ownership from our control group requirement. Metricom contends that the control group concept is unworkable
for small, publicly-traded companies, because it would not be possible to identify a group of shareholders that own
50.1 percent of the corporation's voting stock. As a result, such corporations could be unable to establish eligibility
for the entrepreneurs' blocks, or status as a small business. Metricom proposes a test for identifying small, publicly-traded
corporations with widely-dispersed voting stock ownership that closely follows guidelines used by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

73. We will adopt Metricom's proposal, and create a limited exemption from the control group requirement for small,
publicly-traded corporations with widely dispersed voting stock ownership. As Metricom points out, a significant
number of small, publicly traded companies have such widely dispersed voting stock ownership that no identifiable
control group exists or can be created. Without a control group, such companies may not be able to bid for entrepreneurs'
block licenses or quality for small business status even though their gross revenues and assets meet our financial
caps. It was not the Commission's intent that these companies be denied the opportunity to bid on the entrepreneurs
block, or to qualify for treatment as a small business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74. Consistent with Metricom's proposal, a small, publicly-traded corporation will be found to have dispersed ownership
of voting stock if no person (including any ``group'' as that term is used in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 has the power to control the election of more than 15 percent of the corporation's directors. In addition, we will require
that no person shall have an equity interest in the applicant for more than 15 percent, which is consistent with out
revised equity requirements for small business applicants utilizing a control group. Under those requirements
small business principals in an applicant's control group must hold at least 15 percent interest in the applicant
(in combination with an additional, 10 percent equity interest that may come from ``nonqualifying'' sources). A
15 percent equity requirement is appropriate here because the same percentage of equity is needed for a small business
applicant's control group to satisfy its equity obligations (unless it is a preexisting company), and because a 15
percent equity cap is likely to ensure that no control questions arise. We, emphasize that this control group exemption
will only apply to an applicant or licensee that is not controlled by any entity or group other than corporate management,
as should be the case where there is no identifiable group of shareholders holding a controlling interest in the company's
voting stock. A small corporation that has dispersed voting stock ownership and no controlling affiliates will therefore
not be required to aggregate with its own revenues and assets the revenues and assets of management and shareholders
for purposes of entrepreneurs' block eligibility or small business status.

75. Small, publicly-traded corporations that choose to exempt themselves from the control group requirement must
own all the equity and voting stock of the applicant or licensee. We find their ability to reply on the corporation's
existing capital structure to introduce new passive investment on an ongoing basis provides a level of flexibility
that is comparable to applicants/licensees with an identifiable control group. We note that minority and/or women-owned
businesses would not qualify for this exemption since a control group is necessary to determine whether the applicant
is controlled by minorities or women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
76. Finally we consider a few other points. First, as BET requests, we clarify that an individual can be the control
group of an applicant, so long as our equity requirements and other provisions are satisfied. In response to Lehman
Brothers' concerns, we clarify the control group requirements to provide that control group investors must receive
dividends, profits, and regular and liquidating distributions in proportion to their actual possession of equity
holdings, rather than in proportion to their interest in the total equity (which may include options not yet exercised).
Finally, we see no conflict in our rules with a Pacific Telesis' proposal to allow designated entities and their partners
to allocate amongst themselves tax benefits on a non-pro rata basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control in this context. We therefore clarify that a designated entity or entrepreneurs' control group must demonstrate
at least the following indicia of control to establish that it retains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control of the applicant (1) The control group must constitute or appoint more than 50 percent of the board of directors
or partnership management committee; (2) the control group must have authority to appoint, promote, demote and fire
senior executives that control the day-to-day activities of the licensee; (3) the control group must play in integral
role in all major management decisions; and (4) in the case of applicants controlled by minorities and women, at least
one minority or female control group member must have senior managerial responsibility over day-to-day operations,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as President or CEO of the licensee.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 We emphasize, however, that these criteria are guidelines only and are not necessarily dispositive of the issue of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

These same four indicia will be used to determine whether the ``qualified'' members of the control group (

 control over the control group. For example, in a women-owned limited partnership applicant with one corporate general

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
81. With respect to provisions benefitting non-majority or non-voting shareholders, we recognize that inclusion
of such provisions in a common practice to induce investment and ensure that the basic interests of such shareholders
are protected. For example, many corporations require a supermajority of shareholders to approve major corporate
decisions such as taking on additional debt, significant corporate acquisitions, or issuance of new stock. Similarly,
strategic investors making large passive equity contributions to a company frequently insist on a right of first
refusal exercisable in the event that a third party seeks to purchase the company. We agree with petitioners that allowing
such provisions enhances the ability of designated entities to raise needed capital from strategic investors, thereby
bolstering their financial stability and competitive viability. We believe, however, that precedent provides
guidance in determining the appropriate extent to which these safeguards may protect investment. We therefore clarify
that under our case law non-majority or non-voting shareholders may be given a decision-making role (through supermajority
provisions or similar mechanisms) in major corporate decisions that fundamentally affect their interests as shareholders
without being deemed to be in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 Such decisions generally include: (1) Issuance or reclassification of stock; (2) setting compensation for senior
management; (3) expenditures that significantly affect market capitalization; (4) incurring significant corporate
debt or otherwise encumbering corporate assets; (5) sale of major corporate assets; and (6) fundamental changes
in corporate structure, including merger or dissolution.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 We also clarify that non-majority or non-voting investors may hold rights of first refusal, provided that right is
exercisable only to prevent dilution of the investor's interest or a transfer of control by the control group to a third
party. We also observe that we would not look favorably upon an assignment or transfer of a license that resulted from
rights of first refusal being exercised if (1) the holder of such rights was a manager of the licensee, and (2) there
was evidence the manager had not acted to maximize the profitability of the business in order to ensure that the options
would be exercised at a lower price.

do not in and of themselves represent the type of transfer of corporate control envisioned by Section 310(d) of the
Communications Act. We found it significant, however, that while BT could block certain major transactions by MCI,
BT could not compel MCI to engage in such major transactions. Thus, we concluded that BT's power was permissibly limited
to protecting its own investment in MCI.

de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control, some proposals made by petitioners and comments to benefit non-majority shareholders would violate this
standard. For example, non-majority shareholders should not have the power to select or replace members of the control
group or key employees of the corporation. Further, as discussed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 in this docket, we do not intend to restrict the use of preferential dividends and liquidation preferences. We will
scrutinize, however, any mechanisms that deprive the control group of the ability to realize a financial benefit
proportional to its ownership of the applicant. Finally, we emphasize that any final determination of whether a control
group has yielded 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control to outside investors must depend on the circumstances of the particular case. For example, while certain
provisions benefitting non-majority investors may not give rise to a transfer of control when considered individually,
the aggregate effect of multiple provisions could be sufficient to deprive the control group of

 Under this test, a licensee may enter into a management agreement with a third party provided that the licensee retains
exclusive responsibility for operation and control of the licensed facilities, as determined by the following six
factors: (1) Unfettered use of licensed facilities and equipment; (2) day-to-day operation and control; (3) determination
of and carrying out of policy decisions; (4) employment, supervision, and dismissal of personnel; (5) payment of
financial obligations; and (6) receipt of profits from operation of the licensed facilities.

 test and argues that further guidance from the Commission is therefore needed to prevent sham agreements between
designated entities and third party managers. Other parties also support the view that the Commission should clarify
its standards regarding management contracts, but do not necessarily agree about what standard should be anticipated.
NABOB, for example, argues that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermountain
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 test is too rigid and that a more flexible standard should be applied to designated entities who enter into management
agreements. Columbia PCS, on the other hand, contends that the Commission should apply a stricter standard by limiting
managers to performing discrete functions on a subcontractor basis as opposed to assuming broad responsibility
for system management.

 we reaffirm the applicability of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intermountain
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 factors provide reasonable benchmarks for ensuring retention of control by the licensee while allowing for full
consideration of the circumstances in each case. In the case of designated entity applicants, they will ensure that
designated entities participate actively in the day-to-day management of the company while allowing reasonable
flexibility to obtain services from outside experts as well. We believe that relaxing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

that such contracts should be subject to a stricter standard than we have applied previously. We conclude that limiting
managers to discrete ``subcontractor'' functions, as Columbia PCS proposes, could prevent designated entities
from drawing on managers with broad expertise. Moreover, whether a manager undertakes a large number of operational
functions is irrelevant to the issue of control so long as ultimate responsibility for those functions resides with
the licensee.

 parties have debated our decision to raise the voting equity threshold for closely-held applicants from five to 15
percent. AIDE argues that raising the voting level of closely-held applicants is imprudent because it increases
the likelihood that big business will control the applicant. AMP disagrees with AIDE that 15 percent voting control
would increase the likelihood of shams, because 15 percent is still not a controlling percentage. Rather, AMP argues
that increasing the permissible level of voting equity will enable applicants to attract more equity financing,
thereby increasing the applicant's likelihood of success.

89. We amend our attribution rules to raise the voting equity threshold that qualifies an investor as having an attributable
interest in an applicant to 25 percent. We will raise the voting equity level for both publicly-traded and closely-held
corporations, and will apply the 25-percent threshold for the 25/75-percent equity option available to all applicants
and to the 49.9/50.1 percent equity option additionally available to minority and/or women applicants. We observe
that 25 percent is the percentage suggested by both CTIA and BET. We agree with CTIA that investors will be more likely
to invest in new companies if they have the ability to protect their investment through increased voting rights. We
also agree that a 25-percent voting interest will not convey a significantly greater risk of control than a 15-percent
voting interest. BET asserts that higher voting thresholds will enable a larger number of existing companies_those
which have established financial structures with a higher percentage of voting stock owned by non-controlling stockholders_to
compete in the entrepreneurial block. Furthermore, in other contexts, Congress has used a 25-percent threshold
as a measure of determining control. For example, under Section 310(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 310(b),
foreign companies are permitted to directly or indirectly control up to 25 percent of CMRS licensees. We believe that
in this context as well, a 25-percent threshold strikes an appropriate balance between the need to encourage investment
and our goal of ensuring that designated entities remain in clear control. Finally, for purposes of clarification,
the maximum permissible nonattributable equity level may be no greater than 25 percent of the applicant's total equity
and includes the right to vote such share (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

For example, an investor holding 25 percent of an applicant's voting stock will not be considered a nonattributable
equity investor if it also has the right, through a voting trust or other arrangement, to vote additional shares.

90. Additionally, however, to discourage large investors from circumventing our equity limitations for nonattributable
investors, we clarify that persons or entities that are affiliates of one another, or that have an ``identity of interests,''
will be treated as though they were one person or entity and their ownership interests aggregated for purposes of determining
compliance with our maximum nonattributable equity limits. We will aggregate their ownership interests in calculating
their total equity interests in the applicant and in determining whether their gross revenues and assets will be attributed
to the applicant. Thus, for example, if two entities form a joint venture or consortium to apply for broadband PCS A
and B block licenses, they have an identity of interests that is characteristic of affiliates, and will be treated
as a single entity when investing in the same entrepreneurs' block applicant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 commenters request that we clarify our rules regarding the treatment of various ownership instruments such as warrants,
stock options and convertible debentures. Additionally, commenters have asked whether rights of first refusal
are considered options and how stock ``calls'' and ``puts'' will be treated. A ``put'' option gives the holder the
right to sell a share of stock at a specified price at any time up to the expiration date. Conversely, a ``call'' option
gives the holder the right to buy a share of stock at a specified price, known as the ``exercise price.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
93. In general, we will treat stock options as fully exercised with the exception of some ownership instruments. We
recognize that some forms of options are common and often beneficial to the management of a company. Many companies,
for example, include stock options in senior management compensation packages. We also recognize that treating
options as fully exercised will encourage companies to hire minorities and women for top management positions, because
any options they receive will count toward the equity eligibility requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94. We decide that for purposes of calculating ownership interests, however, some ownership instruments will not
be treated as ``fully diluted'', or will not be considered options generally. For example, we will not consider rights
of first refusal as options when calculating ownership interests.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 Rights of first refusal differ from other types of options because they cannot be exercised unless there is a proposed
sale to a third party. Sales and transfers to third parties are restricted during the holding period, so rights of first
refusal do not threaten the composition of designated entities.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 At the end of the five-year period, it will still be the designated entity's decision as to whether to sell the business,
which ensures that the designated entity controls the decision whether to sell. We agree that without these rights,
investors are likely to shy away from investing in designated entities. As Pacific Telesis and BellSouth point out,
rights of first refusal are a valued safeguard mechanism because they give investors some control over the entry of
new business associates. They also enable investors to prevent their own shares from becoming dilutes as a result
of a sale.

95. ``Put'' options held by the designated entity_which can be realized only after the licensee can permissibly transfer
the license_will not be treated as fully diluted for purposes of determining ownership interests. Put options held
by the designated entity leave the ownership decision in the designated entity's control and do not force an unwanted
sale upon the designated entity. We observe, however, that while such options will not be factored in for purposes
of determining 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control, we will continue to look at whether put options in combination with other terms to an agreement deprive an
otherwise qualified control group of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control over the applicant. Thus, a ``put'' in combination with other terms to an agreement may result in an applicant
not retaining 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control. For example, if an agreement between a strategic investor and a designated entity provides that (1) the investor
makes debt financing available to the applicant on very favorable terms (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 15-year term, no payments of principal or interest for six years) and (2) that the designated entity has a one-time
put right that is exercisable at a time and under conditions that are designed to maximize the incentive of the licensee
to sell (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 six years after issue, option to put partnership interest in lieu of payment of principal and accrued interest on loan),
we may conclude that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 control has been relinquished. ``Call'' options held by investors will be considered exercised immediately to calculate
ownership levels because they can be used to force a designated entity to sell its ownership interests. Finally, we
observe that such a call option would vest an impermissible degree of control in the applicant's so-called ``noncontrolling''
investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96. In summary, agreements between designated entities and strategic investors that involve terms (such as management
contracts combined with rights of first refusal, loans, puts, etc.) that cumulatively are designed financially
to force the designated entity into a sale (or major refinancing) will constitute a transfer of control under our rules.
We will look at the totality of circumstances in each particular case. We emphasize that our concerns are greatly increased
when a single entity provides most of the capital and management services and is the beneficiary of the investor protections.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we determine that bidding credits were necessary to better ensure that women and minority-owned businesses and small
businesses have meaningful opportunities to participate in broadband PCS. Accordingly, our rules provided that
small businesses will receive a 10 percent credit, women and minority-owned businesses will receive a 15 percent
credit, and small businesses owned by women and minorities will receive an aggregate credit of 25 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to enhance the effectiveness of the entrepreneurs' blocks through the addition of bidding credits reflected our
expectation that broadband PCS will be a capital intensive undertaking. We stated that bidding credits would function
as a discount on the bid price a firm will actually have to pay to obtain a license and, thus, would directly address the
obstacles to raising capital encountered by small, women and minority-owned firms.

98. Several petitioners request that we increase the level of bidding credits. For example, while some petitioners
argue in favor of higher bidding credits for all designated entities, others seek to raise the bidding credit for women
and minority-owned businesses, or only for minority-owned small businesses. Many of these petitioners find support
in our

 in this docket, where we raised the bidding credit for minority and women-owned businesses bidding on regional narrowband
PCS licenses from 25 percent to 40 percent.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 Two petitioners contend that rural telephone companies should receive a 10 percent bidding credit, that would be
cumulative with any other bidding credits for which the applicant would be eligible. Finally, consistent with its
argument that the entrepreneurs' blocks should be abolished, GTE supports availability of bidding credits across
all broadband PCS channel blocks.

99. We will retain our existing bidding credit scheme. Present levels of bidding credits, coupled with other provisions
directed at the capital formation problems of designated entities, such as size limitations on the entrepreneurs'
block and installment payments, are sufficient to achieve our regulatory objectives. Moreover, additional measures
that we have adopted on reconsideration, including elimination of the limits on personal net worth and relaxation
on the attribution of affiliates owned and controlled by minorities, will further enhance the value of the bidding
credits to women and minority-owned firms in particular. We find that our action on reconsideration of the narrowband
PCS auction rules does not dictate raising the bidding credit in this instance. As the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 makes clear, the 40 percent bidding credit for women and minorities bidding on regional narrowband PCS licenses was
adopted in the absence of any entrepreneurs' blocks. Further, we state that in the insulated entrepreneurs' block
setting, a 25 percent bidding credit for minority and/or women-owned small firms is more appropriate. We also find
that the record does not support creation of a new bidding credit for rural telephone companies. In this regard, we
agree with BET that petitioners have failed to demonstrate a historical lack of access to capital that was the basis
for according bidding credits to small businesses, minorities and women. To the extent that a rural telephone company
is also a small business, or minority or women-owned, then bidding credits would, of course, be available. We also
decline to adopt GTE's scheme to eliminate the entrepreneurs' blocks, and distribute bidding credits throughout
the broadband PCS channel blocks. As Omnipoint, Columbia PCS and ET observe, the insulation provided by the entrepreneurs'
block is key to the utility of bidding credits in such a capital intensive undertaking.

Installment Payments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
100. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 we made installment payments available to most businesses that obtain entrepreneurs' block licenses. Installment
payments directly address the significant barriers that smaller businesses face in accessing private financing.
With the expectation of enormous costs associated with obtaining and operating a broadband PCS license, installment
payments provide low-cost government financing that reduces the amount of private financing needed before and after
the auction. Our installment payment plan was made available to all entrepreneurs' block eligibles granted licenses
in the 50 largest BTAs. In the smaller BTAs where the costs of license acquisition and operation are expected to be lower,
installment payments are only available to licensees owned by women and minorities, and licensees with less than
$75 million in gross revenues. We also provided an ``enhanced'' installment payment plan for small businesses and
businesses owned by women and minorities where interest-only payments were required for such entities for as long
as five years from the date of license grant if the firm is both small and owned by women or minorities. By tailoring the
deferral of principal payments to the needs of the particular designated entities, we promoted greater participation
in broadband PCS by viable competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
101. Vanguard asks us to offer installment payments to all entrepreneurs' block winners for all BTAs. Without this
relief, Vanguard contends that small cellular carriers that are, in fact, more likely to serve the smaller markets
would be forced to comply with the same payment schedule as large carriers bidding for smaller markets. SBPCS seeks
to eliminate interest on installment payments altogether, and limit availability of installment payment plans
to revenue less than $75 million dollars. Hernandez requests that the Commission require bidders to demonstrate
their ability to meet the terms of an installment payment plan when the short-form application is filed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
102. We will extend availability of installment payments to all entrepreneurs' block licensees, regardless of gross
revenues. A key factor to the overall success of the entrepreneurs' blocks is the installment payment plan. The installment
plan was established to facilitate the entry of small and minority-owned businesses into the broadband PCS market.
The top 50 BTAs will be the most competitive wireless communications markets in the country and will require inordinately
large amounts of capital. It will be extremely challenging for any entrepreneurs' block participant to compete in
these markets. The installment plans will greatly enhance the ability of all entrepreneurs' block participants
to raise capital to succeed against major, well-capitalized competitors. As Vanguard points out, disallowing installment
payments to large entrepreneurs' block winners of small BTAs unfairly restricts these companies from competing
for markets in which they will have a logical interest. In addition, the larger entrepreneurs would be forced to pay
for BTAs on the same terms as major companies that do not qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks. While we accept these
arguments, and therefore extend installment payments to all entrepreneur's block licensees, we note that the terms
of these payments should be less generous than those extended to smaller companies, less able to access traditional
sources of capital. Therefore, we will require entrepreneurs with gross revenues exceeding $75 million to make a
post-auction down payment equaling ten percent of their winning bids, but then pay the remaining 90 percent of the
auction price in installments with interest charges to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to that for ten-year
U.S. Treasury obligations plus 3.5 percent, with payments on both interest and principal required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
103. We decline to reduce or eliminate interest rates entirely because we believe that the present approach achieves
the proper balance among our regulatory objectives. In particular, our present tailoring of interest rates to the
needs of the designated entity enables licenses to be disseminated to small businesses and furthers the congressional
goal of allowing taxpayers to reap a portion of the value of the licenses. Reducing or eliminating interest payments
could result in very high bids, which could reduce competition and promote defaults among entrepreneurs. Such an
approach could also encourage speculation instead of legitimate applicants who can attract capital. On our own motion,
however we will amend 47 C.F.R. &sect;24.711 to permit small businesses owned by minorities and/or women to make interest-only
payments for six years from the date of license grant. Under our current rules, principal payments start to come due
at the same time the entrepreneur is permitted to transfer the license and immediately following the first, build-out
requirement. By deferring payment of principal an additional year, we intend to assist the designated entity in avoiding
an unwanted sale of business at the five-year mark in order to avoid payment of principal. Finally, for the reasons
discussed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we believe that our existing requirements for broadband PCS auction applicants adequately measure an applicant's
ability to pay.
<FOOTCITE>60</FOOTCITE>
 We therefore decline to impose more stringent requirements to determine whether an applicant can meet the terms of
an installment payment plan.

104. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission established several provisions to help rural telephone companies become meaningful participants
in the emerging PCS market. In that proceeding, we defined a rural telephone company as a local exchange carrier having
100,000 or fewer access lines, including all affiliates. In departing from the more restrictive definition adopted
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission stated that the revised definition strikes an appropriate balance by facilitating the rapid deployment
of broadband PCS to rural areas, without giving benefits to large companies that do not require special assistance.
Qualified rural telephone companies are eligible for broadband PCS licenses through a partitioning system, which
permits rural telephone companies to obtain licenses that are geographically partitioned from larger PCS service
areas. These companies will be permitted to acquire partitioned broadband PCS licenses in any frequency block in
two ways: (l) they may form bidding consortia consisting entirely of rural telephone companies to participate in
the auctions, and then partition the licenses won among consortia participants; and (2) they may acquire partitioned
broadband PCS licenses from other licensees through private negotiation and agreement either before or after the
auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105. Under our rules, if a rural telephone company receives a partitioned license from another PCS licensee in a post-auction
transaction, the partitioned area must be reasonably related to the rural telephone company's wireline service
area that lies within the PCS service area. We recognized in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning areas in which they will receive partitioned
licenses, so we did not adopt a strict rule concerning the reasonableness of the partitioned area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

106. Petitioners variously request the Commission modify our rural telephone company provisions. Century Telephone
Enterprises, Inc. (Century) and Citizens Utilities Company (Citizens) argue that the rural telephone company definition
adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is overly restrictive and excludes local exchange carriers that exceed the access line standard but nevertheless
serve predominantly rural areas. Alternatively, Citizens requests the Commission implement waiver procedures.
In addition, Hicks and Ragland and TEC urge the Commission to eliminate its partitioned service area limitations,
stating that the present rules unnecessarily impede the ability of a rural telephone company to provide service in
a technically and economically feasible manner. Finally, MEANS/SDN and TEC contend the rural telephone companies
should be afforded the same benefits as other designated entities, including outside passive investment in rural
telephone company consortia and bidding credits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
107. We generally will retain the rural telephone company provisions adopted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We remain convinced that our definition of rural telephone company, which reflects the views of numerous parties
to this proceeding, will ensure that broadband PCS will be deployed rapidly to rural areas. At the same time, it is narrowly
tailored to exclude large local exchange carriers that do not require special treatment. We observe that we can entertain
and grant a waiver request if a local exchange carrier that does not satisfy our rural telephone company definition
can meet our waiver standard set forth in Section 24.819 of the Commission's Rules to warrant qualifying the LEC for
a partitioned broadband PCS license.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
108. We continue to believe that our existing rules, which allow rural telephone companies to obtain broadband PCS
licenses that are geographically partitioned from larger PCS service areas, will provide a viable opportunity for
these entities to successfully acquire PCS licenses and offer service to rural areas. We are confident that the partitioning
system articulated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
satisfies the directive of Congress to ensure that rural telephone companies have the opportunity to provide PCS
services to all areas of the country, including rural areas. In addition, we believe that the other benefits afforded
to designated entities, combined with the cellular attribution threshold for rural telephone companies adopted
in Gen. Docket No. 90&hyph;314, will further ensure that rural areas have expedient access to PCS services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
109. We disagree with MEANS/SDN's contention that modifications to our consortia provisions are needed to fulfill
Congress' mandate that rural telephone companies have an opportunity to acquire PCS licenses. As we noted in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we expect that virtually all rural telephone company consortia will be eligible to bid on licenses in Blocks C and F
without competition from ``deep pocket'' bidders. Additionally, if consortia members qualify as small businesses,
the Commission will provide the bidding credit and installment payment provisions extended to similarly-situated
applicants. Accordingly, we believe it is unnecessary to permit passive equity investments in rural telephone company
consortia, as MEANS/SDN requests. Indeed we do not extend similar benefits to small, non-rural telephone businesses
that form bidding consortia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110. We also reject TEC's and MEANS/SDN's proposal to extend bidding credits to rural telephone companies even if
they are not small businesses or owned by minorities and/or women. We continue to believe that existing benefits for
rural telephone companies will allow them to effectively compete for licenses that serve rural territories. In addition
to the partitioning and consortia provisions, we also note that rural telephone companies qualify for significant
financial benefits from the Rural Electrification Administration and the Universal Service Fund, which as BET suggests,
adequately compensates these entities for the lack of bidding credits. Additionally, we note that our bidding credits
were specifically tailored to address the discriminatory market barriers faced by women and minority-owned entities.
We concur with BET's assessment that rural telephone companies do not face the same kinds of barriers raising capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
111. We note that most, if not all, rural telephone companies meet the entrepreneurs' block size standards and are
permitted to bid directly on entrepreneurs' blocks licenses. To the extent that a rural telephone company does not
qualify for the entrepreneurs' blocks, however, we disagree that it will be forced to negotiate with other licensees
that may not be willing to sell their broadband PCS interests in the from of partitioned licenses or other ownership
arrangements. On the contrary, we believe that other applicants and licensees will find rural telephone companies
attractive entities to negotiate with, because of the efficiencies associated with rural telephone companies existing
infrastructure. Additionally, since a licensee will be permitted to assign a portion of its license to a rural telephone
company without violating the transfer and holding requirements, we expect that licensees will actively solicit
participation by rural telephone companies. For the reasons discussed above, we continue to believe that our existing
scheme, which is narrowly tailored to satisfy Congress' mandate, will provide rural telephone companies with a meaningful
opportunity to participate in the provision of broadband PCS services and further the objective of rapidly getting
service to rural areas.

112. Finally, we dismiss concerns raised by TEC and Hicks and Ragland concerning the permissible size of a rural telephone
company's service area. We addressed these concerns in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and concluded that a partitioned area containing no more than twice the population of that portion of a rural telephone
company's wireline service area provides a reasonable presumption of a permissible service territory. However,
we agree that rural telephone companies will require some flexibility in fashioning a partitioned service area and
thereby affirm our prior conclusion that a strict rule is not needed.

in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
restrict the number of licenses within the entrepreneurs' block that a single entity may win at auction. Specifically,
we impose a limitation that no single entity may win more than 10 percent of the licenses available in the entrepreneurs'
blocks, or 98 licenses. We indicated that the 98 licenses may all be in frequency block C or all in frequency block F,
or in some combination of the two blocks. We observed that such a limit would ensure that at least 10 winning bidders
enjoy the benefits of the entrepreneurs' blocks, while also allowing bidders to effectuate aggregation strategies
that include large numbers of licenses and extensive geographic coverage. We provided that the limit would apply
only to the total number of licenses that may be won at auction on the C and F blocks. Furthermore, we indicated that for
purposes of this restriction we will consider licenses to be won by the same entity if an applicant (or other entity)
that controls, or has the power to control licenses won at the auction, controls or has the power to control another
license at the auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
114. On reconsideration, the Small Business PCS Association (SBPCS) recommends that the maximum number of entrepreneurs'
block licenses purchased by a single entity be limited to licenses that cover no more than a total of 10 percent of the
national population, or approximately 25 million ``pops.'' SBPCS expresses concern that the existing limit does
not provide for enough diversity of ownership since it would allow a single entity to acquire the top 98 BTA licenses
on the 30 MHz entrepreneurs' blocks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
115. After considering SBPCS' concerns, we will retain the existing limit, which prevents any single entity from
acquiring more than 10 percent of the entrepreneurs' block licenses. We believe that changing the limit to 10 percent
of the population or 25 million ``pops'' rule would be overly restrictive. We note, for example, that successful entrepreneurs
will need to form coherent regional ``cluster'' strategies to compete against large communications companies,
such as dominant cellular providers, and that such regional clusters may come together into a national alliance with
common technology and marketing strategies, including a common brand name. A 25 million ``pops'' per entity limit
would severely restrict entrepreneurs that win the New York BTA (with 18 million ``pops'') and the Los Angeles BTA
(with 15 million ``pops'') from any meaningful regional cluster strategy, given the size of adjoining markets. In
light of this concern, we want to be careful not to impose a restriction that would unfairly disadvantage C and F block
new entrants in the new PCS marketplace. We are satisfied that the present limit achieves the proper balance between
promoting fair distribution of benefits and ensuring that entrepreneur block winners have enough flexibility to
develop competitive systems on a regional and nationwide basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fifth Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
restrictions on the transfer or assignment of licenses were adopted to ensure that designated entities do not take
advantage of special entrepreneurs' block provisions by immediately assigning or transferring control of their
licenses to non-designated entities. We indicated that the ``trafficking'' of licenses in this manner would unjustly
enrich the auction winners and would undermine the congressional objective of giving designated entities the opportunity
to provide spectrum-based services. Thus, our rules prohibit licensees in the entrepreneurs' blocks from voluntarily
assigning or transferring control of their licenses during the three years after the date of the license grant.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 For the subsequent two years (or the fourth and fifth years of the term), the licensee is permitted to assign or transfer
control of its authorization only to an entity that satisfies the entrepreneurs' blocks entry criteria.

117. We also provided that during the five-year period licensees cannot assign an attributable interest in the license
that would cause them to exceed the financial eligibility requirements.
<FOOTCITE>62</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, we stated that a transferee or assignee who receives a C or F block license during the five-year holding
period will remain subject to the transfer restrictions for the balance of the holding period. Thus, if a C-block authorization
is assigned to an eligible business in year four of the license term, it will be required to hold that license until the
original five-year period expires, subject to the same exceptions that applied to the original licensee. Moreover,
we stated that we will conduct random pre- and post-auction audits to ensure that applicants receiving preferences
are in compliance with the Commission's rules.

, we also adopted rules to prevent entrepreneur block license holders from realizing any unjust enrichment that is
gained through a transfer or assignment that occurs during the original license term.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, we provided that if, within the original license term, a licensee applies to assign or transfer control
of a license to an entity that is not eligible for as high a level of bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding
credit obtained by the assigning party and the bidding credit for which the acquiring party would qualify, must be
paid to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of approval of the transfer or assignment.

While we indicated that the five-year holding and limited transfer requirements in the entrepreneurs' blocks limit
the applicability of unjust enrichment provisions generally during the first five-years of the license term (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, in cases where the license-holder has engaged in a permissible transfer or assignment where the buyer is eligible
for comparable bidding credits or is qualified for installment payments), we indicated that such provisions were
still useful, particularly since they are applicable for the full ten-year license term.

119. We adopted similar requirements with respect to repayment of installment payments. Specifically, if a licensee
that was awarded installment payments seeks to assign or transfer control of its license during the term of a license
to an entity not meeting the applicable eligibility standards, we require payment of the remaining principal and
any interest accrued through the date of assignment as a condition of approval of the transfer or assignment. Accordingly,
we explained that if an entity seeks to assign or transfer control of a license to an entity that does not quality for
as favorable an installment payment plan, the installment payment plan, if any, for which the acquiring entity qualifies
will become effective immediately upon transfer or assignment of the license. Thus, a higher interest rate and earlier
payment of principal may begin to be applied.

120. Two petitioners discussed the holding period and limited transfer restrictions imposed on entrepreneurs'
block licenses. Specifically, AIDE requests the Commission repeal the five-year holding period, contending that
the unjust enrichment provisions (to the extent they promote recovery of bidding credits and installment payments)
eliminate the need for such a restriction. AIDE also argues that once a designated entity receives a spectrum-based
license, the mandate of Congress to provide these entities with a fair opportunity to provide spectrum-based services
is satisfied, and that there is no justification for any further restrictions beyond that point in time. AIDE also
wants clarification of how our unjust enrichment provisions will apply if a transfer or assignment does occur during
the five-year holding period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
121. Additionally, CTIA requests that the Commission amend its transfer restrictions to allow all PCS licensees
(including entrepreneurs' blocks and designated entities) to transfer 5 MHz of spectrum immediately after license
grant. Alternatively, CTIA asks that transfer be permitted within one year after service is initiated by a new PCS
entrant in the relevant PCS service area. CTIA contends that this change is needed to provide cellular carriers with
reasonable flexibility to reach the 40 MHz PCS spectrum cap (especially in secondary market transactions), and may
increase the value of spectrum at auction (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by providing designated entities with an added source of funding and ensuring that market forces place the spectrum
in the hands of those who value it most highly).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
122. We will not modify our five-year holding period and limit transfer restrictions. While AIDE and CTIA ask us to
eliminate or significantly relax our restrictions, many commenters generally support the idea of a holding and limited
transfer period for entrepreneurs' block licenses. BET, for example, contends that without a holding requirement,
the opportunities for circumventing the Commission's rules are increased as non-designated entities weigh the
benefits of sacrificing certain preferences (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bidding credits) in exchange for control of a valuable PCS license. Contrary to AIDE's point of view, we believe that
unjust enrichment provisions alone do not provide adequate safeguards for ensuring that designated entities retain

control over their licenses. We are satisfied that the five-year holding period and limited transfer restrictions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

123. Additionally we reject CTIA's request to permit 5 MHz of spectrum to be transferred after the license grant because
it would contradict our determinations in the PCS service rules docket (Gen. Docket 90&hyph;314) concerning the
disaggregation of broadband PCS spectrum. In that docket, we decided that no disaggregation of spectrum should be
allowed until a broadband PCS licensee had met our five-year construction requirements.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 We also determined that in-region cellular interests should not be permitted to acquire 10 MHz of broadband PCS spectrum
until the year 2000_when they would be eligible for an additional 5 MHz of spectrum in their service areas.

124. In addition, we wish to clarify the application of our holding rule to our financial caps. As we have stated, under
certain circumstances we will allow licensees to retain their eligibility during the holding period, even if the
company has grown beyond our size limitations for the entrepreneurs' block and for small business eligibility. Thus,
we will permit entrepreneurs' block licensees to transfer their licenses in years four through five to other entrepreneurs'
block licensees even if it would result in growth beyond the permissible gross assets and total revenues caps, as long
as it otherwise complies with our control group and equity requirements. We believe this encourages designated entities
to grow, instead of penalizing them for their success, which was a concern expressed by some commenters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
125. Further, we clarify that between years four and five we will allow licensees to transfer a license to any entity
that either holds other entrepreneurs' block licenses (and thus at the time of auction satisfied the entrepreneurs'
block criteria) or that satisfies the criteria at the time of transfer. Unjust enrichment penalties apply if these
requirements are not met, or if they qualified for different provisions at the time of licensing. For purposes of determining
size eligibility for transfers or assignments that occur between the fourth and fifth years, we will use the most recently
available audited financial statements in cases where the entity to whom the license is being transferred did not
win a license in the original entrepreneurs' block auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
126. AIDE sought clarification concerning the application of our unjust enrichment provisions to our holding period
and limited transfer rules. In response to their request, we reiterate that if a designated entity transfers or assigns
its license before year five to a company that qualifies for no bidding credit, then such a sale will entail full payment
of the bidding credit as a condition of transfer. If, however, the same transaction occurs (during the same time frame),
but the buyer is eligible for a lesser bidding credit, then the difference between the bidding credit obtained by the
seller and the bidding credit for which the buyer would qualify, must be paid to the U.S. Treasury for the transaction
to be approved by the FCC. With respect to installment payments, we confirm that we expect that when the purchaser is
not to an entity that qualifies for any installment payment plan, we will require payment of the unpaid balance in full
before the sale will be approved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
was generic and that the Commission does not intend to limit itself to conducting ``random'' audits. While random
selection for audit may be one, acceptable enforcement technique in some cases, it may not be the most efficient. We
expect that audits might also be undertaken on information received from third parties or on the basis of other factors.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 Since the audit process will involve the application of in-house and contract resources, we intend to pursue a course
of audits that will be efficient as well as effective. Consequently, we are amending the rules to more fully reflect
the variety of circumstances that might lead to an audit. We will also add an audit consent to the FCC short-form and
other forms where eligibility must be established. Because the Commission's audit program will cover all auction
applications, regardless of the service involved, we will promulgate conforming amendments to Subpart Q in Part
1 of the Commission's regulations in a separate order.

While we anticipate that public scrutiny of entrepreneurs' block applications and the petition to deny process,

against those who abuse our processes. We also emphasize that the initiation of an investigation by the Commission

of a licensee's facilities pending the outcome of such investigation.

the measures to assist designated entities adopted pursuant to Section 309(j) of the Communications Act. To facilitate
our audit program and to provide preliminary assurances that those applicants claiming eligibility for such preferences
are in compliance with the regulatory requirements concerning ownership and financial status, we will require that
applicants list their control group members, affiliates, attributable investors, gross revenues, total assets
and other basic ownership and eligibility information in an exhibit to their short-form applications. Additional,
more detailed information concerning eligibility will be required of winning bidders. All applicants are required
to maintain an updated file of documentary evidence supporting the information and the status claimed. Applicants
that do not win the licenses for which they applied, shall maintain such records until final grant of the license(s)
in question, or one year from the date of the filing of their short-form applications, whichever is earlier. Licensees
shall maintain such records for the term of the license.

measures, we may consider, for example, the licensee's payment history, including whether it has defaulted before
and how far into the license term the default occurs, the reasons for default, whether the licensee has met construction
build-out requirements, the licensee's financial condition, and whether the licensee is seeking a buyer under a
distress sale policy. Following a grace period without successful resumption of payment or upon denial of a grace
period request, we will declare the license cancelled and take appropriate measures under the Commission's debt
collection rules and procedures.

131. Since several commenters requested clarification as to what the Commission would allow in the event a licensee
defaults on payment of its installment monies, we clarify that lenders and entrepreneurs' block licensees are free
to agree contractually to their own terms regarding situations where the licensee has defaulted under the Commission's
installment payment program, and possibly other obligations. As long as there is no transfer of control, we would
not become involved in the particulars of a voluntary workout arrangement between a designated entity and a third-party
lender.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
132. Specifically, an entrepreneurs' block licensee and its lenders may agree that, in the event the licensee defaults
on its installment payments, the lenders to that licensee will cure this default by assuming the designated entity's
payments to the government. Barring any transfer of control, we would not object to such an arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
133. In the event a transfer of control is sought under the terms of the workout, the licensee and its lenders must apply
for Commission approval of the transfer, in accordance with Section 310(d) of the Communications Act. In a situation
where the lender itself is the proposed buyer or transferee, we would scrutinize such an application to determine
whether, by virtue of the loan agreement, an earlier transfer of control was effectuated. We clarify that we would
also expect that any requirements that arise by virtue of a licensee's status as an entrepreneur or as a designated
entity would be satisfied with respect to such a sale. Thus, for example, the transfer would need to be to another qualified
entrepreneur if it is to occur within our five-year holding period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
134. In the event an entrepreneurs' block licensee becomes subject to bankruptcy, our existing rules and precedent
clarify how the Commission would dispose of a license in such a circumstance. Specifically, transfer to a bankruptcy
trustee is viewed as an involuntary transfer or assignment to another party under Section 24.839 of the Commission's
Rules.
<FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>
 In such a case therefore, there would be a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro forma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 involuntary assignment of the license to a court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy, or to the licensee, as a debtor-in-possession.
Assuming the bankrupt estate is liquidated or the trustee finds a qualified purchaser for the licensee's system,
and assuming payments to the Commission are maintained or a grace period granted, we will continue generally to defer
to federal bankruptcy laws on many matters.
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 We would, however, ultimately have to approve any final transfer of the license. As stated above, we would expect that
any requirements that arise by virtue of a licensee's status as an entrepreneur or as a designated entity would be satisfied
with respect to such a sale. Thus, for example, the transfer would need to be to another qualified entrepreneur if it
is to occur within our five-year holding period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Basis for Affiliation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An individual or entity is an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
affiliate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of an applicant or of a person holding an attributable interest in an applicant (both referred to herein as ``the applicant'')
if such individual or entity:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is directly or indirectly controlled by a third party or parties that also controls or has the power to control
the applicant, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Has an ``identity of interest'' with the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nature of control in determining affiliation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Every business concern is considered to have one or more parties who directly or indirectly control or have the
power to control it. Control may be affirmative or negative and it is immaterial whether it is exercised so long as the
power to control exists.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example for paragraph (l)(2)(i). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An applicant owning 50 percent of the voting stock of another concern would have negative power to control such concern
since such party can block any action of the other stockholders. Also, the bylaws of a corporation may permit a stockholder
with less than 50 percent of the voting to block any actions taken by the other stockholders in the other entity. Affiliation
exists when the applicant has the power to control a concern while at the same time another person, or persons, are in
control of the concern at the will of the party or parties with the power of control.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Control can arise through stock ownership; occupancy of director, officer or key employee positions; contractual
or other business relations; or combinations of these and other factors. A key employee is an employee who, because
of his/her position in the concern, has a critical influence in or substantive control over the operations or management
of the concern.

no effective control can be established.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In a corporation where the officers and directors own various size blocks of stock totaling 40 percent of the corporation's
voting stock, but no officer or director has a block sufficient to give him or her control or the power to control and
the remaining 60 percent is widely distributed with no individual stockholder having a stock interest greater than
10 percent, management has the power to control. If persons with such management control of the other entity are persons
with attributable interests in the applicant, the other entity will be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

Identity of interest between and among persons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Affiliation can arise between or among two or more persons with an identity of interest, such as members of the same
family or persons with common investments. In determining if the applicant controls or is controlled by a concern,
persons with an identity of interest will be treated as though they were one person.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Two shareholders in Corporation Y each have attributable interests in the same PCS application. While neither shareholder
has enough shares to individually control Corporation Y, together they have the power to control Corporation Y. The
two shareholders with these common investments (or identity in interest) are treated as though they are one person
and Corporation Y would be deemed an affiliate of the applicant.

Kinship Affiliation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Immediate family members will be presumed to own or control or have the power to control interests owned or controlled
by other immediate family members. In this context ``immediate family member'' means father, mother, husband, wife,
son, daughter, brother, sister, father- or mother-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, brother- or sister-in-law,
step-father, or -mother, step-brother, or -sister, step-son, or -daughter, half brother or sister. This presumption
may be rebutted by showing that
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The family members are estranged,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The family ties are remote, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A owns a controlling interest in Corporation X. A's sister-in-law, B, has an attributable interest in a PCS application.
Because A and B have a presumptive kinship affiliation, A's interest in Corporation X is attributable to B, and thus
to the applicant, unless B rebuts the presumption with the necessary showing.

Affiliation through stock ownership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern if he or she owns or controls or has the power
to control 50 percent or more of its voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An applicant is presumed to control or have the power to control a concern even though he or she owns, controls or
has the power to control less than 50 percent of the concern's voting stock, if the block of stock he or she owns, controls
or has the power to control is large as compared with any other outstanding block of stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If two or more persons each owns, controls or has the power to control less than 50 percent of the voting stock of
a concern, such minority holdings are equal or approximately equal in size, and the aggregate of these minority holdings
is large as compared with any other stock holding, the presumption arises that each one of these persons individually
controls or has the power to control the concern; however, such presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such control
or power to control, in fact, does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Affiliation arising under stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Stock options, convertible debentures, and agreements to merge (including agreements in principle) are generally
considered to have a present effect on the power to control the concern. Therefore, in making a size determination,
such options, debentures, and agreements will generally be treated as though the rights held thereunder had been
exercised. However, neither an affiliate nor an applicant can use such options and debentures to appear to terminate
its control over another concern before it actually does so.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If company B holds an option to purchase a controlling interest in company A, who holds an attributable interest in
a PCS application, the situation is treated as though company B had exercised its rights and had become owner of a controlling
interest in company A. The gross revenues of company B must be taken into account in determining the size of the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2 for paragraph (l)(5). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a large company, BigCo, holds 70% (70 of 100 outstanding shares) of the voting stock of company A, who holds an attributable
interest in a PCS application, and gives a third party, SmallCo, an option to purchase 50 of the 70 shares owned by BigCo,
BigCo will be deemed to be an affiliate of company A, and thus the applicant, until SmallCo actually exercises its options
to purchase such shares. In order to prevent BigCo from circumventing the intent of the rule which requires such options
to be considered on a fully diluted basis, the option is not considered to have present effect in this case.

will or to replace the trustee at will.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary,
the stock interests held in trust will be deemed controlled by the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the primary purpose of a voting trust, or similar agreement, is to separate voting power from beneficial ownership
of voting stock for the purpose of shifting control of or the power to control a concern in order that such concern or
another concern may meet the Commission's size standards, such voting trust shall not be considered valid for this
purpose regardless of whether it is or is not recognized within the appropriate jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Affiliation under joint venture arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(i) A joint venture for size determination purposes is an association of concerns and/or individuals, with interests
in any degree or proportion, formed by contract, express or implied, to engage in and carry out a single, specific business
venture for joint profit for which purpose they combine their efforts, property, money, skill and knowledge, but
not on a continuing or permanent basis for conducting business generally. The determination whether an entity is
a joint venture is based upon the facts of the business operation, regardless of how the business operation may be designated
by the parties involved. An agreement to share profits/losses proportionate to each party's contribution to the
business operation is a significant factor in determining whether the business operation is a joint venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposes to revise its regulations which permit agencies to establish temporary
Schedule C positions in order to assist a department or agency head during the period immediately following a change
in presidential administration, when a new department or agency head has entered on duty, or when a new department
or agency is created. Agencies currently differentiate between identical temporary and new temporary Schedule
C positions. They are also subject to an overall limit of new positions they may establish, which was set over 10 years
ago. To simplify the Schedule C appointment process and respond to agency needs, OPM proposes to merge the two temporary
Schedule C authorities into a single temporary appointing authority, and to adjust agencies' position quota to a
more realistic level. OPM is also codifying a requirement in law which deals with the detailing of Schedule C incumbents
to the White House.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, 5 CFR 213.3302 authorizes agencies to establish, without prior OPM approval, temporary Schedule C positions
in order to facilitate the orderly transition of duties during a Presidential transition, changes in department
or agency heads, or changes resulting from the creation of a new department or agency. These temporary positions may
be either (1) identical to existing Schedule C positions (ITC's) if intent to vacate these positions has been put in
writing by management or the present incumbent(s), or (2) new temporary Schedule C positions (NTC's) when it has been
determined that the department or agency heads' needs cannot be met through the establishment of a position identical
to an existing Schedule C position. Individual appointments may be made for up to 120 days, with one extension of an
additional 120 days. It has been OPM policy to permit agencies to make new ITC/NTC appointments up to a year after a Presidential
transition or the agency head comes on board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to maintain a reasonable rate of temporary Schedule C positions within Government, every agency has a quota
of NTC positions it may establish. Current regulations set the limit on the number of NTC positions established by
an agency not to exceed 25 percent of the total number of permanent Schedule C positions authorized for that agency
as of March 31, 1980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations governing temporary Schedule C appointments have been in effect since 1981 and no longer meet agencies'
needs. In addition to general confusion over the distinction between the two types of temporary Schedule C appointments,
some agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to live within a NTC quota that is based on the number of Schedule
C positions that existed over 10 years ago. During 1993, OPM granted several exceptions to individual agency NTC quotas,
by way of a variation under section 5.1 of civil service rule V, to meet agencies' needs. To facilitate the appointment
process and alleviate processing delays, OPM proposes the following changes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
New Temporary Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITC and NTC authorities would be replaced by a single temporary transitional Schedule C (TTC) authority to assist
agencies with their staffing needs during a Presidential transition, changes in agency heads, or at the time a new
agency is created. This new authority will incorporate established policy in effect for ITC and NTC appointments,
such as the time limits for making new appointments (within 1 year after the changeover) and the length of individual
appointments (up to 120 days with one 120-day extension). No prior OPM approval would be required to make appointments,
but agencies would be subject to an overall limit on the number of positions they could fill. Agencies would also have
to notify OPM within 5 working days when a position has been encumbered, and within 3 working days when it has been vacated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agency Quotas
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to maintain a reasonable number of temporary Schedule C positions, the number of temporary transitional
Schedule C positions established by an agency could not exceed either 50 percent of the highest number of permanent
Schedule C positions filled by that agency at any time over the previous 5 years, or three positions, whichever is higher.
This would create a fluctuating quota of positions directly related to the agency's Schedule C activity.

Miscellaneous
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since FY 91, the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act has required agency heads to
certify to OPM, when requesting Schedule C exception, that the agency's Schedule C position was not created solely
or primarily for the purpose of detailing the incumbent to the White House. With the sunset of the Federal Personnel
Manual, we are incorporating this provision of law into the Schedule C regulations. The proposed regulations also
include editorial changes to eliminate an obsolete reference to Schedule C delegation agreements which have not
existed since 1981, and to renumber and change the order of existing paragraphs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also contain a conforming amendment to part 316, section 316.403, which deals with provisional
appointments, to change the terminology of ITC and NTC appointments to temporary transitional.

(a) Upon specific authorization by OPM, agencies may make appointments under this section to positions which are
policy-determining or which involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other
key appointed officials. Positions filled under this authority are excepted from the competitive service and constitute
Schedule C. Each position will be assigned a number from 213.3302 to 213.3999, or other appropriate number, to be used
by the agency in recording appointments made under that authorization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An agency may establish temporary transitional Schedule C positions necessary to assist a department or agency
head during the 1-year period immediately following a change in presidential administration, when a new department
or agency head has entered on duty, or when a new department or agency is created. These positions may be established
only to meet legitimate needs of the agency in carrying out its mission during the period of transition associated
with such changeovers. They must be of a confidential or policy-determining character and are subject to instructions
issued by OPM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The number of temporary transitional Schedule C positions established by an agency cannot exceed either 50 percent
of the highest number of permanent Schedule C positions filled by that agency at any time over the previous 5 years,
or three positions, whichever is higher. In the event a new department or agency is created, the number of temporary
transitional positions should be reasonable in light of the size and program responsibility of that department or
agency.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 737&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal would require various inspections for cracks in the outboard chord of the frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at Body Station (BS) 727 and in the outboard chord of Stringer 18A; and repair or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement of cracked parts. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those outboard chords. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such fatigue cracking, which could result in reduced structural integrity of the outboard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chords, and subsequent rapid decompression of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received several reports of cracking on Boeing Model 737&hyph;100 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&hyph;200 series airplanes in the outboard chord of the frame at Body Station (BS) 727 where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stringer 18A is attached. There also have been reports of cracking in the outboard chord 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Stringer 18A. These cracks were found on eight airplanes that had accumulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 39,000 and 54,100 flight hours, and between 56,200 and 73,200 flight cycles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cracks have been determined to be caused by fatigue that was initiated by fretting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjacent parts. Fatigue cracks in the chords, if not detected and corrected in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner, could result in reduced structural integrity of the structure, and subsequent rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decompression of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
737&hyph;53A1166, dated June 30, 1994, which describes procedures for the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive inspections: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Close visual inspections to detect cracking of the edge of the forward flange of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. High frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspections to detect cracking of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fastener holes in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Pulse echo shear wave (PESW) inspections to detect cracking in the area of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two forward lower fastener holes in the outboard chord where Stringer 18A is attached; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. HFEC inspections to detect cracking of the outboard surface of the outboard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chord of Stringer 18A at Station 727 and of the surface around the heads of two fasteners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for either the installation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-limited repair or the replacement of the chords, if any crack is found in the outboard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chord of the frame at BS 727. (The alert service bulletin references Boeing Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin 737&hyph;53&hyph;1088 as an additional source of service information for replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the outboard chords.) In addition, the alert service bulletin describes procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of a preventative modification, which, when accomplished, eliminates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for repetitive inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections for cracks in the outboard chord of the frame at BS 727 and in the outboard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chord of Stringer 18A; and repair or replacement of cracked parts. The proposed AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would also provide for an optional terminating action for the required inspections. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 999 Boeing Model 737&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 296 airplanes of U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 4 work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours per airplane to accomplish each of the proposed inspections, and that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection requirements of this proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$71,040, or $240 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided by this AD action, it would take approximately 50 work hours to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $3,680 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
optional terminating action is estimated to be $6,680 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Note 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (h) to request approval from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of this AD.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LDOTD), the Coast Guard is considering
a change to the regulation governing the operation of the vertical lift span drawbridge across the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway, mile 35.6, at Larose, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana. The proposed regulation would require that from 7 a.m.
to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, the draw of the bridge would
remain closed to navigation for passage of vehicular traffic during peak traffic periods. At all other times the draw
would open on signal for passage of vessels. Presently, the draw is required to open on signal at all times. This action
would relieve traffic congestion on the bridge during these periods, and still provide for the reasonable needs of
navigation.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has requested the new regulation because vehicular
traffic crossing the bridge during the proposed closure periods has increased dramatically during recent years
and severe congestion occurs during peak traffic hours. The proposed regulation would allow for the uninterrupted
flow of vehicular traffic, while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.

Discussion of Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Louisiana State Route 1 vertical lift span bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 35.6, at Larose,
Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, has 35 feet vertical clearance above mean high water in the closed to navigation position
and 73 feet vertical clearance above mean high water in the open to navigation position. The horizontal clearance
is 125 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of tugs with tows, fishing vessels, sailing vessels, oil field work
boats and recreational craft. Data provided by LDOTD show that from June 1993 through May 1994, the number of vessels
that passed the bridge during the proposed closure period from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. average 1.3 vessels per day. The number
of vessels that passed the bridge during the proposed 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. closure averaged 1.4 vessels per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data show that approximately 658 vehicles cross the bridge during the proposed 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. closure period and
approximately 1,247 vehicles cross the bridge during the proposed 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. closure period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected
to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.
3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

Federalism Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Environment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of
Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA is approving the State's request as a direct final rule without prior proposal, because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If USEPA receives adverse comments, the
direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested
in commenting on this action should do so at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 15, 1994, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued 10 recommendations to the Federal Aviation
Administration as a result of the NTSB's study of commuter airline safety. The FAA is considering rulemaking for each
area where rulemaking is appropriate. In announcing these recommendations, the NTSB stated that the standards for
safety should be based on the characteristics of the flight operations, not the seating capacity of the aircraft and
that passengers on commuter airlines should be afforded the same regulatory safety protections granted to passengers
flying on Part 121 airlines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With this notice, the FAA is soliciting comments on the following recommendations and the FAA's response thereto:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations such that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All scheduled passenger service conducted in aircraft with 20 or more passenger seats be conducted according
to the provisions of 14 CFR Part 121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All scheduled passenger service conducted in aircraft with 10 to 19 passenger seats be conducted in accordance
with 14 CFR Part 121, or its functional equivalent, wherever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Require principal operations inspectors to periodically review air carrier flight operations policies and practices
concerning pilot tasks between flights to ensure that carriers provide pilots with adequate resources (such as time
and personnel) to accomplish those tasks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations contained in 14 CFR Part 135 to require that pilot flight time accumulated
in all company flying conducted after revenue operations *&blank;*&blank;* such as training and check flights,
ferry flights and repositioning flights *&blank;*&blank;* be included in the crewmember's total flight time accrued
during revenue operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Revise within 1 year the pilot training requirements for scheduled Part 135 operators such that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All pilot training for aircraft with 10 or more passenger seats be conducted in accordance with Subparts N and
O of 14 CFR Part 121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All pilots are provided mandatory crew resource management training that incorporates the principal components
of effective CRM training, as outlined in Advisory Circular AC 120&hyph;51A, ``Crew Resource Management Training.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All flightcrew members complete the initial operating experience currently required only of pilots-in-command
under Part 135.244.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Issue within 6 months a final rule of 14 CFR Part 142 concerning the certification and operation of training centers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Revise the certification standards for Part 25 and for Part 23 (commuter category) aircraft to require that a flight
simulator, suitable for flightcrew training under Appendix H of Part 121, be available concurrent with the certification
of any new aircraft type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations to require all flight attendants to participate, during recurrent training,
in emergency drills that allow them the opportunity to use emergency equipment and to practice procedures under simulated
emergency conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Revise the Federal Aviation Regulations to require that all air carriers operating under Parts 121 and 135 establish
a safety function, such as outlined in Advisory Circular AC 120&hyph;59, ``Air Carrier Internal Evaluation Programs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Establish a joint industry/government task force, such as an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC),
comprising representatives from the FAA, air carriers, aircraft manufacturers, and the academic community to review
the qualification standards and training curriculum of air carrier inspectors. The intent of the task force should
be revisions to the qualifying and training standards for air carrier inspectors that will (a) increase their familiarity
with air carrier operations and maintenance in general, as well as the specific operations of the air carriers they
inspect; and (b) enhance their knowledge of the Federal Aviation Regulations and provide for more standardized interpretation
and enforcement of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Enhance the level of safety at airports served by commuter airlines by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Seeking legislative action within 6 months to include in the Airport Certification Program all airports served
by air carriers that provide scheduled passenger service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revising and expanding 14 CFR 135, following enactment of the legislative action described in Safety Recommendation
A&hyph;94&hyph;203, to permit scheduled passenger operation only in airports certificated under the standards
contained in Part 139, ``Certification and Operations: Land Airports Serving Certain Air Carriers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA requests that commenters be as specific as possible and provide as much detail in comments as necessary to facilitate
regulatory decisionmaking. The format that would be most useful to the FAA is a subpart by subpart analysis of the impact
of possible rulemaking. Cost information is also particularly useful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the timeframe recommended by the NTSB, the FAA requests that commenters be timely in their response to this
notice. The agency does not anticipate an extension of the comment period, so that regulatory changes may be proposed
in a responsive timeframe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA anticipates that comments provided in response to this notice will assist the agency in adopting or modifying
the NTSB recommendations to establish a regulatory framework that will enhance safety in the commuter airline industry
while not being overly burdensome on that industry.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to designate critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Strix occidentalis lucida
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), a subspecies federally listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). A total
of 1,931,264 hectares (ha) (4,770,223 acres) of critical habitat is proposed. This proposed critical habitat designation,
if made final, would provide additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities
that are funded, authorized, or carried out by any Federal agency. As information is received by the Service from the
Indian Tribal Governments, the Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Team (Team), Federal and State agencies, and the general
public, revisions may be made to this proposal to incorporate that new information. In addition, section 4 of the Act
requires the Service to consider economic impact and any other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on
the size and scope of critical habitat. An economic analysis is currently being prepared and notice of its availability
will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Summary of Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to designate critical habitat on certain lands in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado, which
now provide habitat or may provide habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, and that are managed for timber harvest. The
Team has developed a draft Recovery Plan that identifies commercial timber harvest as the main management regime
presenting a threat to Mexican spotted owl habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 14, 1994, certain environmental groups and an individual filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in
Arizona against the Department of the Interior for failure to designate critical habitat for the Mexican spotted
owl.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CIV&hyph;94&hyph;0337&hyph;PHX&hyph;CAM. On October 6, 1994, the Court ordered the Service to, ``publish a proposed
designation of critical habitat, including economic exclusion pursuant to 16 U.S.C. Sec. 1533(b)(2), no later than
December 1, 1994, *&blank;*&blank;* [and] publish its final designation of critical habitat, following the procedure
required by statute and Federal regulations for notice and comment, no later than May 27, 1995.'' The Service plans
to review the information which has been assembled and analyzed by the Team as it makes final determination about designation
of critical habitat. It is anticipated that the draft recovery plan will be available for public review and comment
in December 1994.

The Service is also pursuing conservation agreements and management programs with various Indian Tribal Governments
and the U.S. Forest Service. If agreements can be reached and implementation ensured so that special management consideration
or protection is not necessary, the Service may consider excluding those areas from critical habitat. Such management
agreements should include commitments to implementation of the recovery plan for the species or equivalent protection.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mexican spotted owl is a medium-sized bird ranging from parts of central Colorado and Utah, south through Arizona,
New Mexico, and western Texas, then south through Mexico to the States of Michoacan and Puebla. Mexican spotted owl
habitat typically consists of dense, multi-storied, montane forests with closed canopies, and deep, cool, fractured
canyons. The Mexican spotted owl is threatened by destruction and modification of habitat caused by even-aged timber
harvest methods and wildfires, and decreased habitat suitability and potential increased predation associated
with habitat fragmentation.

The entire spotted owl species (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strix occidentalis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was classified on the Service's 1989 Animal Notice of Review (54 FR 554; January 6, 1989) as a category 2 species. A
category 2 species is one for which listing may be appropriate, but for which additional biological information is
needed to support a proposed rule. The northern spotted owl subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. o. caurina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was listed as a threatened species on June 26, 1990 (55 FR 26194), and its critical habitat was designated on January
15, 1992 (57 FR 1796). The California spotted owl subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. o. occidentalis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) remains a category 2 candidate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 22, 1989, the Service received a petition submitted by Dr. Robin D. Silver requesting the listing of the
Mexican spotted owl as an endangered or threatened species under the Act. On February 27, 1990, the Service found that
the petition presented substantial information indicating that listing may be warranted and initiated a status
review. In conducting its review, the Service published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 11413) on March 28, 1990, requesting public comments and biological data on the status of the Mexican spotted
owl. On December 6, 1990, the Mexican Spotted Owl Status Review Team completed a draft report, and on February 20, 1991,
the Service made a finding, based on the contents of the report, that listing the Mexican spotted owl pursuant to section
4(b)(3)(B)(i) of the Act was warranted. Notice of this finding was published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 11, 1991 (56 FR 14678). A proposed rule to list the Mexican spotted owl as threatened without critical habitat
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 4, 1991 (56 FR 56344). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the November 4, 1991, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might bear on whether the Mexican spotted owl should be listed. The comment period
was reopened from May 11, 1992, to September 1, 1992 (57 FR 20073; May 11, 1992) to allow submission of additional comments.
Appropriate State agencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested
parties were directly contacted and requested to comment, and newspaper notices inviting public comment were published
in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The Service held six public hearings, which were announced in the proposed
rule. A notice of the hearing dates and locations was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 2, 1992 (57 FR 35), and in notices published in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado newspapers. Interested
parties were directly contacted and notified of the hearings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a review of all comments received in response to the proposed rule, the Service published a final rule to list
the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14248). Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires
that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species
is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical
habitat is not determinable if information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts of the designation
is lacking or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an
area as critical habitat. At the time of listing, the Service found that, although considerable knowledge of Mexican
spotted owl habitat needs had been gathered in recent years, habitat maps in sufficient detail to accurately delineate
these areas were not available. Subsequent to listing, the Service began gathering the data necessary to develop
this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 25, 1993, and again on August 16, 1993, the Service received petitions to remove the Mexican spotted owl from
the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (delist). In subsequent petition findings published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 49467, 59 FR 15361) the Service addressed the issues raised in the petitions and determined that the petitioners
did not present substantial information indicating that delisting the Mexican spotted owl was warranted. The petitioners

The physical and biological habitat features essential to the conservation of the Mexican spotted owl, referred
to as the primary constituent elements, include those that support nesting, roosting, foraging, and dispersal.
These elements were determined from studies of Mexican spotted owl habitat, including habitat structure, habitat
use, and prey preferences, throughout the range of the owl.

The vegetative communities and structural attributes used by the Mexican spotted owl vary across its range. The vegetative
communities consist primarily of warm-temperate and cold-temperate forests, and, to a lesser extent, woodlands
and riparian deciduous forests. The mixed-conifer community appears to be most frequently used in portions of its
range (Skaggs and Raitt 1988; Ganey and Balda 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mixed-conifer forests contain several species of overstory trees. The most common are white fir (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The understory within mixed-conifer communities provides important roosting sites for Mexican spotted owls. The
understory usually contains the same conifer species found in the overstory, with Gambel oak (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

In southeastern Arizona, owl habitat types include mixed-conifer and Madrean Evergreen Forest and Woodland (Ganey
and Balda 1989; Duncan and Taiz 1992). Below the mixed-conifer vegetative zone are found two series of Madrean Evergreen
Woodland: the upper oak-pine occurs at 1,675 to 2,200 meters (5,500 to 7,200 feet), and the lower evergreen oak (encinal)
occurs at 1,525 to 1,980 meters (5,000 to 6,500 feet). Within these vegetative zones, and particularly at lower elevations,
Mexican spotted owls are usually found in steep, forested canyons with rocky cliffs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the northern edge of their range in northeastern Arizona, southwestern Colorado, and southern Utah, Mexican spotted
owls occur during the breeding season between 1,340 and 2,160 meters (4,400 to 7,100 feet) in canyon habitats within
pinyon-juniper woodland (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pinus edulis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Juniperus osteosperma
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or mixed-conifer forests. Canyon habitat is characterized by the cool, humid conditions found in the deep, steep-walled,
fractured structures of sandstone slickrock. Canyons frequently contain riparian and conifer pockets, and adjacent
slopes and mesa tops are vegetated by a variety of plant associations. Although no studies have been completed, preliminary
studies show most Mexican spotted owl activity during the breeding season occuring within and adjacent to canyons.
Owls roost in the riparian and coniferous pockets of canyon bottoms, on ledges, or in cavities in the slickrock canyon
walls (Guti&eacute;rrez and Rinkevich 1991; van Riper and Willey 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Characteristics associated with forested Mexican spotted owl habitat usually develop with increasing forest age,
but their occurrence may vary by location, past forest management practices, forest type, and productivity. Although
Mexican spotted owl habitat is variable over its range, some general attributes are common to the subspecies' life-history
requirements throughout its range. The attributes of nesting and roosting habitat typically include a moderate
to high canopy closure (60 to 80 percent); a multi-layered canopy with large overstory trees of various species; a
high incidence of large trees with various deformities (e.g., large cavities, broken tops, mistletoe infections,
and other evidence of decadence); large snags; accumulations of fallen trees and other woody debris on the ground;
and sufficient open space below the canopy for owls to fly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forest habitat characteristics are best expressed in older mixed-conifer forests. These characteristics may also
develop in younger stands, especially when the stands contain remnant large trees or patches of large trees from earlier
stands. Certain forest management practices may also enhance tree growth and mature stand characteristics where
the older, larger trees are allowed to persist. Ganey and Balda (1988) found an average of 402 ha (995 acres) of old-growth
forest within the 847 ha (2,092 acre) average home range for 3 pairs of radio-monitored owls in northern Arizona. Fletcher
(1990) reported an average of 62 ha (154 acres) of old-growth forest and an average of 465 ha (1,149 acres) of suitable
habitat within the management territories established by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) for 359 Mexican spotted
owl sites in Arizona and New Mexico. Mexican spotted owl use of old growth may vary greatly among regional habitat types,
forest types, and elevational ranges.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forest habitat required for Mexican spotted owl nesting and roosting appears to be more restricted than that required
for foraging. Ganey and Balda (1994) found significant owl selectivity in habitat use in a comparison of the habitat
characteristics of roosting, foraging, and randomly available sites. Roosting sites had larger logs, greater canopy
cover, and higher densities and basal areas of both trees and snags than foraging sites and random sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spotted owls apparently use a wider array of habitat types for foraging than for nesting and roosting, including fairly
open and non-contiguous forest, small openings, pure ponderosa pine forests, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Use of
these components may be determined by their availability and by their proximity to the more characteristic habitat
attributes previously described. However, Ganey and Balda (1994) found a greater selectivity in habitat used for
foraging than for random sample sites. As did roosting sites, foraging areas had larger logs, greater canopy cover,
and higher densities and basal areas of both trees and snags than random sites. Owls also consistently avoided foraging
in forests in which the overstory had been partially harvested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little is known about the habitat requirements for dispersal. Habitat that meets the species' needs for nesting and
roosting may also provide for foraging and dispersal. However, habitat that supports foraging or dispersal does
not always provide constituent elements required for nesting and roosting. The definition of the term ``dispersal''
is frequently limited to post-fledging movements of juveniles. For the purposes of this rule, the Service considers
the term to include all movement, including winter shifts in territory and dispersal from natal areas, and to encompass
the important biological concepts of connectivity within and between clusters of Mexican spotted owl territories.
Although habitat that allows for dispersal may be marginal or unsuitable for nesting or roosting, it provides connectivity
between blocks of nesting habitat both locally and over the Mexican spotted owl's range that is essential to demographic
interaction and genetic flow. Thus, dispersal habitat includes unoccupied habitat of varying quality that may support
intermittent use as a ``stepping stone'' between occupied areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mexican spotted owls occur in relatively isolated mountain ranges, often separated by wide expanses of Sonoran,
Chihuahuan, and Great Basin desert and other nonforested lands. Preliminary studies of juvenile owl dispersal in
southern Utah (Willey 1993) and New Mexico (Peter Stacey, University of Nevada, Reno, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993) have shown movements across a wide variety of habitat types, including both riparian areas and vegetation types
considered too open for consistent use by Mexican spotted owls. In Southern Arizona, spotted owls occur in isolated
clusters separated by desert habitat. It is probable that these small clusters are not self-sustaining, but depend
on immigration from other areas to maintain demographic and genetic viability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of a 3-year telemetry study of owls and habitat in southern Utah indicate seasonal shifts in habitat use
(van Riper and Willey 1992, Willey 1993). During the breeding season, about 25 percent of adult owl locations occurred
outside of steep canyon terrain. During the fall and winter seasons, about half of the locations occurred on mesa-tops,
benches, and warm slopes above the canyons. Movement out of the relatively cool canyons used in summer months to warmer
areas used in winter may be related to the thermoregulatory requirements of the species. Movements out of the summer
home ranges during the winter season were highly variable. A few owls moved completely out of their summer ranges,
several shifted into adjacent areas with some overlap of seasonal ranges, and others remained within the same area
year round.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal, State, tribal, and private lands contain habitat for the owl. Federal agencies involved include the Forest
Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Department
of Defense. Tribes include the Navajo, San Carlos Apache, White Mountain Apache, Southern Ute, Jicarilla Apache,
Hualapai, and the Mescalero Apache. Efforts to estimate habitat acreage and survey effort for owls have varied among
agencies and tribes, with the most intensive work being done by the Forest Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, land-managing agencies characterize Mexican spotted owl habitat under the term ``suitable.'' Suitable
habitat is often identified only as habitat able to sustain the combined nesting, roosting, and foraging needs of
the Mexican spotted owl. The definition often excludes additional habitat used only for foraging and may underestimate
the total habitat available within an owl territory and across the species' range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forest Service land in Arizona and New Mexico contains 1,267,000 ha (3,130,000 acres) of suitable habitat, with an
additional 421,000 ha (1,040,000 acres) described as being capable of returning to suitable condition (L. Henson,
Southwest Regional Forester,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Forest Service land in Colorado is estimated to have about 356,000 ha (880,000 acres) of forested suitable
habitat. Recent estimates of suitable canyon habitat in Utah national forests is about 58,000 ha (143,000 acres)
(Kate Grandison, Dixie National Forest,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1994). No capable acreage figure is available for Utah and Colorado. Combining all Forest Service suitable habitat
with the capable habitat in the Southwest Region (Arizona and New Mexico) yields a total of habitat acreage of 2,102,000
ha (5,193,000 acres) on Forest Service lands in the four-State area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service began Mexican spotted owl inventories in New Mexico and Arizona in 1988. Inventories began in Colorado
in 1989, and in Utah in 1990. About 1,012,000 ha (2,500,000 acres) had been inventoried in the Forest Service Southwest
Region as of the end of the 1993 survey season (USFS 1993). Utah and Colorado national forests have inventoried 354,000
ha (875,000 acres) and about 202,000 ha (500,000 acres), respectively (K. Grandison,

The Southwestern Region of the Forest Service establishes areas around known owl locations, called management territories
(MTs). Each MT represents the occurrence of either a single owl or pair of owls, and is based on either confirmed nest
or roost locations, or nighttime calling responses. Forest Service inventories through 1993 resulted in the establishment
of 740 MTs in Arizona and New Mexico (Heather Hollis, Forest Service Southwest Regional Office, pers. comm., 1994).
Four MTs have been established from the six sites with owl detection records in Utah (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994).
No MTs have been established for the six owl sites in Colorado (John Verner, Pike/San Isabel National Forests, pers.
comm., 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is potentially up to 435,000 ha (1,075,000 acres) of Mexican spotted owl habitat on Indian reservations. The
actual amount of habitat may be lower because estimates supplied by the BIA Forestry Division were developed from
timber-type maps containing little information about understory conditions or slope. The estimates may also omit
minimally forested or nonforested canyon habitat acreage. Information available to the Service on owl survey efforts
on Indian lands is as follows:

Most Mexican spotted owl habitat in national parks and monuments consists of minimally forested, steep, shaded canyons
in the northern part of the owl's range. It is difficult to estimate acreage for this type of habitat. The NPS estimated
that 23 parks and monuments in the Southwest contained between 96,000 and 177,000 ha (238,000 to 438,000 acres) of
Mexican spotted owl habitat (NPS, Southwest Region,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between 72,000 and 82,000 ha (177,000 to 202,000 acres) of New Mexico and Arizona State lands contain forests and canyons
that could be suitable Mexican spotted owl habitat. Several historical and recent records exist for New Mexico State
lands. In Arizona, surveys conducted by the Arizona State Land Department and the Coconino National Forest resulted
in the establishment of three MTs on Forest Service land. No information was available on suitable Mexican spotted
owl habitat on State lands in Utah and Colorado. However, a single owl was recorded on Utah State lands in 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Private lands in Arizona and New Mexico are currently estimated to contain up to 53,000 ha (130,000 acres) of owl habitat
(U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). No estimates exist for owl habitat acreage on private lands in Colorado and
Utah. This is partly due to the difficulty in assessing the extent of existing canyon habitat in the Colorado Plateau
physiographic province, and partly a result of the insufficient amount of owl surveys accomplished to accurately
determine the limit of the species' range.

The land-managing agencies and tribes estimate a total of 3,100,000 ha (7,666,000 acres) of suitable Mexican spotted
owl habitat within the United States. These estimates of habitat availability for nesting and roosting activity
are derived from median figures where estimates were given as an acreage range and include capable habitat estimates
where available. The approximate proportion of Mexican spotted owl habitat in the Southwest is: Forest Service,
68 percent; Tribal, 14 percent; BLM, 10 percent; NPS, 4 percent; the States of Arizona and New Mexico, 2 percent; and
private lands, 2 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The percentage of habitat for each category of ownership is considered fairly accurate. However, the total acreage
of owl habitat is likely overestimated. The error is a consequence of inadequate information on land status and questions
about the types of vegetative communities that provide owl habitat. Several agencies expressed uncertainty about
the accuracy of their habitat estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service estimates that there is approximately 2,425,000 ha (5,988,000 acres) of owl habitat suitable for nesting
and roosting. This estimate excludes most of the ponderosa pine community type because this vegetation type is not
significantly used by nesting and roosting Mexican spotted owls. However, the Forest Service does consider ponderosa
pine forest to be suitable habitat when it has the correct structural attributes (K.W. Fletcher, Forest Service Southwest
Region, pers. comm., 1992), but the forest stand maps and inventory databases do not separate suitable from unsuitable
stands in ponderosa pine. Forest Service Mexican spotted owl inventory data place approximately 50 MTs in ponderosa
pine habitat, which would add about 40,000 ha (100,000 acres) to the suitable habitat base in Arizona and New Mexico

Definition of Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is required to base critical habitat proposals upon the best scientific and commercial data available
and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular
area as critical habitat. The Service may exclude areas from critical habitat designation when the benefits of exclusion
outweigh the benefits of including the areas within critical habitat, provided the exclusion will not result in the
extinction of the species (Section 4(b)(2) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat is defined in Section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: ``(i) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied
by a species .&blank;.&blank;. on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation
of the species, and (II) that may require special management considerations or protection; and (ii) specific areas
outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed .&blank;.&blank;. upon a determination
by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' The term ``conservation,''
as defined in Section 3(3) of the Act, means ``.&blank;.&blank;. to use and the use of all methods and procedures which
are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the point at which the measures provided pursuant
to this Act are no longer necessary,'' i.e., the species is recovered and can be removed from the list of endangered
and threatened species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Role in Species Conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed designation of critical habitat includes areas subject to commercial timber harvest, the primary threat
to the species. The Service considers the protections that result from the listing of the species as threatened, such
as the jeopardy prohibition under section 7 and the prohibition of take under section 9 of the Act, to be adequate protection
in areas where other, localized threats may be present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should
identify lands that may be needed for a species' eventual recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat
is proposed or designated at the time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know precisely what may be
needed for recovery. In this regard, critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery.
The Service is continuing to work with the Recovery Team to determine those areas and management approaches considered
necessary for the recovery and conservation of the species.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to recovery, but, through regulations under section
7 of the Act, may assist the Service and all Federal agencies in contributing toward the species' conservation. Critical
habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary
constituent elements), regardless of whether they are currently occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the
public and land-managing agencies to the importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical habitat
also identifies areas that may require special management considerations or protection, and provides additional
protection to areas where significant threats to the species have been identified. Critical habitat receives protection
from destruction or adverse modification through required consultation under section 7 of the Act with regard to
actions carried out, funded, or authorized by a Federal agency. Section 7 also requires conferences on Federal actions
that are likely to result in the adverse modification or destruction of proposed critical habitat. Aside from the
added protection provided under section 7, the Act does not provide other forms of protection to lands designated
as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan for a listed species. Designation does not establish
numerical population goals, prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside of critical habitat), nor
does it have a direct effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management recommendations for
critical habitat are most appropriately addressed in recovery plans, management plans, and through section 7 consultation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the conservation of a species. Areas not currently containing
all of the essential features, but with the capability to do so in the future, may also be essential for the long-term
recovery of the species, particularly in certain portions of its range, and may be designated as critical habitat.
However, not all areas containing the features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to a species'
survival. Areas not included within critical habitat boundaries that contain one or more of the primary constituent
elements are still important to a species' conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act, and other
conservation laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The steps used to determine proposed critical habitat are summarized in the following sections on Primary Constituent
Elements, and Criteria for Identifying Candidate Critical Habitat Units.

Primary Constituent Elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining which areas to propose as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological attributes
that are essential to a species' conservation and which may require special management considerations or protection
(section 3(5)(A)(i), of the Act). Such physical and biological attributes are described in 50 CFR 424.12. They include,
but are not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Food, water, or other nutritional or physiological requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cover or shelter; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sites for breeding, reproduction, or rearing of offspring; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical and ecological
distributions of a species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl are those areas that include, but
are not limited to, the habitat components which provide or which have the potential to provide for nesting, roosting,
foraging, or dispersal. Forested habitats used for nesting and roosting are typically characterized as supporting
mature stand attributes including high canopy closure, multi-canopied structure, coniferous vegetation (sometimes
including a hardwood understory), large diameter trees, high densities of live trees, snags and large logs. Canyon
habitats for nesting and roosting are generally sparsely vegetated, steep-walled areas, often containing rock
outcrops and crevices. Nesting and roosting habitat also supports owl foraging activity; however, a wider array
of habitat attributes may be found in areas used solely for foraging and/or dispersal, including fairly open and non-contiguous
forest, small openings, woodlands, and rocky slopes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Areas of proposed critical habitat include both ``suitable'' and ``unsuitable'' forest habitat. Several definitions
of ``suitable'' are currently used by different land-managing agencies; however, the term ``suitable'' generally
refers to habitat that supports the combined activities of nesting, roosting, and foraging. In the Southwest, ``suitable''
habitat is often interpersed with ``unsuitable'' habitat that may be important for foraging. This critical habitat
proposal is not limited to habitat that meets ``suitable'' definitions, but includes habitat with any of the primary
constituent elements described above.

Criteria for Identifying Candidate Critical Habitat Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary objective in proposing critical habitat is to identify existing and potential Mexican spotted owl habitat
considered essential for the conservation of the species, and in need of special management considerations or protection.
The Service has focused on available nesting and roosting habitat to identify locales that provide a nucleus for delineation
of critical habitat units. Additional habitat was added as needed to develop units based on the criteria described
below. In its proposal of critical habitat, the Service has considered all habitat types needed by the species through
its definition of the primary constituent elements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using aerial photography, Mexican spotted owl habitat and forest type maps, and field verification, the Service
identified areas to be considered for designation as critical habitat. Because habitat maps available to the Service
were generally based on the varying definitions of ``suitable habitat'' used by the agencies, the major focus was
on habitat that provides nesting, roosting, and some foraging attributes. To assist in these determinations, the
Service relied upon the following principles developed by the Interagency Scientific Committee (Thomas

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several qualitative criteria were considered when determining whether to select specific areas as potential critical
habitat. The following discussion describes the criteria and provides an explanation of their use in selecting specific
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Currently Suitable Habitat: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service concentrated on the existence of currently suitable Mexican spotted owl forested habitat (primarily
nesting and roosting, but also foraging) that contains one or more of the primary constituent elements. The Service
evaluated the quality of existing habitat based on available habitat maps and delineated the best available habitat
(i.e., the least fragmented, most contiguous forest habitat) in the critical habitat units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Large Contiguous Blocks of Habitat: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service identified, where available, large, contiguous blocks of habitat or areas that mostly consist of Mexican
spotted owl habitat. Areas were selected so that critical habitat units would include as little low-quality habitat
as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dispersal Distances: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The widely-spaced nature of most Mexican spotted owl territory clusters generally determined the distances between
proposed critical habitat units. However, where a unit was developed to provide additional unoccupied habitat to
enhance the probability of cluster persistence, units were oriented to minimize inter-unit distances and facilitate
potential dispersal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupied Habitat: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating potential critical habitat units, the Service gave primary consideration to habitat currently occupied
by pairs or resident singles; however, some unoccupied areas were selected if they were important for other reasons
(e.g., territory cluster contiguity and linkage). The Service may designate unoccupied areas when such areas are
essential for the conservation of the species (section 3(5)(A)(ii) of the Act). Some units were selected based on
habitat suitability although no surveys had yet been conducted. All areas selected, however, have potential for
supporting Mexican spotted owls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rangewide Distribution: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service is proposing critical habitat units throughout the existing United States range of the Mexican spotted
owl to maintain genetic variation and cluster linkage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Management or Protection: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(5)(A)(i)(II) of the Act defines critical habitat as areas ``which may require special management considerations
or protection.'' The Service evaluated the need for special management in terms of the existing situation (e.g.,
current quality of existing habitat), the relative importance of territory clusters, or current management activities,
and threats. For example, the Fort Apache Indian Reservation is managed under an uneven-age timber harvest prescription,
unlike the even-age management cited as a threat to the Mexican spotted owl. The White Mountain Apache Tribe has developed
a conservation strategy that the Service believes will adequately protect the Mexican spotted owl on the Fort Apache
Indian Reservation. Thus, the Service has determined that additional special management consideration or protection
is not needed, and the area is not proposed as critical habitat. All other areas selected are included in this proposal
because of their need for special management or protection. However, the Forest Service and other Indian tribes have
begun work with the Service to develop and implement conservation agreements or management plans to conduct timber
harvests while providing adequate protection to the owl and its habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Service evaluated the adequacy of existing protection under the Act to determine whether critical
habitat would provide a necessary incremental benefit to the species. For example, significant protection already
exists under section 7 of the Act, such as the prohibition of jeopardy to the species, the minimization of project impacts
through mandatory reasonable and prudent measures to minimize incidental take, etc. The Service considers commercial
timber harvest to be the primary threat to the Mexican spotted owl, and thus identified areas (proposed critical habitat
units) where commercial timber harvest is planned or authorized. In those areas, the designation of critical habitat
can provide protection above the current protection under the Act by protecting unoccupied habitat. It is important
to note, however, that other areas are essential to the species' recovery, and their exclusion from proposed critical
habitat designation does not imply otherwise. Although other threats to Mexican spotted owls have been mentioned,
such as oil and gas leasing, grazing, recreation, etc., the Service has been unable to find evidence that these threats
are significant to the Mexican spotted owl population as a whole. Rather, these activities are best dealt with through
section 7 consultation on the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service considered the existing legal status of areas (i.e., reserved areas such as wilderness or parks) and has
not proposed reserved areas as critical habitat. In general, the current classification of wilderness areas and
parks provides adequate protection against potential habitat-altering activities because they are primarily
managed as natural ecosystems. These lands are often essential to the conservation of the species, as they provide
important links and contain large areas of habitat in relatively pristine condition. However, these lands by themselves
do not provide adequate habitat to support a viable range-wide Mexican spotted owl population. The Service considered
their relative contribution to the Mexican spotted owl's conservation but generally did not include them in critical
habitat because of their current classification unless they were inclusions within larger surrounding critical
habitat units.

Proposed Critical Habitat Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has identified 112 proposed critical habitat units totaling 1,931,264 ha (4,770,223 acres) in Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado. The approximate acreage of proposed critical habitat by land ownership is shown in
Table 1.

Forest Practices

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Management direction for lands with Mexican spotted owl habitat varies within and between Tribal governments and
Federal and State agencies. A management emphasis for timber production is in effect on much of Forest Service and
tribally managed land. Some BLM Mexican spotted owl habitat is managed primarily for natural resources extraction,
including timber, but is still available for wildlife and recreation. National Park Service lands are managed for
recreation and preservation of natural values. State lands within owl habitat are typically checkerboarded with
Federal lands and are usually not large enough to support owl territories of their own. State lands are managed with
similar resource management emphases as BLM land. Management emphasis on private lands providing Mexican spotted
owl habitat is unknown.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Although the Forest Service is undergoing a process to change its dominant silvicultural practices to uneven age
systems, its current management plans call for harvestable timberland in Arizona and New Mexico to be primarily managed
under an even-aged system using shelterwood management. Commercial forests on the Navajo Indian Reservation have
also been managed under shelterwood prescriptions (James Carter, BIA, pers. comm., 1990). Other commercial forests
on Indian lands in the Southwest are managed primarily as uneven-aged stands by use of selective logging. Under the
shelterwood system, a stand is scheduled for a series of harvests culminating in a full rotation cycle in 120 years
or less. This cycle length maximizes timber production, but does not provide enough time for stands to reach the mature
to old-growth conditions characteristic of forested Mexican spotted owl habitat, and results in forest age distributions
unnaturally skewed toward younger stands. The conversion of complexly structured forest stands to evenaged stands
was identified by the Service (USFWS 1991, USFWS 1993) as the greatest threat facing the Mexican spotted owl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has determined habitat loss trends from current National Forest plans, which provide the only available
projections on timber harvest trends into the future. Half of all shelterwood management on National Forests is occurring
in forests not suitable for breeding (primarily pure ponderosa pine), and the other half in suitable forest habitat.
The Forest Plans project that an estimated 0.4 percent of Mexican spotted owl habitat will be made unsuitable for breeding
each year in the future if timber extraction continues as outlined under current forest plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uneven-aged management like that employed by the White Mountain Apache Tribe maintains and promotes development
of complex forest structures. Methods include individual tree selection and group selection. Individual tree selection
entails the harvest of trees selected from a size-distribution curve appropriate for forest type, site conditions,
and desired regeneration levels. Trees of various size and age classes are retained, and multi-storied attributes
and vertical diversity are maintained. Group selection creates openings in the forest stand up to a hectare (1 to 2
acres) in size, developing small even-aged clumps of trees and within-stand horizontal diversity. The Service considers
the use of uneven-age management the silvicultural method most compatible with maintenance of Mexican spotted owl
habitat.

The States of Arizona, Utah, and Colorado list the Mexican spotted owl as a threatened species. Capture, handling,
transportation, and take of Mexican spotted owls are regulated by game laws and special licenses for live wildlife.
These State laws and licensing requirements regulate hunting, recreation, and scientific investigation. Habitat
protection is not provided through State laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is aware of Mexican spotted owl protection guidelines that have been developed by two Indian nations.
The guidelines for the Mescalero Apache Reservation establish a 29 ha (72 acre) buffer zone around active Mexican
spotted owl roost or nest sites. No management activities may occur within the buffer zone during the reproductive
season. After the reproductive season, the buffer is reduced to a 46-meter (150-foot) radius encompassing 0.66 ha
(1.6 acres) around significant roost areas and a 61-meter (200-foot) radius encompassing 1.17 ha (2.9 acres) around
nests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Fort Apache Indian Reservation is managed under a conservation plan approved by the Tribal Council. This plan
designates two levels of owl protection. The first level protects clusters of owls and their intervening habitat,
and the second level focuses on individual owl sites. This management strategy is largely based on a landscape rather
than site-by-site approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most Federal agencies have policies to protect State-listed threatened or endangered species, and some agencies
also protect species that are candidates for Federal listing. For instance, the NPS Organic Act protects all wildlife
on national parks and monuments. However, general policies often do not include standards and guidelines to measure
policy success. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to listing, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) provided the only Federal protection for the Mexican spotted
owl. Under the provisions of the MBTA, it is unlawful to pursue, hunt, take, capture, or kill in any manner any migratory
bird unless permitted by regulations. Although the Mexican spotted owl typically remains in its summer range throughout
the year, it is included on the list of birds protected under the MBTA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interagency agreement for purpose of ensuring population viability of the spotted owl (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strix occidentalis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), including the Mexican spotted owl, was signed by the Service, BLM, NPS, and Forest Service on August 12, 1988 (U.S.
Department of Interior 1988). Under this agreement, each agency agreed to manage its lands to provide owl habitat,
to carry out habitat and population inventories sufficient to assess long-term trends, and to carry out research
activities sufficient to provide empirical information on the validity of planning assumptions. The degree to which
this agreement has been implemented has varied within and among agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific management policies for the Mexican spotted owl have been developed by the BLM in Colorado and New Mexico.
The policy in Colorado states, ``In areas with a confirmed nest or roost site, surface management activities will
be limited and will be determined on a case by case basis to allow as much flexibility as possible outside of the core
area.'' Management policy in New Mexico states that habitat core areas and territories of appropriate size will be
established and preserved wherever Mexican spotted owls are found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detailed guidelines for Mexican spotted owl management have been developed by the Forest Service Southwest Region.
The guidelines were first issued as Mexican spotted owl Interim Directive (ID) No. 1 in June 1989, and reissued as Mexican
spotted owl ID No. 2 in June 1990. Utah and Colorado national forests adopted ID No. 2 in 1991. The guidelines expired
December 26, 1991, but the Forest Service is continuing to manage under ID No. 2. The IDs require establishment of a
Mexican spotted owl MT around each nest or roost site. Each MT (except those on the Gila and Lincoln National Forests)
has a core area of 182 ha (450 acres) and an overall size of 810 ha (2,000 acres). Activities within the core area are limited
to road construction. Within the MT, activities, including timber harvest, are limited to a maximum of 314 ha (775
acres). The intent of the guidelines is to retain at least 405 ha (1,000 acres) of suitable habitat within the MT after
proposed management activities are identified and located. Forest Service estimates indicate that suitable habitat
within MTs currently averages 466 ha (1,150 acres) for territories in New Mexico and Arizona. In Utah, MTs encompass
1,340 ha (3,350 acres) with a core of 350 ha (875 acres) (K. Grandison, pers. comm., 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the IDs has not been uniform on all forests. Guidelines on two forests were modified. The core area was
reduced in size to 121 ha (300 acres) for the Lincoln National Forest under ID No. 1. Under ID No. 2, a core area of 182 ha
(450 acres) was established for all forests but the overall territory size was reduced to 607 ha (1,500 acres) for the
Lincoln and Gila National Forests. Both forests have significant Mexican spotted owl populations, which has resulted
in conflicts with timber harvest plans. The ID provides no protection for unoccupied suitable Mexican spotted owl
habitat, nor does it address forest activities not related to timber harvest.

The Service has examined spotted owl protective measures throughout the species' range. The management strategies
employed by various agencies and tribes have been developed independently without a common overall approach. These
strategies provide varying levels of protection to existing owl sites, but most do not conform to an overall, landscape
recovery strategy. In addition, there has been no assessment of the adequacy of these varied approaches in promoting
range-wide conservation of the Mexican spotted owl. Thus the Service has determined that the designation of critical
habitat in areas subject to timber harvest will help to preserve options until a long-term, range-wide management
strategy is developed and its implementation ensured.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service appointed the Team in March 1993. Since that time the Team has assembled all available data on Mexican spotted
owl biology, the threats faced across the species' range, current protection afforded the species, etc. Using that
information, the Team developed the Draft Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan. Availability of that document will
be announced in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft Mexican Spotted Owl Recovery Plan recommends a landscape management strategy that will conserve the species
as population and habitat trends are assessed. If made final, the recovery plan will guide management of this species
over the next 10&hyph;15 years. The Service will assess the value of critical habitat in implementing the recovery
plan, and that assessment may influence the final critical habitat rulemaking.

Section 7 Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation to designate critical habitat, a brief description
and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by
such designation. Regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat
as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival
and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying
any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely
to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies, and is in addition to,
the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued
existence of any listed species. As required by 50 CFR 402.14, a Federal agency must consult with the Service if it determines
an action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Thus, the requirement to consider adverse modification
of critical habitat is an incremental section 7 consideration above and beyond section 7 review to evaluate jeopardy
and incidental take of the species. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act
are found at 50 CFR 402.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conference on Current Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(4) of the Act and 50 CFR 402.10 of the regulations require Federal agencies to confer with the Service
on any action that is likely to result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. The Act
requires Federal agencies to reinitiate consultation on previously reviewed actions should conditions change
(e.g., if the Service designates critical habitat); consequently, some Federal agencies may request conference
with the Service on actions for which formal consultation has been completed. Conference reports provide conservation
recommendations to assist the agency in eliminating conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action. The conservation
recommendations in a conference report are advisory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, the Service may issue a formal conference report. Formal conference
reports on proposed critical habitat contain a biological opinion that is prepared according to 50 CFR 402.14, as
if critical habitat were designated. The Service may adopt the formal conference report as the biological opinion
when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information or changes in the action alter the content
of the opinion (see 50 CFR 402.10(d)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Examples of Proposed Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Areas which contain habitat used by the owl during its life cycle support a number of existing, proposed, and potential
activities. Commercial activities that may affect Mexican spotted owl critical habitat include timber harvest,
timber salvage harvest, other wood fiber utilization (e.g., paper, firewood), snag removal, construction of hydroelectric
facilities, and construction of ski areas and resort facilities. Additional activities include ``personal use''
commodity production, such as fuelwood gathering and Christmas tree cutting. Activities associated with land management
by involved agencies include campground and road construction, certain fire suppression activities such as fire
break construction and use of chemical fire retardants; silvicultural activities such as forest pest management
and stocking control; and military maneuvers. The Service recognizes that these activities may affect individual
owls and portions of their habitat. However, the Service has identified the timber management program as the activity
that constitutes the most significant threat to the survival of the species because of its scope across the landscape,
and because it is the predominant threat to habitat in the areas with the largest owl populations. The Service believes
that where there are other activities section 7 consultations on effects of projects to the species and other regulatory
mechanisms provide adequate protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating proposed activities within critical habitat through section 7 analyses, the Service uses project
descriptions and biological assessments provided by the action agency, and focuses on the likely impacts of a project
on the constituent elements of the site and surrounding areas. The Federal agencies requesting consultation can
assist the Service in its evaluation of proposed actions by providing detailed information on the habitat configuration
of a project area, habitat conditions of surrounding areas, and information on known locations of Mexican spotted
owls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed actions would be individually examined in terms of site-specific impacts to the primary constituent elements
and the reasons for which the critical habitat unit was designated. Certain proposed actions, such as the selective
harvest or commercial thinning of timber stands, may or may not destroy or adversely modify critical habitat, depending
on the type and extent of harvest and the pre-project condition of the site in relation to Mexican spotted owl habitat
needs. Activities that disturb, remove, or retard the development of the primary constituent elements within designated
critical habitat units may adversely modify the Mexican spotted owl's critical habitat. These activities may include,
but are not limited to, actions that would significantly reduce the canopy closure of a timber stand, modify multi-canopy
stand structure, significantly reduce the stand's average tree diameter, significantly alter tree size and age
class distribution and species composition, reduce the availability of nesting structures and sites, reduce the
suitability of the landscape to provide for safe movement, or reduce the abundance or availability of prey species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to site-specific analysis, Service evaluation of proposed Federal actions would also consider the additive
effects of past, on-going, and proposed actions. Proposed projects within critical habitat would also be examined
spatially to determine adverse modification of habitat across the surrounding landscape. The additive effects
of actions in proximity to the proposed project may collectively result in the appreciable reduction of the value
of a critical habitat unit. Conversely, an isolated proposed action within a spacious expanse of unmodified habitat
may not adversely affect the function for which a critical habitat unit was designed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An activity cannot cause adverse modification of critical habitat in an area that does not contain or have the potential
to contain the physical and biological features comprising the primary constituent elements. Due to limitations
in the fineness of the mapping effort, and the interspersed nature of suitable and unsuitable habitat types, some
such areas have been incidentally included in the proposed designation as inclusions within surrounding Mexican
spotted owl habitat. Furthermore, some activities may not be restricted due to critical habitat designation because
there would be no effect on the primary constituent elements. However, Federal projects that do not adversely modify
critical habitat may still affect Mexican spotted owls (e.g., through disturbance) and, therefore, may be subject
to review under section 7 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some activities may be considered to be of benefit to Mexican spotted owl habitat and, therefore, would not be expected
to adversely modify critical habitat. Examples of activities that could benefit critical habitat may include some
protective measures such as fire suppression, prescribed burning, brush control, snag creation, and certain silvicultural
activities such as thinning.

Other Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9 of the Act prohibits intentional and non-intentional ``take'' of listed species and applies to all landowners
regardless of whether or not their lands are within critical habitat. The term ``take'', as defined by the Act, means
to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.
``Incidental take'' is take that results from, but is not the purpose of, an otherwise lawful activity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7 and section 10(a)(1)(B) authorize the Service to allow the incidental taking of listed species through
otherwise lawful activities such as timber harvesting. Biological opinions completed as part of formal section
7 consultation may authorize a set amount of incidental take associated with Federal activities. For non-Federal
actions, Section 10 incidental take permit applications must be supported by a habitat conservation plan that identifies
conservation measures that the permittee agrees to implement to conserve the species, usually on the permittee's
lands. A key element of the Service's review of a conservation plan is a determination of the plan's effect upon the
long-term conservation of the species. A conservation plan would be approved and a section 10(a) permit issued if
it would minimize and mitigate the impacts of the taking and would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival
and recovery of that species in the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service expects limited Federal involvement for projects on non-Federal lands and few formal section 7 consultations
on non-Federal lands that are included in proposed critical habitat. For those areas of non-Federal land within proposed
critical habitat, section 7 would apply only for actions that are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency.
The States and private individuals are still subject to the ``take'' prohibitions under section 9 of the Act, however,
and may enter into the section 10 conservation planning process where appropriate.

Economic Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific and
commercial information available and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of designating a particular
area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude areas from critical habitat upon a determination that the benefits
of such exclusions outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of critical habitat. The exclusion of such
areas from critical habitat may not occur when it is determined such exclusion may result in the extinction of the species
concerned. An economic analysis is currently being prepared. The Service intends to make the economic analysis available
for public review and comment, and notice of its availability will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

The Service intends that any final rule resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, governmental agencies, Indian nations, the scientific community,
industry, and any other interested parties concerning this proposed rule are hereby sought. Comments are particularly
sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The reasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of
the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Specific information on the amount and distribution of Mexican spotted owl habitat, and the number of owls and
distribution by landowner and land designation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Specific information on the ability or values of proposed areas to support other listed, proposed, or candidate
species and the relation of this proposal to maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem integrity; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Economic values associated with benefits of designating critical habitat for the Mexican spotted owl. Such benefits
include those derived from non-consumptive uses, e.g., hiking, camping, bird-watching; enhanced watershed protection;
improved air quality; increased soil retention; ``existence values'', and reductions in administrative costs;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The methodology the Service might use, under section 4(b)(2) of the Act, in determining if the benefits of excluding
an area from critical habitat outweigh the benefits of specifying the area as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received during the 60-day comment period on this proposed rule will be considered during preparation of
a final rulemaking. The final decision on the designation of critical habitat will take into consideration the comments
and any additional information received by the Service.

Required Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Based on the information
discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within proposed critical habitat areas,
it is not clear whether significant economic impacts will result from the critical habitat designation. There are
a limited number of actions on private lands that have Federal involvement through funds or permits that may be affected
by critical habitat designation. A final determination of the impacts of the proposal is not possible until the required
economic analysis is completed. The final rule will contain determinations of the effects of the proposed actions
in compliance with all relevant laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs,
information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this proposed designation.
Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

Primary constituent elements: Mexican spotted owl habitat that includes, but is not limited to, those habitat components
providing or with the potential to provide for nesting, roosting, foraging, or dispersal. Forested habitats used
for nesting and roosting are characterized as supporting mature stand attributes including high canopy closure,
multi-layered canopies, coniferous vegetation (sometimes including a hardwood understory), large diameter trees,
high densities of live trees, snags and large logs. Canyon habitats are steep-walled structures with rocky outcrops
and crevices; vegetation is generally sparse, but may be relatvely important in the canyon bottoms. Nesting and roosting
habitat also supports owl foraging activity; however, a wider array of habitat attributes may be found in areas used
solely for foraging, including fairly open and non-contiguous forest, small openings, woodland, and rocky slopes.

strategy for management of the lands under their jurisdiction in the Upper Columbia River Basin (UCRB) in Idaho, Montana,
Utah, Nevada, Wyoming, and a small part of Washington that is administered by Region 1 of the Forest Service. This strategy
will modify existing land use plans. The modification will include a coordinated ecosystem management strategy
for National Forest System and BLM public lands. This strategy will be consistent with the ``Framework for Ecosystem
Management in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' that is being completed by the Scientific Integration Team of the
Eastside Ecosystem Management Project. The EIS that will accompany this strategy will use the information from the
``Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' and information received
from the public as a basis for issue determination and for evaluating alternative strategies. Additional information
may be collected as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The strategy will be adopted in the form of decisions about desired ranges of future conditions for ecosystems, and
related standards and guidelines for management of National Forest System and BLM public lands on all or parts of the
UCRB. The EIS will consider alternative strategies for management of National Forest System and BLM-administered
lands and their effects in the entire UCRB. At a minimum: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The strategy will include direction which will protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems within the range of threatened
or endangered anadromous fish through amendments to Forest Plans and Resource Management Plans. This direction
will supersede any interim direction resulting from the Environmental Assessment for the Implementation of Interim
Strategies for Managing Anadromous Fish-producing Watersheds in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, and Portions
of California (commonly referred to as ``PACFISH''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The strategy also will include other necessary guidance applicable to the Basin as a whole, or to broad subregions
within the basin. This guidance will address forest ecosystem health; rangeland ecosystem health; aquatic and riparian
ecosystem health; integration of social and economic considerations; population viability; and the long-term
sustainability of threatened, endangered, and sensitive species. The guidance also will be developed by examining
other issues identified by the public through the scoping process. This guidance will be adopted as amendments to
the Forest Service Regional Guides for Regions 1 and 4 and/or amendments to Forest Service and BLM land use plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The third part of the strategy may identify changes to the ways current plans are implemented or budgets developed,
that can improve capability to achieve ecosystem management objectives. The strategy may also help establish priorities
for revising forest plans and developing or amending resource management plans. This part of the strategy does not
require environmental analysis, but may be addressed within the scope of this EIS.

 The purpose of this action is to develop and analyze a scientifically sound, ecosystem-based strategy for management
of lands administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service and the United States
Department of the Interior (USDI) Bureau of Land Management that are in the UCRB in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah,
and Nevada and that portion of Washington administered by the Forest Service's Northern Region. The strategy will
focus on ecosystem health, including its forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian, landscape, and social/economic
components, with emphasis on population viability and the sustainability of threatened, endangered, and sensitive
species.

The EIS team will prepare a proposed action that responds to problems described in the statement of purpose and need.
Formal scoping meetings will follow the development of the proposed action. The purpose and need statement and proposed
action will serve to focus formal scoping meetings by giving the public a better understanding of the agencies' early
thoughts about, or initial approximations of, what the UCRB ecosystem strategy might be. The theme of the proposed
action will be the restoration of ecological resiliency in forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian ecosystems
within the UCRB. (Aldo Leopold, in his essay The Land Ethic, defines the health of the land as ``the capacity of the land
for self-renewal.'' We speak of ecological resiliency as the capacity of an ecosystem, including its physical, biological
and human components, for self-renewal. We do not imply that all human wants will be satisfied by a resilient ecosystem.)
Alternatives to the proposed action will be developed largely in response to public comments on the proposed action
in formal scoping meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This EIS will address all BLM lands within the Columbia River Basin east of Oregon and Washington and all National Forest
System lands in the Columbia River Basin within the agency's Northern and Intermountain administrative Regions.
(This includes National Forest System and BLM public lands in all of Idaho except the southeast corner that drains
into the Great Basin. It also includes the portion of the Panhandle National Forest in Washington, that portion of
Montana west of the Continental Divide, a small portion of west-central Wyoming, the north-west corner of Utah, and
the northeastern corner of Nevada.) The selected alternative may result in amendment to the Forest Service Regional
Guides for the Northern and Intermountain Regions and amendment of the land use plans for the Forest Service and Bureau
of Land Management as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forest Service: Boise, Bridger-Teton, Caribou, Challis, Humboldt, Payette, Salmon, Sawtooth, and Targhee National
Forests in the Intermountain Region; and Panhandle, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Kootenai, Lolo, Flathead, Helena, Deerlodge,
and Bitterroot National Forests in the Northern Region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Land Management: Boise, Burley, Idaho Falls, Salmon, Shoshone, and Coeur d'Alene Districts in Idaho; Butte
District in Montana; Rock Springs District in Wyoming; Salt Lake District in Utah; and Elko and Winnemucca Districts
in Nevada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM Challis Resource Area (Salmon District), Bennett Hills Resource Area (Shoshone District), and Owyhee Resource
Area (Boise District) now are preparing Resource Management Plans (RMPs) that are expected to incorporate ecosystem
management strategies. Similarly, the Targhee National Forest is revising its forest plan, and the Clearwater National
Forest expects to revise its forest plan. The schedule for the Clearwater forest plan revision process will be announced
at the time a notice of intent for that purpose is published. These five planning efforts will continue. The Challis,
Bennett Hills, and Owyhee RMPs are expected to be completed in 1995. The Targhee forest plan revision is expected to
be complete in 1996, and the Clearwater forest plan revision is expected to be completed sometime after the completion
of the UCRB EIS. To the extent possible, those planning efforts will be coordinated with development of the UCRB ecosystem
management strategy. The UCRB EIS may lead to a Record of Decision that amends one or more of those five plans following
completion of on-going planning efforts. If the UCRB EIS is completed prior to completion of any of these five on-going
efforts, adjustments may be made to on-going efforts to ensure consistency with the UCRB ecosystem management strategy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLM lands subject to potential plan amendments through the UCRB effort total approximately 14 million acres in five
states. The National Forest System lands subject to potential plan amendment total approximately 31.5 million acres.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with this EIS, a basin-wide assessment known as the ``Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management
in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' is under development. (The ``interior Columbia River Basin'' has been defined
as the lands in the continental United States tributary to the Columbia River east of the crest of the Cascade Mountain
Range.) This Scientific Assessment will cover broad ecosystems, and describe social, economic, and biophysical
processes and functions. The natural resources within this broad geographic area have been altered over time by many
factors including drought, fire suppression, global climate change, livestock grazing, mining, timber harvest,
urbanization, and water uses. The results of the Scientific Assessment will be used, in part, to analyze the effects
of past management and present management under current land use plans as a baseline to help determine the need to change
management direction, and to determine the effects of different approaches to ecosystem management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will analyze a number of alternatives. One will be no action, defined as current land use plan direction without
modification of any decision resulting from the Environmental Assessment for the Implementation of Interim Strategies
for Managing Anadromous Fish-producing Watersheds in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, and Portions of California
(commonly referred to as the ``PACFISH'' strategy). Another will be current management direction as modified by
any decision issued as interim direction resulting from the ``PACFISH'' environmental assessment. As indicated,
further alternatives will be developed in response to issues identified during the public scoping process as defined
in the Council on Environmental Quality's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) implementing regulations to
identify a range of reasonable alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues that are expected to be addressed in detail through the development and analysis of alternatives (in addition
to the management of anadromous fish habitat) include ecosystem health and its forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian
components with emphasis on population viability and long-term sustainability of threatened, endangered, and
sensitive species. The use of public lands and resources in the production of goods and services within the context
of sustainability will also be examined. The evaluation of these alternatives and others will consider people's
expectations for public lands and resources, along with the capability of the ecosystems to provide and sustain these
values through time. Information will be used from the basin-wide Scientific Assessment, Tribal governments, state
and local governments, other federal agencies, and other appropriate sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The direction being developed through this process will serve as an ecosystem management strategy to move from current
conditions to more ecologically sustainable and socially desirable conditions, leaving options available for
future generations. The strategy will, at least, establish desired ranges of future conditions for broad forest,
rangeland, and aquatic/riparian habitat types and inter-related social, economic and landscape systems. Achievement
of desired ranges of future conditions by practices and activities developed and implemented at the national forest
and BLM district level, will result in restoration of ecosystem health and restoration of ecological processes that
maintain ecosystems over time. Ecosystem restoration to, and maintenance within, sustainable ranges by identifying
appropriate goals and objectives and management practices, can also help promote viability of associated social
and economic systems. The strategy will be based on integration of social values, ecological capabilities, and economic
relationships, and will recognize treaty rights reserved by various Native American Tribes on ceded lands and will
fulfill United States government trust responsibilities to the Tribes. The strategy will (1) assure habitat condition
needed to support species viability within the context of desired ecosystem function and structure; (2) address
the needs of species and habitats of concern (currently listed or being considered for listing under the Endangered
Species Act or designated as sensitive species by the Forest Service or BLM); (3) support the needs of dynamic ecosystems
that change over time and space; and (4) recognize the role that disturbance mechanisms play in the evolution and maintenance
of ecosystems.

The draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency in October, 1995, and will be available
for public review at that time. A public comment period of 90 days will be provided for the draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UCRB EIS Team (Team) believes it is important to give reviewers notice at this early stage of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EISs must structure
their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the
reviewer's position and contentions. [

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 90-day comment period on the draft EIS, so that substantive
comments and objections are made available to the Team at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in the final EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Team in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments on the draft
EIS should be as specific as possible. It also is helpful if comments refer to specific pages or chapters of the draft
statement. Comments also may address the adequacy of the draft EIS or the merits of the alternatives formulated and
discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that the final EIS will be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency approximately 6 months after
the draft EIS is published. The record of decision for National Forest System Lands will be issued with the final EIS
and will be subject to Forest Service appeal regulations (36 CFR 217). The BLM's proposed plan amendment decision
will be published with the final EIS and will be subject to BLM protest regulations (43 CFR 1610.5&hyph;2). The BLM's
record of decision will be published following resolution of any protests.

The Forest Service is seeking information and comments from Federal, State and local agencies as well as individuals
and organizations who may be interested in, or affected by, the proposed action. The Forest Service invites written
comments and suggestions on the issues related to the proposal and the area being analyzed. Information received
will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS and Final EIS. For most effective use, comments on potential issues should
be submitted to the Forest Service within 45 days from the date of publication of this Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Neutrally facilitated public meetings will be held in Grangeville, McCall, Boise, Pocatello, and Salmon, Idaho,
and Hamilton, Montana, on December 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, 1994, respectively, for the purpose of identifying issues,
developing Desired Future Conditions and mapping potential management zones. A response card will be mailed to the
persons and organizations on the ``Frankly Speaking'' mailing list. Similarly facilitated public meetings will
be held in Cascade, Idaho Falls, Lewiston, and Nampa, Idaho, and Missoula, Montana, to solicit comments on potential
indicators, standards and management prescriptions. Response cards will again be sent to the ``Frankly Speaking''
mailing list to solicit input on these topics. Agency-sponsored open house meetings will be held at the Forest Headquarters
offices of the Bitterroot, Boise, Caribou, Nez Perce, Payette and Salmon-Challis National Forests to gather comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. The date, time and location of all of the above meetings will be published
in ``The Idaho Statesman'' (Boise, Idaho), ``The Missoulian'' (Missoula, Montana), ``The Lewiston Tribune'' (Lewiston,
Idaho), ``The Star News (McCall, Idaho), ``The Post Register'' (Idaho Falls, Idaho) and ``The Recorder-Herald''
(Salmon, Idaho).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preparation of the EIS will include the following steps:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Define the purpose of and need for action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Identify potential issues, desired future conditions and management zones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Eliminate issues of minor importance or those that have been covered by previous and relevant environmental analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Select issues to be analyzed in depth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Identify prospective indicators, standards and management prescriptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Identify reasonable alternatives to the proposed action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Describe the affected environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Identify the potential environmental effects of the alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Select monitoring requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steps 2, 3, and 4 will be completed through the scoping process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steps 5 will consider a range of alternatives developed from the key issues. One of these will be the ``No Action'' alternative,
in which the existing management direction would be maintained. Other alternatives will consider various combinations
of indicators, standards, management zones and management prescriptions in response to issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 8 will describe the physical, biological and social attributes of the area to be affected by this proposal, with
special attention to the environmental factors that could be adversely affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Step 9 will analyze the environmental effects of each alternative. This analysis will provide the rationale for amending
the Land and Resource Management (Forest) Plans and will be consistent with National Forest Management Act requirements.
The direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of each alternative will be analyzed and documented. In addition, management
prescription or management zone specific mitigation measures will be identified and the effectiveness of these
mitigation measures will be disclosed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approximate boundary of the area used for this analysis is the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness which
includes almost the entire Middle Fork Salmon River drainage, the Main Salmon River drainage from Wheat Creek downstream
to the South Fork Salmon River, excluding Little Mallard and Robertson Creeks and that portion of the Main Salmon River
downstream from the South Fork Salmon River to Huntz Gulch on the South side of the river, the Big Creek drainage downstream
from Smith Creek, and the South Fork Salmon River downstream from Knob Creek. A total of 2,361,767 acres in four counties
(Custer, Idaho, Lemhi and Valley) is included in this Wilderness area. For a map, please refer to the ``Frank Church-River
of No Return Wilderness (North Half, South Half), available from the USDA, Forest Service, Intermountain Region,
Ogden Utah 84401.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed management activities would be administered by the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Headquarters
in Lemhi County, Idaho.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency representatives and other interested people are invited to visit with Forest Service officials at any time
during the EIS process. Three specific time periods are identified for the receipt of formal comments on the analysis.
The three comment periods are, (1) during the scoping process, (2) during the draft indicators and standards identification
and management prescriptions development phase, and (3) during the formal review period of the Draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS is estimated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in October 1995. At that time, the EPA will publish an availability notice of the Draft EIS in the Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the Federal Register. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at
that time. To be most helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy
of the statement of merits of the alternatives discussed (see The Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for
implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft environmental impact statements
must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts
an agency to the reviewers' positions and contentions.

are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns related to the proposed action, comments
on the Draft EIS should be as specific as possible. Referring to specific pages or chapters of the Draft EIS is most helpful.
Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft EIS or the merits of the alternative formulated and discussed in
the statement. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, 40 CFR 1503.3, in addressing these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS is expected to be released December 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lead Forest Supervisory for the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, who is the Responsible Official for
the EIS, will then make a decision regarding this proposal after considering the comments, responses, and environmental
consequences discussed in the Final Environmental Impact Statement, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies.
The reasons for the decision will be documented in a Record of Decision.

Announcing the Standard for Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS) are issued by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the Federal Property
and Administrative Services Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;235.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Name of Standard. Application Profile for the Government Information Locator Service (GILS) (FIPS PUB 192).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Category of Standard. Software Standard, Information Interchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Explanation. This standard describes an application profile for the Government Information Locator Service
(GILS). This application profile is based primarily on the American National Standard for Information Retrieval
Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Open Systems Interconnection (ANSI/NISO Z39.50&hyph;1992),
developed by the National Information Standards Organization (NISO). The Government Information Locator Service
(GILS) is a decentralized collection of servers and associated information services that will be used by the public
either directly or through intermediaries to find public information throughout the Federal government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This GILS Profile specifies the use of ANSI/NISO Z39.50&hyph;1992 in information service applications and provides
specifications for the overall GILS application, including the GILS Core and other aspects of the GILS server operating
in the Internet environment. This GILS profile will enable GILS client systems to interconnect and to interoperate
with any GILS server. This profile addresses intersystem interactions and information interchange for the GILS,
but does not specify user interface requirements, the internal structure of databases that contain GILS Locator
Records, or search engine functionality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GILS servers will support search and retrieval by accepting a search query and returning a result set or diagnostic
messages. GILS servers may also support browsing by accepting a well-known search query and returning a list of Locator
Records in brief display format.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the information resources pointed to by GILS Locator Records, as well as the GILS server itself, may be available
electronically through other communications protocols including the common Internet protocols that facilitate
electronic information transfer such as remote login (Telnet), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and electronic mail.
The use of SMTP and MIME protocols or other communications paths is outside the scope of the GILS Profile.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GILS Profile was developed by a group of industry and government experts in ANSI/NISO Z39.50&hyph;1992 implementations,
system implementations, and the organization of information. The specifications included in the GILS Profile reflect
the consensus of this group based on its work and input from a range of stakeholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Approving Authority. Secretary of Commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Maintenance Agency. U.S. Department of the Interior, United States Geological Survey (USGS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questions concerning this standard are to be addressed to the Maintenance Agency: GILS Program, United States Geological
Survey (USGS), 802 National Center, Reston, VA 22092. Users of this standard who need to be notified of changes that
occur prior to the next publication of the standard should complete the Change Request Form provided in this publication
and send it to: Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), Computer Systems Laboratory, National Institute of Standards
and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. The NIST will issue Change Notices on an as-needed basis.

11. Waivers. Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve
waivers to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority
only to a senior official designated pursuant to Section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only
when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Governmentwide savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
findings(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; Attn: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building,
Room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

.) directs NMFS to allow, on request, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals
by U.S. citizens who engage in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical
region, if certain findings are made, and regulations are issued. Under the MMPA, the term ``taking'' means to harass,
hunt, capture or kill or to attempt to harass, hunt, capture or kill marine mammals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permission may be granted for periods up to 5 years if the Secretary finds, after notification and opportunity for
public comment, that the taking will have a negligible impact on the species or stock(s) of marine mammals and will
not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species or stock(s) for subsistence uses. In addition,
NMFS must prescribe regulations that include permissible methods of taking and other means effecting the least practicable
adverse impact on the species and its habitat, and on the availability of the species for subsistence uses, paying
particular attention to rookeries, mating grounds and areas of similar significance. The regulations must include
requirements pertaining to the monitoring and reporting of such taking. Regulations governing the taking of ringed
seals incidental to on-ice seismic activities were promulgated on January 13, 1993 (58 FR 4091) and remain in effect
until December 31, 1997.

(November 4, 1994); and (3) Schlumberger, 500 W. International Airport Road, Anchorage, AK 99518 (October 31, 1994).
All letters request a take by harassment of a small number of ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic work in the Beaufort
Sea, AK.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issuances of these letters are based on findings that the total takings will have a negligible impact on the ringed
seal species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of this species for subsistence
uses.

Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the
Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on
December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding dated September 26, 1994 between the Governments of
the United States and El Salvador; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972,
as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on January 1, 1995, entry into the United States for consumption
and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton and man-made fiber textile products in Categories 340/640,
produced or manufactured in El Salvador and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1995
and extending through December 31, 1995, in excess of 874,500 dozen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Imports charged to this category limit for the period October 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 shall be charged against
that level of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balance. In the event the limit established for that period has
been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the level set forth in this directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limit set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future pursuant to the provisions of the MOU dated September
26, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and El Salvador.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for
consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that this action falls within the foreign

Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company; Proposed Recovery
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
December 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on November 29 1994, Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Company (Alabama-Tennessee), filed to recover
the net debit balance due and payable by Shippers on its system under Section 33.4 of the General Terms and Conditions
of the Alabama-Tennessee's FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1. According to Alabama-Tennessee, the amount
due results from a true-up performed by Alabama-Tennessee following the elimination of its Transportation Cost
Rate Adjustment (TCRA). Alabama-Tennessee states that its filing reconciles the remaining costs associated with
stranded upstream capacity still owed to Alabama-Tennessee, notwithstanding the elimination of its TCRA pursuant
to the Commission's November 9, 1994 order in Docket No. RP93&hyph;198, and certain refunds recently made by Tennessee
Gas Pipeline Company to be flowed through by Alabama-Tennessee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alabama-Tennessee proposes that it be permitted to recover this true-up adjustment through a one-time direct bill
to affected customers which it will show on regular invoices that it will tender for January, 1995 service when its
former resale customers' demand historically increases. Alabama-Tennessee states that by utilizing this approach,
any adverse effects that these customers might otherwise experience during the time these costs are being recovered
will be mitigated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alabama-Tennessee has requested that the Commission grant such waivers as may be necessary to accept and approve
the filing as submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capital Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

On November 25, 1992, Montana Power Company, licensee for the Missouri-Madison Project No. 2188, filed an application
for a new or subsequent license pursuant to the Federal Power Act (FPA) and the Commission's regulations thereunder.
Project No. 2188 is located on the Missouri and Madison Rivers in Cascade, Lewis and Clark, Madison, and Gallatin Counties,
Montana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The license for Project No. 2188 was issued for a period ending November 30, 1994. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C.
808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at the expiration of a license term, to issue from year to year an annual license
to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the prior license until a new license is issued, or the project
is otherwise disposed of as provided in Section 15 or any other applicable section of the FPA. If the project's prior
license waived the applicability of Section 15 of the FPA, then, based on Section 9(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act, 5 U.S.C. 558(c), and as set forth at 18 CFR 16.21(a), if the licensee of such project has filed an application for
a subsequent license, the licensee may continue to operate the project in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the license after the minor or minor part license expires, until the Commission acts on its application. If the licensee
of such a project has not filed an application for a subsequent license, then it may be required, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.21(b),
to continue project operations until the Commission issues someone else a license for the project or otherwise orders
disposition of the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is subject to Section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that an annual license for Project No. 2188
is issued to Montana Power Company for a period effective December 1, 1994, through November 30, 1995, or until the
issuance of a new license for the project or other disposition under the FPA, whichever comes first. If issuance of
a new license (or other disposition) does not take place on or before November 30, 1995, notice is hereby given that,
pursuant to 18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license under Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed automatically without
further order or notice by the Commission, unless the Commission orders otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the project is not subject to Section 15 of the FPA, notice is hereby given that Montana Power Company is authorized
to continue operation of the Missouri-Madison Project No. 2188 until such time as the Commission acts on its application
for subsequent license.

Tennessee states that the revisions made by Tennessee comply with the Order in Docket No. RP91&hyph;203, November
9, 1994 (69 FERC &para; 61,212) accepting tariff sheets implementing Tennessee's cost of service settlement and
with the order of November 18 in Docket Nos. RP94&hyph;309 et al. (69 FERC &para; 61,234). In particular, Tennessee
has clarified, through the tariff sheet listed in Item A, which surcharges apply to the PTR Rate Schedule and clearly
stated the rate after current adjustment will be increased to reflect the applicable surcharges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Item B, Tennessee has reflected the removal of GSR costs from its IT rates for the period of September 1993 through
April 1994 and a reduction to the GSR components effective May 1 and August 1 (respectively). Tennessee is, however,
reserving its right to seek rehearing of the Commission's order but has adjusted the rates as specified by the Commission,
as demonstrated in Schedules 1&hyph;1.3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Item C, Tennessee modified the effective date of the settlement fuel rates for Rate Schedule NET shippers to November
1, 1992. This change does not apply to the Segment U rates which are subject to separate determination in Docket No.
RP92&hyph;132. Finally, in Item D, Tennessee has reflected the appropriate settlement rate for OSP under the T&hyph;180
Rate Schedule for the period November 1992 through September 1993 and from September 1993 to current.

in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

Take notice that on November 23, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 94, Substitute Original Sheet
Nos. 95A and 95B, Substitute First Revised Sheet Nos. 96 and 100, with a proposed effective date of November 1, 1994.
Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the Commission's letter order dated November 15,
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that the Commission approved Tennessee's previous filing subject to a few modifications. The instant
filing implements those modifications. Specifically, Tennessee has clearly stated at Sheet No. 95B that any authorized
overrun transportation will be subject to the scheduling priorities of Section 5(e) of Article III of its General
Terms and Conditions, which clearly states that authorized overrun has a priority below firm transportation. Tennessee
has also modified the language of &sect;3.4(b) to clarify that Tennessee will waive both the overrun charge and the
$25.00 penalty when overruns are authorized. Tennessee has also added the language that had been omitted from Section
8.1 of the FS Rate Schedule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee also states that has made a few other changes in the instant filing to either clarify items or respond to customer
requests. Specifically, Tennessee has replaced the term ``excess deliverability'' with ``conditional deliverability''
wherever it appears in the FS Rate Schedule and replaced the term ``customer'' with ``Shipper'' wherever it appeared.
Tennessee has clarified that Section 3.4(e) applies to assignments as well as agency arrangements. Finally, Tennessee
has clarified that the requirement that a Shipper's Maximum Storage Quantity be between 30 and 150 times a shipper's
Maximum Daily Withdrawal Quantity applies exclusive of any conditional deliverability awarded in this docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Tennessee does not believe any waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission
grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state
regulatory commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest with reference to said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Section 211 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests
will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to this proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection.

of GSR costs allocated to its IT rates based on the original amortization period reflected in Docket Nos. RP93&hyph;151
and RP94&hyph;39. Tennessee states that it is filing concurrently in Docket Nos. RP91&hyph;203 and RP94&hyph;309
tariff sheets reflecting the same adjustment for periods prior to November 1, 1994.

Take notice that on November 29, 1994, Wyoming Interstate Company, Ltd. (WIC) filed a Motion To Place Rates Into Effect
accompanied by revised tariff sheets incorporating the new rates as revised to reflect a December 1, 1994 effective
date and a revised Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) rate previously effective October 1, 1994. WIC states that on June
29, 1994, the Commission accepted WIC's rate filing, and suspended its effectiveness until December 1, 1994 (67 FERC
&para; 61,390). WIC's motion places those higher rates into effect on December 1, 1994, subject to refund and other
conditions, and its revised tariff sheets include those which were suspended and with respect to which no compliance
changes were required by the Commission's June 29, 1994 order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WIC states that copies of this filing have been served on WIC's jurisdictional customers and public bodies, and the
filing is available for public inspection at WIC's offices in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North
Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR Section 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests will
be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection
in the Public Reference Room.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on November 23, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), tendered for filing as part of
its FERC Gas Tariff, Fifth Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute Second Revised Sheet Nos. 126, 128, 129, Substitute Original
Sheet No. 659D and Third Revised Sheet No. 125. Tennessee states that the purpose of this filing is to comply with the
Commission's October 27, 1994 order in the above-referenced docket approving Tennessee's proposed PAT Rate Schedule.
Tennessee requests an effective date for the above-referenced sheets of November 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that in its October 27 Order, the Commission conditioned its acceptance on Tennessee responding
to concerns that the Commission had with the filing. In response, the instant filing, eliminates the reference to
``Shipper's facilities'' in &sect;3.2 of the PAT Rate Schedule at Sheet No. 125. Second, Tennessee has clarified
at Sheet No. 125 that scheduling under Rate Schedule PAT is subject to the same scheduling provisions as all other rate
schedules. Third, Tennessee made the changes requested by the New England Customer Group at Sheet No. 659D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above-described changes, Tennessee states that it has modified the nominations procedures to
allow shippers to nominate PAT Service on a monthly basis during the Winter Season instead of requiring them to nominate
on a seasonal basis. Tennessee has agreed to make this change at the request of shippers because monthly nominations
will provide shippers with additional flexibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee also states that, in response to concerns that certain restrictions on PAT service might not be necessary
or might be discriminatory, restricting PAT service to storage points is necessary at this time in order to avoid problems
with Tennessee's nomination and allocation system. Tennessee is willing to reevaluate the need for this restriction,
but does not feel that it can ensure smooth operations for this winter without it. Similarly, Tennessee states that
because all of Tennessee's storage interconnection points are covered by balancing agreements, the balancing agreement
requirement will not prevent anyone from using this service this winter. If, after one winter season of operations,
Tennessee removes the storage restriction, it will also reevaluate the need for the balancing agreement requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Tennessee does not believe any waivers are necessary, Tennessee respectfully requests that the Commission
grant any waivers it deems necessary for acceptance of this filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee states that copies of the filing have been mailed to all of its jurisdictional customers and affected state
regulatory commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest with reference to said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 211 of the Commission's
Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211. All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994. Protests
will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to this proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file and available for public inspection.

~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of castor oil, and information
on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered
the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential
exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use
of castor oil when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Industrial Bank of Japan, Limited, Tokyo, Japan (Applicant), has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the Bank
Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) (BHC Act) and  225.23(a)(3) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(3))
to purchase Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., Inc., New York, New York (Company), from Applicant's subsidiary bank, IBJ
Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Company, New York, New York, and thereby engage in the following activities: 1) executing
and clearing, clearing without executing, executing without clearing, purchasing and selling through the use of
omnibus trading accounts, and providing investment advisory services to institutional customers with respect
to previously approved futures and options on futures contracts on financial commodities; 2) providing investment
advice pursuant to 12 CFR 225.25(b)(4); 3) underwriting and dealing in securities as permitted by 12 CFR 225.25(b)(16);
4) trading foreign exchange in the spot market for nonhedging purposes; 5) trading over the counter options on U.S.
Treasury securities for nonhedging purposes; 6) trading options, futures, options on futures and forward contracts
in accordance with 225.142 to hedge foreign exchange and securities positions; and 7) acting as an agent for affiliates
in the purchase and sale of over the counter interest rate contracts, including swaps, forwards, options (including
caps, collars and floors), and any other instrument that gives rise to similar credit risks, and providing the above-listed
futures commission merchant services to affiliates. The activities will be conducted on a worldwide basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity
which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely
related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires
that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine
that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case
that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public
benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant states that the Board previously has determined by order or regulation that all of the proposed activities
are closely related to banking.

In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company

or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). Applicant
believes that the proposal would produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular,
Applicant maintains that the proposal would produce operational and management efficiencies for Applicant's United
States operations. In addition, Applicant states that the proposed activities would not result in adverse effects
such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound
banking practices.

National Toxicology Program; Availability of the Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HHS' National Toxicology Program (NTP) today announces the availability of the Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Annual Report on Carcinogens, prepared by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), U.S. Public Health Service,
is issued by the Secretary of the Department of Health Service, (DHHS) pursuant to an amendment to the Public Health
Service Act (section 262, Pub. L. 95&hyph;622) which requires the Secretary to publish an annual report that contains
``a list of all substances (i) which either are known to be carcinogens and (ii) to which a significant number of persons
residing in the United States are exposed *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The law also states that the reports should provide
available information on the nature of exposures, the estimated numbers of persons exposed, and the extent to which
the implementation of Federal regulations decreases the risk to public health from exposure to these chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of the Report, ``known'' carcinogens are defined as those substances for which the evidence from human
studies indicates that there is causal relationship between exposure to the substance and human cancer. Substances
``which may reasonably be anticipated to be carcinogens'' are defined as those for which there is limited evidence
of carcinogenicity in humans or sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Substances in the above categories, for which potential exposure of persons residing in the United States has been
demonstrated, are included in the Report. The Seventh Annual Report does not contain all known carcinogens or substances
reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens. Additional substances with identified carcinogenic properties as defined
above will be included in subsequent Annual Reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New entries in the Seventh Annual Report were chosen from those designated by the agencies participating in the preparation
of the Report, from those tested within the National Toxicology Program and the National Cancer Institute Carcinogenesis
Bioassay Program; or from those evaluated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a component
of the World Health Organization (WHO), located in Lyon, France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Seventh Annual Report on Carcinogens Summary does not contain specific information on regulations promulgated
by regulatory health agencies. In most other respects, the information is the same as that in the full report. Copies
will be sent automatically to those on the mailing list; others may request a single copy without charge by writing
the NTP Central Data Management, MD A0&hyph;02, P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the complete Report are available from the National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road,
Springfield, VA 22161. Tel: 800&hyph;553&hyph;6847. There is a $105.00 charge for the document plus a $8.00 per order
shipping and handling charge. Ask for Report No. PB 95&hyph;109781 when ordering.

<DOCTITLE>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences: Validation and Acceptance of Alternative Testing Methods:
Request for Comments</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1301 of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law No. 103&hyph;43) directed
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to establish an Applied Toxicological Research
and Testing Program to conduct applied research and testing regarding toxicology. The Act specified that the toxicology-related
activities to be carried out by the program would include: (i) Establishing criteria for the validation and regulatory
acceptance of alternative testing methods; and (ii) recommending a process through which scientifically validated
alternative methods can be accepted for regulatory use. The purpose of this announcement is to invite interested
parties to provide information for consideration in the formulation of these criteria and processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the directives in Public Law No. 103&hyph;43, the NIEHS has established the ad hoc Interagency Coordinating
Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM) to develop recommendations relating to the validation
and acceptance of new and revised testing methods that would be useful to Federal agencies. Many new and revised test
methods represent alternative methods, models, and approaches in that they: (a) Result in the reduction of the total
number of animals required in a test; (b) incorporate refinements of procedures to lessen or eliminate pain or distress
to animals; or (c) provide for the partial or total replacement of animals with non-animal systems, or the replacement
of one animal species with another (e.g., a mammalian species replaced by a nonmammalian or invertebrate species).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee's goals include recommending criteria and processes that will: (1) Encourage the development of new
methods and improvement of existing test methods to generate data useful for risk assessment; (2) lead to the scientific
validation of new and improved test methods; (3) increase the likelihood of regulatory acceptance of scientifically
valid new test methods; and (4) encourage the refinement and reduction of animal use in testing, and the replacement
of animals with non-animal methods and/or phylogenetically lower species, when scientifically feasible.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a schedule III notice. Wildlife subject to this notice is subject to detention, refusal of clearance or seizure,
and forfeiture if imported into the United States. Violators may also be subject to criminal or civil prosecution.
On April 21, 1994, the CITES Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties No. 800 urging the Parties to suspend imports
of certain animal species from the following twelve countries: Argentina, Azerbaijan, China, India, Indonesia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Peru, Republic of Moldova, Togo, Ukraine, and the United Republic of Tanzania. This notification
was based on a decision made by the CITES Standing Committee during meeting held in March, 1994, which asked CITES Party
countries to suspend imports in certain animal species from the affected countries. This action was required by CITES
Resolution Conference 8.9, adopted at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, in 1992,
which established a procedure for developing remedial actions and implementing them through import suspensions,
if voluntary compliance by exporting countries is not satisfactory.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Article IV, paragraph 2(a) of the CITES treaty allows commercial and noncommercial trade in species listed in CITES
Appendix II, but export permits for such trade may be issued only if a designated Management Authority of the country
has determined that the specimens were legally acquired, and if a designated Scientific Authority of that country
has advised the Management Authority that the export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Article
IV, paragraph 3 goes on to require that exports of Appendix II species be limited in any way necessary to ensure that
the population level of a species is consistent with that species' role in its ecosystem and that the population level
of that species be maintained well above the level where it might qualify for inclusion in Appendix I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past decade, CITES parties have become increasingly concerned that certain Appendix II species are subject
to particularly high volumes of trade without sufficient biological data for Scientific Authorities to make the
necessary judgments that exports are not detrimental to the species, as required by Article IV. In 1983, CITES parties
adopted a resolution at the Fourth Conference of the Parties in Gaborone, Botswana, acknowledging that many parties
are not effectively implementing Article IV and thus risk losing the benefits of continued availability of these
resources. This resolution, Conf. 4.7, established a project to identify Appendix II species involved in significant
levels of international trade, and to develop and negotiate with exporting and importing countries whatever measures
were necessary to bring trade down to levels consistent with Article IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, at the Sixth Conference of the Parties in Ottawa, Canada, parties charged the newly established CITES Animals
Committee with the task of establishing a list of Appendix II species being significantly affected by trade, reviewing
all available information, and formulating remedial measures for these species. The CITES Secretariat coordinated
or contracted for studies to develop lists of mammal, bird, and reptile species and collect relevant information
about these species, in cooperation with the IUCN World Conservation Union. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service)
cooperated with and provided financial support for a number of these studies.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the Eighth Conference of the Parties in 1992, in Kyoto, Japan, CITES parties adopted a resolution developed by the
CITES Animals Committee which recognized that substantial trade in wild-caught animals was still going on contrary
to the provisions of Article IV, and that necessary remedial measures were not being properly implemented. This resolution,
Conf. 8.9, established a formal process for the Animals Committee to develop remedial measures, including ``zero
quotas'' (that is, temporary trade bans) when appropriate; for the Secretariat to communicate these recommendations
to the exporting countries; and, where exporting countries do not satisfactorily implement the measures, for the
CITES Standing Committee to call on parties to suspend imports of these species from the offending countries until
they are in compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During meetings of the Animals Committee in 1992 and 1993, attended by representatives of the Service, remedial measures
were developed and subsequently communicated to exporting countries by the Secretariat. The Standing Committee
reviewed reports from the Secretariat of compliance and noncompliance with these remedial measures during three
meetings in 1993 and 1994. The Service represented the United States in these meetings, with the Department of State.
During the last of these meetings, held in Geneva, Switzerland, in March, 1994, the Standing Committee directed the
Secretariat to issue a formal notice calling for a suspension of trade in particular Appendix II species from twelve
CITES parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on April 21, 1994, the Secretariat issued Notification to the Parties number 800, calling for a suspension
of imports of these species from the affected countries. Implementation of these restrictions is necessary to stop
trade considered to be detrimental to the survival of the species and thus in contravention of the requirements of
CITES Article IV. CITES parties failing to implement these trade suspensions would be contributing to the decline
of the affected species, and would be subject to formal citation in the CITES Infractions Report and possible censure
by the CITES Conference of the Parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;1544), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is granted
the authority to detain, refuse clearance of, or seize any fish or wildlife or plants that are imported into the United
States in violation of CITES. Regulations contained in 50 CFR 14.53(c) indicate that refusal of clearance of imported
wildlife is warranted if there are reasonable grounds to believe that documentation for the clearance of such wildlife
is not valid. Similarly, regulations contained in 50 CFR 23.12(a)(2) require that all imports of Appendix II wildlife
into the United States be accompanied by a valid foreign export permit or re-export certificate, unless an exemption
applies. The Service agrees with notification to the Parties number 800 and believes that any permits issued for the
indicated species by the affected countries are not valid because required findings of ``non-detriment'' and/or
lawful acquisition have not been credibly demonstrated by the exporting countries in light of the significant trade
level in particular Appendix II species.

Background._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These investigations are being instituted as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations by the Department
of Commerce that imports of unwrought pure magnesium from China, Russia, and Ukraine and imports of unwrought alloy
magnesium from China and Russia are being sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section
733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The investigations were requested in a petition filed on March 31, 1994, by Magnesium
Corporation of America (Magcorp), Salt Lake City, UT; the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 564,
Freeport, TX; and the United Steelworkers of America, Local 8319, Salt Lake City, UT.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 221 of the Trade Act of 1974, an investigation was initiated on August 8, 1994, in response to a petition
which was filed by the United Auto Workers, Local 848, on behalf of workers at Vought Aircraft Company, Dallas, TX.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An active certification, revised November 16, 1994, covering the petitioning group of workers remains in effect
(TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,206). Consequently, further investigation in this case would serve no purpose, and the investigation
has been terminated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1996 of the Machinists Union (IAM), requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade
adjustment assistance (TAA). The denial notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 15, 1994 (59 FR 41792).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation files show that the workers produce school and office furniture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The union submitted annual U.S. import data from the Department of Commerce for furniture which would include the
products produced by Smith System. This impact data, however, was included in the Department's investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial is based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements
of the Trade Act was not met. worker separations were the result of a corporate decision to consolidate its production
of furniture at other domestic locations. During the consolidation period, employment at the Princeton plant decreased
while employment at the corporate transfer plants increased commensurately. There was no decline in corporate sales
during this period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA Benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by foreign competition
but only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like
or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to declines in sales or production and employment
at the workers' firm.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<DOCTITLE>James River Corporation Old Town, Maine; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On reconsideration, the James River Corporation submitted new information showing that hardwood pulp sales by the
company declined in 1993 compared to 1992. The initial findings show substantial worker separations in 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. imports of hardwood pulp increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer increased its imports of hardwood pulp
while decreasing its purchases from the subject firm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the James River Corporation
workers in old Town, Maine were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive
with hardwood pulp producer at James River Corporation in Old Town, Maine.

<DOCTITLE>Saft Aerospace Batteries, A Division of Saft America Gainesville, Florida; Formerly Gates Aerospace Batteries
Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc.; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Worker Adjustment
Assistance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification
of Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance applicable to all workers of the subject firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The certification notice was issued on September 2, 1994 and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 1, 1994 (59 FR 54631&hyph;2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the request of the company, the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. The investigation
findings show that the Gates Aerospace Batteries Division of Gates Energy Products, Inc., was the predecessor-in-interest
firm. Many of the workers had unemployment insurance (UI) taxes paid under the former firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to properly reflect this matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,951 is hereby issued as follows:

<DOCTITLE>F.C.I.; Freeman, South Dakota Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 9, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for NAFTA Transitional adjustment Assistance for former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 23, 1994 (59 FR 48914).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On reconsideration, it was found that F.C.I. ceased production of industrial back supports in January, 1994. Other
findings show substantial worker separations occurred in 1993 and 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer of industrial back supports from F.C.I. decreased
its purchases in 1994 and substantially increased its import purchases of back supports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the F.C.I. workers
in Freeman, South Dakota were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with
the back supports produced at F.C.I. in Freeman, South Dakota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the F.C.I. workers in
Freeman, South Dakota.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``All workers of F.C.I. in Freeman, South Dakota who were engaged in employment related to the production of back supports
who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after June 7, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Section 250 of the Trade Act of 1974.''

<DOCTITLE>Abnormal Occurrence Report Section 208 Report Submitted to the Congress</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the requirements of Section 208 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as
amended, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has published and issued another periodic report to Congress on
abnormal occurrences (NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 17, No. 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, which created NRC, an abnormal occurrence is defined as ``an unscheduled
incident or event that the Commission (NRC) determines is significant from the standpoint of public health or safety.''
NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection
against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report to Congress is for the second calendar quarter of 1994. The report identifies the occurrences or events
that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also
described.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report addresses seven abnormal occurrences (AOs) at NRC-licensed facilities. Five involved medical brachytherapy
misadministrations, one involved a medical teletherapy misadministration, and one involved a medical sodium iodide
misadministration. Four AOs were reported by the Agreement States as of August 3, 1994. Two involved medical brachytherapy
misadministrations, one involved a radiation burn received by an industrial radiographer, and one involved a lost
well logging source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report also contains updates of seven AOs previously reported by NRC licensees and five AOs previously reported
by Agreement State licensees. Three ``Other Events of Interest'' are also reported. One involved a deliberate coverup
of an error in a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical administration at an NRC licensee, one involved an Order Suspending
License and Demand for Information at an NRC licensee, and one involved an overexposure of an industrial radiographer
at an Agreement State licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.
(Lower Level), Washington, D.C. 20037, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout
the country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from November 14, 1994, through
November 25, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on November 23, 1994 (59 FR 60377).

Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By January 6, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Hydraulic - Water level in the Discharge Canal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The deletion of the discharge canal specification of 4.5 [plus or minus] 1 ft mean sea level
(msl) with daily monitoring still leaves the operating restrictions delineated in Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report (UFSAR) Section 2.4.8.3.3 (4.5 [plus or minus] 2 ft msl) and the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit requirements to minimize the impact of the discharge canal on the local groundwater supply.
As stated in this UFSAR section, the effect on the local ground water regime will be minimal within this band. Level
recorders in the control room facilitate the continued monitoring the discharge canal level in excess of the Appendix
B Environment Technical Specification (ETS) listed daily surveillance. This change in no way affects the design
or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The discharge canal level is an environmental concern with the effects of a spill of radioactive
liquids (UFSAR Section 2.4.12.3) being a path to the intake canal, due to the areas natural gradient. With the estimated
travel time for the liquid to reach the canal (intake) at 60 years, and the large flow rate the degree of dilution is such
that this does not pose a threat to local wells. The amendment would not affect the operation or design of any plant equipment;
therefore, no new credible accidents are created. In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability
of the response systems to mitigate the consequences of any accident previously evaluated; therefore, no new or different
accident would result from this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The existence of these ETS
does not provide a margin of safety related to the nuclear operation of the site. No safety limits are affected by this
change. Therefore, this amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meteorology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The deletion of the meteorology specification still leaves the program delineated in UFSAR
Section 2.3.3, Onsite Meteorological Measurements Program, and reporting/recording of the hourly meteorological
data required to support Technical Specification 6.9.1.10.a, Semiannual Radioactive Effluent Release Report.
This program is based on the meteorological monitoring program described in Regulatory Guide 1.23, and NUREG-0654.
While the existing ETS 30 day reporting requirement for extended out-of-service time and shiftly manual acquisition
of data during batch or accidental releases are not otherwise covered, the program does contain the Regulatory Guide
1.23 reference to 90% data recovery and a backup phone line is available for data retrieval. This proposed amendment
in no way affects the design or operation of equipment that could initiate or mitigate any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The meteorological monitoring program is specified in UFSAR Section 2.3.3. The amendment
would not affect the operation or design of any plant equipment; therefore, no new credible accidents are created.
In addition, the proposed amendment would not affect the capability of the response systems to mitigate the consequences
of any accident previously evaluated nor would the amendment reduce the effectiveness of the Emergency Response
Plan; therefore, no new or different accident would result from this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The meteorological ETS does
not provide any additional margin of safety related to the operation of a nuclear plant. The meteorological program
established in the UFSAR covers the requirements stated in Appendix E to 10 CFR 50 by providing meteorological systems
adequate for determining the magnitude of, and for continuously assessing the impact of, the release of radioactive
materials to the environment. The meteorological instrumentation is used to measure environmental parameters
which may affect distribution of fission products and gases following a Design Basis Accident (DBA); however, it
is not a primary success path for the mitigation of a DBA. No safety limits are affected by this change. Therefore, this
amendment would not result in a reduction in any margin of safety.

The proposed changes would revise the Technical Specifications to increase the surveillance test intervals and
allowable out-of-service times for selected instrumentation addressed in Section 3/4.3. The proposed changes
would permit specified channel functional tests to be conducted quarterly rather than weekly or monthly. Specifically,
the proposed changes would revise the surveillance test intervals and allowable out-of-service times for the reactor
protection system instrumentation, isolation actuation instrumentation, emergency core cooling system actuation
instrumentation, control rod withdrawal block instumentation, control room emergency ventilation system instrumentation,
anticipated transient without scram - recirculation pump trip system instrumentation, end-of-cycle recirculation
pump trip system instrumentation, and reactor core isolation cooling system actuation instrumentation, in accordance
with NRC-approved General Electric Company Licensing Topical Reports and NUREG-1433, Standard Technical Specifications,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

1) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generic Licensing Topical Report, NEDC-30851P-A, assessed the impact of changing RPS surveillance test intervals
(STIs) and allowable out-of-service times (AOTs) on the RPS failure frequency, the scram frequency and equipment
cycling. Specifically, Section 5.7.4, ``Significant Hazards Assessment'' of NEDC-30851P-1 states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Fewer challenges to the safeguards system, due to less frequent testing of the RPS, conservatively results in a
decrease of approximately one percent in core damage frequency''. This decrease is based upon the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* Based on the plant-specific experience presented in Appendix J, the estimated reduction in scram frequency (0.3
scrams/yr) represents a 1 to 2 percent decrease in core damage frequency based on the BWR plant specific Probabilistic
Risk Assessments (PRAs) listed in Table 5-8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* The increase in core damage frequency due to less frequent testing is less than one percent. This increase is even
lower (less than 0.01 percent) when the changes resulting from the implementation of the Anticipated Transients
Without Scram (ATWS) rule are considered. Therefore, this increase is more than offset by the decrease in CDF due to
fewer scrams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* The effect of reducing unnecessary cycles on RPS equipment, although not easily quantifiable also results in a decrease
in core damage frequency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
* The overall impact on core damage frequency of the changes in allowable out-of-service time is negligible.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&amp;L concurs that the proposed changes do not
significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase
in probability of a a scram failure due to RPS unavailablity is insignificant. The overall probability of an accident
is decreased as the time the RPS instrumentation logic operates undisturbed is increased, resulting in fewer inadvertent
scrams during testing and repair. The proprietary plant-specific analysis contained in this submittal (Enclosure
6) demonstrates that, although BSEP Units 1 and 2 differ from the generic plant analyzed in LTR NEDC-30851P-A, the
net effect of the plant-specific differences does not alter the generic conclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generic Licensing Topical Reports, NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 2 and NEDC 31677P-A, assessed the impact of changing
STIs and AOTs for BWR Isolation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Summary of Results,'' of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement
2 states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The results indicate that the effects on probability of failure to initiate isolation are very small and the effects
on probability or frequency of failure to isolate are negligible in nearly every case. In addition, the results indicate
that increasing the AOT to 24 hours for tests and repairs has a negligible effect on the probability of failure of the
isolation function. These combined with changes to the testing intervals and allowable out-of service times for
RPS and ECCS instrumentation provide a net improvement to plant safety and operations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Section 5.6, ``Assessment of Net Effect of Changes,'' of NEDC-31677P-A states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``A reduction in core damage frequency (CDF) of at least as much as estimated in the ECCS instrumentation analysis
can be expected when the isolation actuation instrumentation STIs are changed from one month to three months. The
chief contributor to this reduction is the channel functional tests for the MSIVs. Inadvertent closure of the MSIVs
will cause an unnecessary plant scram. This reduction in CDF more than compensates for any small incremental increase
(10% or 1.0E-07/year) in calculated isolation function failure frequency when the STI is extended to three months.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&amp;L concurs that the proposed changes do not
significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase in probability
of an isolation failure due to isolation instrumentation unavailability is insignificant. For those parameters
common to RPS, the overall probability of an accident is actually decreased as the time the RPS instrumentation logic
operates undisturbed is increased, resulting in less inadvertent scrams during testing and repair. The plant-specific
evaluation provided with this submittal (Enclosure 8) demonstrates that the conclusions of the generic analyses
are applicable to BSEP Units 1 and 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The generic Licensing Topical Report, NEDC-30936P-A (Parts 1 and 2), assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs
for all BWR ECCS Actuation Instrumentation. Section 4.0, ``Technical Assessment of Changes,'' of NEDC-30936P-A
(Part 2) states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The results indicate an insignificant (less than 5E-7 per year) increase in water injection function failure frequency
when STIs are increased from 31 days to 92 days, AOTs for repair of the ECCS actuation instrumentation are increased
from one hour to 24 hours, and AOTs for surveillance testing are increased from two to six hours. For all four BWR models
the increase represents less than 4% increase in failure frequency. However, when other factors which influence
the overall plant safety are considered, the net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From this generic analysis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&amp;L concurs that the proposed changes do not
significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, since the increase
in probability of a water injection failure due to ECCS instrumentation unavailability is insignificant and the
net result is judged to be an improvement in plant safety. The plant-specific analysis contained in this submittal
(Enclosure 7) demonstrates that, although BSEP Units 1 and 2 differ from the generic model analyzed in LTR NEDC-30936P-A,
the net effect of the plant-specific differences does not alter the generic conclusions. The generic Licensing Topical
Reports, NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1, and GENE-770-06-1-A assessed the impact of changing Control Rod Block STIs
and AOTs on Rod Block failure frequency. GENE-770-06-1-A also assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on ATWS-RPT
and EOC-RPT failure frequency. Section 5 (Brookhaven National Laboratory's Technical Evaluation Report - Attachment
2 to the NRC SER) of NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1 states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1``The BWR Owners' Group proposed changes to the Technical Specifications concerning the test requirements for
BWR control rod block instrumentation. The changes consist of increasing the surveillance test intervals from one
to three months. These test interval extensions are consistent with the already approved changes to STIs for the Reactor
Protection System. The technical analysis reviewed and verified as documented herein indicates that there will
be no significant changes in the availability of the control rod block function if these changes are implemented.
In addition, there will be a negligible impact on the plant core melt frequency due to the decreased testing.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Section 2.0, ``Summary'' of GENE-770-06-1-A states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Technical bases are provided for selected proposed changes to the instrumentation STIs and AOTs that were identified
in the BWROG Improved BWR Technical Specification activity. These STI and AOT changes are consistent with approved
changes to the RPS, ECCS, and isolation actuation instrumentation. These proposed changes do not result in a degradation
to overall plant safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the generic analysis in NEDC-30851P-A, Supplement 1, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&amp;L concurs
that the proposed changes to Control Rod Withdrawal Block instrumentation do not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Also, based on the generic assessment in GENE-770-06-1-A,
the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&amp;L concurs that the proposed changes to the ATWS-RPT and EOC-RPT instrumentation
do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bases contained in GE Topical Report GENE-770-06-2P-A, assessed the impact of changing STIs and AOTs on BWR RCIC failure
frequency. Section 2.0, ``Summary'' of GENE-770-06-2P-A states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``The STI and AOT changes to the RCIC actuation instrumentation are justified based on their small effect on the water
injection function unavailability and consistency with comparable changes to actuation instrumentation for the
other ECCS subsystems.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On this basis, the BWR Owners' Group concluded and CP&amp;L concurs that the proposed changes to RCIC instrumentation
do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not
create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not alter the physical characteristics or function of any plant systems or components and
they do not introduce any new mode of operation. Therefore, system and component performance would not be challenged
in a manner that could create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Operation of Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed and approved the generic studies contained in the LTRs and has concurred with the BWR Owners'
Group that the proposed changes do not significantly affect the probability of failure or availability of the affected
Instrument Systems. The proposed changes to AOTs provide realistic times to complete the required actions without
increasing the overall instrument failure frequency. Likewise, the extended STIs do not result in significant changes
in the probability of instrument failure. Furthermore, the proposed changes will reduce the probability of test-induced
plant transients and equipment failures. Finally, instrument setpoint drift will remain within present tolerances,
thereby assuring that the margin of safety, as demonstrated by applicable safety analyses, remains unchanged. Therefore,
it is concluded that the proposed changes would not result in a reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The requested change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The requested change will have no influence on the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The accident of concern to this requested change is a turbine overspeed with missile generation
impacting safety related components or structures. The evaluation in WCAP-11525 shows that the probability of a
missile ejection incident will not be affected with the requested frequency reduction to the turbine overspeed protection
valve surveillance test. There is no change to the consequences of the event as the postulated accident event is unchanged.
Accordingly, the requested change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of
an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The requested change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The change affects the test interval for the turbine overspeed protection valves and does not change the
design, operation, or failure modes of the valves and other components in the turbine overspeed protection system.
Therefore, the requested change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The requested change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The probability of turbine
overspeed with an extension of the testing interval has been determined to be within applicable acceptance criteria.
The change does not affect the design, operation, or failure modes of the valves or other components in the turbine
overspeed protection system. Accordingly, the requested change will not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would allow an increase to the allowable nominal fuel enrichment from 4.2 to 5.0 weight percent
Uranium-235 (w/o U-235). The changes include: (1) increasing the allowable storage enrichment in Region 1 and allowing
the use of Integral Fuel Burnable Absorbers (IFBAs) for reactivity equivalencing, (2) revising the Region 2 discharge
burnup curve to include nominal fuel enrichments up to 5.0 w/o U-235, and (3) making editorial changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to Section 5 of Technical Specifications do not affect any accident initiators or precursors
and do not change or alter the design assumptions for the systems or components used to mitigate the consequences of
an accident. The fuel enrichment increase will not affect reactor operation or the core design methods. The physical
characteristics of the fuel assemblies are not changed, and fuel assembly movement will continue to be controlled
by approved fuel handling procedures. Reload core designs will continue to be performed on a cycle by cycle bases as
part of the reload safety evaluation process, using NRC approved codes and methods. Each reload design is evaluated
to confirm that the cycle core design adheres to the limits that exist in the accident analyses and Technical Specifications
to ensure that reactor operation is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are consistent with the analysis performed in the ``Criticality Analysis of Byron and Braidwood
Station Fuel Storage Racks.'' The analysis was revised in June 1994 to include boraflex gaps and shrinkage. The revised
analysis is provided in the proposed Technical Specification amendment. The analysis methodology has been previously
accepted by the NRC and is consistent with the appropriate standards to establish the K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 limit for storage racks and to calculate the maximum K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reanalysis addresses the most limiting postulated accident of a misloaded fuel assembly and has shown that having
at least 300 ppm of soluble boron offsets any positive reactivity impacts for any of the postulated accidents. The
concentration of boron in the spent fuel pool water, which is administratively controlled, is sufficient to maintain
K

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than or equal to 0.95. The analysis is bounding for a dropped fuel assembly on top of a rack or between rack modules,
loss of cooling systems, and reduction the fuel pool temperature to less than 50
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The proposed changes do not impact any other accident previously evaluated in the [Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report] UFSAR. There is no postulated accident that could cause reactivity to increase beyond the analyzed conditions
in the spent fuel racks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no impact on the ability of the Spent Fuel Pool cooling system to maintain the bulk pool temperature within
limits. The UFSAR analysis performed to calculate the maximum fuel cladding temperature and spent fuel pool cooling
include assumptions which bound the use of more highly enriched fuel assemblies. Although fuel enrichment is not
a specific assumption in any of these analyses, the heat load of a typical core offload may change with higher enrichments.
The average burnup of the offload will be increased since few assemblies will be used per cycle; however, the new heat
load will continue to be [bound] by the UFSAR analysis because the spent fuel pool racks have been analyzed for a total
core offload with all fuel assemblies having 4.5 years of operating time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The radiological consequences analysis continues to bound the licensed fuel burnup and enrichment at Byron and Braidwood
stations. The radiological consequences analysis results are a function of the core inventory of radioactive isotopes.
Since the maximum fuel burnup limits and fuel peaking factors will not be exceeded, the assumed fission product inventory
will remain valid; therefore, the limits of 10 CFR [Part] 100 continue to be met. Additionally, Byron and Braidwood
addressed the issue of the impact on the radiation levels at the pool surface to the worker during non-accident conditions.
These conditions are not changed as [a] result of this submittal, because the average fuel assembly burnup limit (isotopic
inventory) and maximum power produced in each fuel assembly will not be changed by the increased fuel enrichment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the design or operation of any system, structure, or component in the plant. There
are no changes to parameters governing plant operation; no new or different type of equipment will be installed. Each
reactor core design will continue to meet all design requirements; operation of the core will not be affected. No modifications
to the spent fuel pool are being pursued and the fuel parameters used in the analysis remain bounding. The method and
manner in which the fuel will be stored in the spent fuel pool has not changed. The proposed changes ensure that 17X17
(Optimized Fuel Assembly, VANTAGE 5, VANTAGE +, and PERFORMANCE +) fuel assemblies can be safely stored, maintaining
a K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than or equal to 0.95 under full water density conditions, in both Regions 1 and 2 of the spent fuel pool. All design
criteria and criticality acceptance criteria continue to be met. The reanalysis addresses the most limiting postulated
accident (misloaded fuel assembly) and has shown that having at least 300 ppm of soluble boron offsets any positive
reactivity impacts for any of the postulated accidents. The level of boron in the spent fuel pool water, which is administratively
controlled, is sufficient to maintain K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than or equal to 0.95. The reanalysis to increase the storage enrichment of fuel in Regions 1 and 2 of the spent fuel
pool does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, approval of this amendment will not create a new accident with regards to the new fuel storage vault
which is designed to handle the increased enrichment. The Byron and Braidwood new fuel vaults were previously analyzed
using NRC accepted criticality analysis methodology in June 1989. This analysis was performed to increase the storage
enrichment of the New Fuel Vault to 5.0 w/o U-235. The New Fuel Vault analysis was submitted to the NRC and is the current
licensing basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes do not affect the margin of safety for any Technical Specification. All reactor design criteria
will continue to be met. The methodologies used in the accident analyses have been accepted previously by the NRC and
all criticality acceptance criteria have been met under all assumed conditions (normal and accident). The design
basis for preventing criticality outside the reactor is that, including uncertainties, there is a 95 percent probability
at a 95 percent confidence level that the effective neutron multiplication factor, K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, of the fuel assembly array will be less than 0.95 as recommended by ANSI 57.2-1983 and OT Position Paper for Review
and Acceptance of Spent Fuel Storage and Handling Applications, dated April 14, 1978. The analyses for both Regions
1 and 2 fuel storage were verified to meet the above design basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criticality analysis for Regions 1 and 2 has been revised to allow for storage of fuel assemblies with enrichments
up to 5.0 w/o U-235. The proposed Technical Specification changes include those changes necessary to maintain K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 less than or equal to 0.95, including conservative allowances for uncertainties and biases, when the pool is flooded
with unborated water. The proposed changes include a requirement for fuel assemblies with enrichments above 4.2
w/o U-235 to contain sufficient integral fuel burnable absorbers such that the maximum reference fuel K infinity
is less than or equal to 1.470 in unborated water at 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F due to restrictions on spent fuel storage. Should a postulated accident occur which causes a reactivity increase
in the Byron and Braidwood Spent Fuel Pools, K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be maintained less than or equal to 0.95 due to the presence of at least 300 ppm of soluble boron in the spent fuel
pool. The proposed changes do not affect any plant safety parameters or setpoints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes ensure that the design basis for preventing criticality in the fuel storage areas is preserved,
and fuel cycle designs will continue to be analyzed using NRC accepted codes and methods to ensure the design bases
are satisfied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
YAPCO and NNECO have reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and conclude that the changes do
not involve a SHC [significant hazards consideration]. The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are not compromised. The proposed changes do not involve an SHC because the changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation of the facilities in accordance with these proposed changes would require the implementation of the IIS
methodology described in the Program Plans. As such, it requires that CYAPCO and NNECO establish an administrative
means for tracking, prioritizing, and scheduling NRC-required plant modifications and engineering evaluations,
and licensee identified plant improvement projects. This methodology is intended to enhance plant safety by more
effectively controlling the number and scheduling of plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues required
for safe operation of the plants receive priority and are completed in a timely manner. Because the license conditions
address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, it does not affect directly the design or operation of the plant.
Therefore, no accident analyses are affected and the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequences
of any previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license conditions establish a requirement related to scheduling of modifications and engineering
evaluations. Because the license conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, they do not affect
directly the design or operation of the plants. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from those previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license conditions renew administrative requirements intended to enhance public safety and reliable
plant operation. The proposed license conditions do not affect any accident analyses, directly modify the plant
configurations, or change the way the plants are operated. The methodologies are intended to enhance plant safety
by more effectively controlling the number and scheduling of plant modifications, thereby assuring that issues
required for safe operation of the plants receive priority and are completed in a timely manner. Because the license
conditions address only an administrative scheduling mechanism, they do not affect directly the design or operation
of the plants. Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a reduction in any margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Charging Flow Instrumentation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Charging Flow instrumentation be changed from 18 months
(+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure
that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated from occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A significant reduction in a margin of safety is not involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is
necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump, and Reactor Cavity Continuous Level Instrument Channels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the calibration and test frequency for the Containment Sump, Recirculation Sump and Reactor Cavity
continuous level monitoring instrument channels be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will provide protective functions to assure
that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any previously evaluated from occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. This margin is necessary to assure that protective safety functions
will occur so that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate Channel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the Auxiliary Feedwater Flow Rate channel be revised from 18 months
(+25%) to 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists between the existing technical specification limits and the
licensing basis Safety Analysis limit to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from a 30 month operating
cycle. The existing margin between the Technical Specification limit and the Safety Analysis limit provides assurance
that plant protective actions will occur as required. It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval
from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the current margin between the existing Technical Specification limit and
the Safety Analysis limit. Plant equipment, which will be set at (or more conservatively than) Technical Specification
limits, will provide protective functions to assure that safety analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the margin which exists between the current Technical Specification limit
and the licensing basis Safety Analysis limit. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing margin, is necessary
to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Control Room Air Filtration System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the surveillance frequency for the Control Room Air Filtration System be changed from every 18
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the flow tests, data from 1986 to date indicates that the Control Room Filtration System performed in an acceptable
manner when surveilled on an 18 month (+25%) basis. The only discrepancy was due to a hardware error and was independent
of the time between surveillances. Per Generic Letter 91-04, this past test history provides an adequate basis to
conclude that an extended operating cycle would have minimal impact upon the flow characteristics of the Control
Room Filtration System. The modification of the filtration system in 1993 only enhanced system performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the absorbance properties of the charcoal, previous test data highlights a problem occurring during
the 1986-1987 period which subsequent testing confirms was adequately resolved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the 1993 modification which increased the carbon bed thickness from 1'' to 4'', performance can only be enhanced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is concluded that a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated will not be incurred by changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of past historical surveillance data over 7 years indicates no failures which were time dependent. The modification,
which was performed in 1993, can only enhance performance of the system. New fans, an increased charcoal bed thickness,
and new HEPA [high-efficiency particulate air] filters will increase the reliability of the system. Thus, it is concluded
that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident than that previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past test data validated the acceptability of the previous air filtration system for an extended surveillance interval.
The modification performed in 1993 will only enhance the reliability and performance of the air filtration system.
Thus, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the margin of safety is not involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Post Accident Containment Venting System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the surveillance frequency for the Post Accident Containment Venting system be revised from every
18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of past test history from 1986 to date indicates that the Post Accident Containment Venting System performed
in a satisfactory manner when the surveillance period was 18 months (+25%). There was one discrepant condition noted
in the 1989 test, which, based upon subsequent tests in 1991 and 1993, does not appear to have been age related. The 1989
observation concerning a gasket is considered to be a one time only event and unlikely to reoccur as a result of extending
the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An added consideration, in terms of safety significance, is the fact that the Post Accident Containment Venting system
is diverse and redundant to the post accident hydrogen recombiners which are themselves redundant and the primary
means of reducing the post accident hydrogen concentration within containment. The venting system is not relied
upon for containment pressure control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the satisfactory past test history of the venting system, together with its secondary role as a means of controlling
post accident hydrogen concentration, it is concluded that a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated will not be incurred by changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%)
to 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of past historical surveillance data over 7 years indicates no failures which are considered to be time dependent.
Although one discrepant condition was observed in the 1989 test it was not repeated in subsequent surveillances.
Per Generic Letter 91-04, this constitutes a sufficient basis for revising the surveillance interval from 18 months
(+25) to 24 months (+25%). This extension in the operating interval is not expected to have an impact upon the availability
of the system. Thus, it is concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously evaluated
has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As past test data validates the presumption that an extended operating cycle will not impact the availability of the
Post Accident Containment Venting Systems, it is concluded that a significant reduction in the margin of safety is
not involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Liquid Rad-Waste Flow Channel be revised from every
18 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds current margin. Plant equipment will be set to provide protective functions
to assure that Safety Analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated from occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above change in surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a channel
statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing
margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not
exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Steam Generator Blowdown Flow Channel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Steam Generator Blowdown Flow channel be revised from
every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from
a 30 month operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required.
It is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to the existing
margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that Safety Analysis limits are not
exceeded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the channel calibration frequency for the Liquid Waste Distillate Tank level of tanks 13 and 14
be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the channel statistical error resulting from

A statistical analysis of channel uncertainty for a 30 month operating cycle has been performed. Based upon this analysis
it has been concluded that sufficient margin exists to accommodate the statistical error resulting from a 30 month
operating cycle. The existing margin provides assurance that plant protective actions will occur as required. It
is therefore concluded that changing the surveillance interval from 18 months (+25%) to 24 months (+25%) will not
result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in operating cycle length due to an increased surveillance interval will not result in a statistical
allowance which exceeds the current margin. Plant equipment will be calibrated to provide data to assure that safety
analysis limits are not exceeded. This will prevent the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an previously
evaluated from occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change in the surveillance interval resulting from an increased operating cycle will not result in a
channel statistical allowance which exceeds the allowable operating margin. This margin, which is equivalent to
the existing margin, is necessary to assure that protective safety functions will occur so that safety analysis limits
are not exceeded.

(11) Stack Vent Noble Gas Activity Monitor (R-60)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the calibration frequency for the stack vent noble gas activity monitor be revised from every 18
months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current monitor replaced the previous monitor and therefore there is only one refueling cycle surveillance data
available which proved to be satisfactory. The vendor recommends a calibration period based on user experience.
Insofar as the 18 month (+25%) surveillance has proven to be acceptable, extension to a 24 month (+25%) cycle is consistent
with the vendor's recommendation. Any additional uncertainty generated due to the extended surveillance is bounded
by the uncertainty inherent in a grab sample taken once per 24 hours which is the required compensatory action should
the monitor be inoperable. Since setpoints for alarms are not critical to either plant operation or safety, since
extensive margin is reflected between the setpoint and applicable limits, it is concluded that any additional uncertainty
involved in a longer surveillance cycle will not result in a significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This monitor measures the activity of potentially radioactive gaseous effluent through the stack vent. The alarm
setpoints are set at a point sufficiently above expected radioactivity levels to avoid unnecessary alarms and, at
the same time, far below discharge limits. The purpose of the monitor is to annunciate in the event an unexpected spike
in radioactivity level should occur so that corrective action can be taken prior to exceeding a discharge limit. The
margin that exists between the discharge limit and the setpoint is more than sufficient to accommodate any drift that
could be practically expected in a 24 month (+25%) operating cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this capacity, the monitor does not have setpoints which are critical to plant operation or safety. Readings are
not used in a quantitative manner nor is accuracy important. It is important that the instrument remain operable and
respond to step changes in radioactivity level over the operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that an extended
operating cycle will not result in the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sufficient margin exists between plant setpoints and applicable limits to accommodate any realistic drift projected
to occur over a 30 month operating cycle. Furthermore, instrument indications are not used in a quantitative manner
nor is instrument accuracy of importance. Therefore, it is concluded that no significant reduction in the margin
of safety will result from an extended operating cycle.

(12) High Pressure Water Fire Protection System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the system functional test of the High-pressure Water Fire Protection System be changed from every
18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system is a static system which is not normally required to operate. The main fire pumps are on standby and are not
in operation except for testing. Thus, almost no wear is induced as a function of time except that which results from
being in standby status which is minimal and slow acting. Under these circumstances, extending the operating cycle
between surveillances would be expected to have negligible affect upon system operability. It is therefore concluded
that there would be no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as a result of an extended
interval between surveillances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extension of the plant operating cycle will primarily extend the time the pumps are in standby capacity. The potential
for system deterioration is minimal under these circumstances. Any deterioration that does occur will be slow acting
with respect to time. A significant deterioration would be detected by a monthly pump operating test. Thus, an extended
operating cycle is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident form [from] any previously
analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extension of the operating cycle by several months only serves to extend the period of time when the pumps are in standby
status. Any deterioration under these circumstances will be slow acting. Significant deterioration would be detected
by the monthly operating test. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended interval between surveillances will involve
no significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Fire Protection System Diesel Engine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the Fire Protection System Diesel Engine Functional test be changed from every 18 months (+25%)
to every 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except for periodic testing, the diesel is in a standby state and not subject to operational stress. Periodic testing
imposes limited wear as evidenced by the absence of major repairs during past maintenance. Extension of the operating
cycle for several months is expected to have virtually no impact upon diesel operability. Monthly testing would detect
any degradation. Thus it is concluded that there would be no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident as a result of an extended interval between surveillances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extension of the plant operating cycle will, for the most part, only extend the time spent by the pumps in standby capacity.
The potential for system deterioration is minimal under these circumstances. Any deterioration that does occur
will be slow acting with respect to time. Significant deterioration in performance would be detected by the monthly
pump operating test. Thus, an extended operating cycle is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extension of the operating cycle by several months only serves to extend the period of time when the pumps are in standby
status. Any deterioration under these circumstances will be slow acting and significant deterioration would be
detected by the monthly operating test. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended interval between surveillances
will involve no significant reduction in the margin of safety.

(14) Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building, and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems; (A)
System Functional Test and (B) Spray Header Visual Inspection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) It is proposed that the functional test surveillance interval for the Electrical Tunnel, Diesel Generator Building
and Containment Fan Cooler Fire Protection Spray Systems be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months
(25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) It is proposed that the Spray Header visual inspection interval be revised from every 18 months (25%) to 24 months
(+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extension of the surveillance interval for Electrical Tunnel and Diesel Generator Building Fire Protection System
functional tests will have virtually no impact upon the operability of these systems. These systems are accessible
during normal operation and other sections of the Technical Specifications (4.14.A.1.g.(i) and 4.14.B.1.a(i))
require that the system valve tests be conducted on an annual (12 month) basis. These annual tests would reveal any
system deterioration prior to the conclusion of the proposed extended surveillance interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Fan Cooler Fire Protection System as well as the Spray Header itself, evaluation of surveillance data from
the past five refueling outages indicates minor discrepancies which would not have impaired system operability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore concluded that extension of the proposed surveillance interval will not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Electrical Tunnel and Diesel Generator Building, extension of the surveillance interval will have a negligible
affect as other portions of the Technical Specifications require the same surveillance on an annual basis. For the
spray header and the fan cooler fire protection system, historical surveillance data validates operability over
an 18 month (+25%) interval which lends confidence to conclude that operability will be maintained over a 24 month
(+25%) interval. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated has not been introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extension of the surveillance for two systems will have minimal impact as the Technical Specifications impose more
frequent testing for system valves on an annual basis. For the Spray Header and Fan Cooler Fire Protection System,
as well as the fire protection system for the Diesel Generator Building and Electrical Tunnel, it can be stated that
these systems are static existing mainly in a standby capacity under which little deterioration would be expected.
Past surveillance data validates system reliability. It is therefore concluded that increasing the time interval
between inspections would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) Penetration Fire Barriers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the visual inspection frequency of the penetration fire barriers listed in the Technical Specifications
be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fire barrier penetration seals are static devices existing in standby status. Normal environmental conditions
exist during normal plant operations. The only deterioration expected would be that due to aging in a normal ambient
which would be minimal to non-existent. Evaluation of unacceptable seals detected during surveillances indicates
that initial seal installation was faulty and aging was not the cause. Surveillances during four refueling outages
confirm this evaluation. Accordingly, it is not expected that the proposed change in surveillance interval will
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past surveillances indicate that time is not a predominate failure mechanism. In the few unacceptable seals detected,
the initial installation procedure has been identified as the cause of the problems. Since the seals are static devices
which exist in a standby condition and experience normal ambient conditions during normal operation, this would
be the expected conclusion. In addition, the fire barriers are just one means of fire protection. Other means of fire
protection exist such as fire alarms, sprinklers and heat detectors which provide defense in depth. Thus, it is concluded
that the proposed change in the surveillance interval will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of
accident from that previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aging has not been identified as a principle contributor to seal failures. In addition, there exists additional means
of fire protection which provides defense in depth. Therefore, the proposed change in surveillance intervals is
not expected to involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) Smoke Detectors/Electrical Penetration Area Inside Containment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the surveillance interval for the smoke detectors located in the electrical penetration area
inside containment be revised from every 18 months (+25%) to every 24 months (+25%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data taken from six surveillances from 1984 through and including 1993, these devices have proven to be highly
reliable. No test failures were observed during this period. Based on the guidance contained in Generic Letter 91-04,
this demonstration of reliable performance provides an adequate basis to conclude that the proposed extension in
the surveillance interval will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only 3 of the 5 detectors are required during normal operation. Past surveillance data from six refueling outages
indicate that it is reasonable to expect all 5 detectors will remain operable over the extended operating cycle which
provides margin. It is therefore concluded that the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proven reliability of these devices indicates that a significant reduction in the margin of safety would not be
involved in extending the operating cycle to 24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) Functional Testing of Containment Sump Pumps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the functional test of the Containment Sump Pump be changed from every 18 months (+25%) to every
24 months (+25%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No credit is taken within the FSAR for the Containment Sump Pumps as a means of mitigating the consequences of an accident.
During normal operation the pumps serve as a means of quantifying leakage inside Containment and therefore serve
a safety function in terms of accident prevention. However, in this capacity they are only one of several systems which
are capable of serving this function and their failure would not result in a loss of this capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, evaluation of surveillance data back to 1986 indicates, with one exception, that the devices are very
reliable. In one instance, the pumps did not actuate or cause operation within the setpoint tolerance but did operate
as required. This was determined not to be a time dependent event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore concluded that extending the interval between refueling surveillances will not result in a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past surveillances indicate that time is not a predominate failure mechanism. Also, there exists a Technical Specification
requirement to perform almost the same surveillance on a monthly basis in addition to every refueling outage. This
monthly test diminishes any potential risk in extending the operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past surveillance data indicates that pump operation is reliable. In addition, there are alternate means of providing
the safety function fulfilled by these pumps. Also, a monthly test is required which would detect any malfunction
prior to the end of an extended operating cycle. It is therefore concluded that extending the operating cycle by several
months will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments will upgrade existing TS 3/4.6.2.1 and TS 3/4.6.2.3 by adapting the combined specification
for Containment Spray and Cooling Systems, contained in the Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering
Plants, to the St. Lucie units. The changes account for plant-specific differences and include all related requirements
of NUREG-1432, Rev. O, specification 3.6.6A. Accordingly, the proposal is consistent with the Commission's Final

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase
in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will upgrade the existing Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCOs) associated with the Containment
Cooling and Spray Systems to be consistent with NUREG-1432, Standard Technical Specifications for Combustion Engineering
Plants. The Containment Cooling and Spray Systems are not initiators of accidents previously evaluated, but are
included as part of the success paths associated with mitigating various accidents and transients. The redundancy
afforded by Containment Cooling and Spray Systems in conjunction with the requirements of the proposed LCO assures
that the safety function of these systems can be accomplished considering single failure criteria. Neither the design
nor the safety function of the Containment Cooling and Spray Systems have been altered, and the proposed amendment
does not change the applicable plant safety analyses. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
The changes are administrative in nature in that they do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification
of existing equipment, nor do they otherwise alter the design of St. Lucie Unit 1 &amp; 2 systems. Therefore, operation
of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function of the Containment Cooling System is to provide containment heat removal during normal operation
and accident conditions. The safety function of the Containment Spray System is to provide containment heat and iodine
removal during accident conditions. The proposed amendment, in conjunction with the redundancy afforded by the
Containment Cooling and Spray system design, assures that these safety functions can be accomplished considering
single-failure criteria. The bases for required actions and the action completion times specified for inoperable
Containment Cooling and Spray trains are consistent with the corresponding specifications in NUREG-1432. The safety
analyses for applicable accidents and transients remain unchanged from those previously evaluated and reported
in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed
amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

In addition, changes to certain system specifications that are affected by the changes for the emergency power supply
were also proposed.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The equipment which is affected by the technical specification changes proposed here are not precursors to any accident
postulated to occur in Modes 5 and 6. Therefore, the probability of an accident is not increased. A design review has
demonstrated the ability of the required systems to perform their accident mitigation functions for the postulated
accidents during Mode 5 and 6 operation. Therefore, it is concluded that an increase in the consequences of the postulated
accidents will not result from the proposed Technical Specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The system design, function, and performance is not affected by these specifications. No new equipment interactions
are created. Calculations and Failure Modes and Effects Analyses (FMEA) have been conducted for selected mechanical
systems and show there are no failures which would cause situations where applicable accidents would not be mitigated
or which would cause new accidents. On this basis, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The electrical power system specifications support the equipment required to be operable, commensurate with the
current level of safety, including the equipment requiring a diesel backed power source. The design review results
demonstrate that operation in Modes 5 and 6, in accordance with the proposed Technical Specification changes, is
acceptable from an accident mitigation standpoint. The basic Modes 5 and 6 plant system functions are not changed.
On this basis, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to Technical Specification 3.9.4, Containment Building Penetrations, would allow the containment
personnel airlock to be open during fuel movement and core alterations. The containment personnel airlock is closed
during fuel movement and core alterations to prevent the escape of radioactive material in the event of a fuel handling
accident. The containment personnel airlock is not an initiator to any accident. Whether the containment personnel
airlock doors are open or closed during fuel movement and core alterations has no affect on the probability of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change does alter assumptions previously made in evaluating the radiological consequences of the fuel
handling accident inside the reactor containment building. The proposed change allows for the containment personnel
airlock to be open during refueling. The radiological consequences described in this change are bounded by those
given in the South Texas Project Safety Evaluation Report and General Design Criteria 19. All doses for the proposed
change are less than the acceptance criteria, therefore, there is no significant increase in the consequences of
an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will significantly reduce the dose to workers in the containment in the event of a fueling handling
accident by accelerating the containment evacuation process. The proposed change will also significantly decrease
the wear on the containment personnel airlock doors and, consequently, increase the reliability of the containment
personnel airlock doors in the event of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the probability of a fuel handling accident is unaffected by the airlock door positions, and the increased doses
do not exceed acceptance limits, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change affects a previously evaluated accident, e.g., a fuel handling accident inside containment.
The existing accident has been modified to account for the containment personnel airlock doors being opened at the
time of the accident. It does not represent a significant change in the configuration or operation of the plant and,
therefore, does not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is reduced when the offsite and control room doses exceed the acceptance criteria in the STP SER.
As previously discussed in the response to question 1, the offsite and control room doses are below the acceptance
criteria. Therefore, this proposed change does not significantly reduce the margin of safety.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A single charger is able to maintain the operability of Channel I or Channel IV at the design loading with a single failure
condition. The proposed change does not alter equipment or assumptions made in previously evaluated accidents.
The consequences of previously evaluated accidents are not increased. On this basis, the proposed change does not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of accidents previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves only the operability requirement for the second battery charger in Channel I and Channel
IV. The failure modes and operating modes would then be identical for all four STPEGS Class 1E DC channels. Failure
modes and effects analyses already performed for DC Channels II and III would thus become applicable to Channels I
and IV also. The change proposed by this Technical Specification revision is bounded by the failure modes and effects
analysis provided as Table 8.3-8 of the STPEGS UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis Report]. On this basis, the proposed
change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves only the operability requirement for the second battery charger in Channel I and Channel
IV. The number and capacity of DC channels required is not affected by the proposed change. The electrical loads supported
by these DC channels are not changed and the duration of their function is not impacted. On this basis, the proposed
change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident as
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During refueling operations, the Source Range channels are used only for monitoring changes in core reactivity,
and does not provide inputs for automatically actuated equipment. The same function could be performed by an Extended
Range channel. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient
to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. By providing the intended redundant
core reactivity monitoring, neither the possibility or consequences of an accident previously evaluated are increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During refueling operations, the Source Range Monitors are used simply as monitoring instrumentation. Extended
Range Monitors are capable of performing this function. The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed
Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change would require revision of STP refueling procedures. However, the physical movement of fuel assemblies
is within the scope of current refueling procedures. No new mechanism for fuel misloading or damage or boron dilution
would be created by the change. Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change provides core reactivity monitoring comparable to that provided by the use of the Source Range
channels. The Extended Range channel is capable of detecting core reactivity changes and provides the intended redundancy.
The combination of the present Channel Check and the proposed Channel Calibration are sufficient to ensure that the
detectors are capable of monitoring core reactivity changes. No margin of safety is compromised by this change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the  probability or consequences of an accident previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance of Technical Specifications Table 4.1-3 (items 10 a and b) ensures the emergency feedwater flow transmitters
are operable when required. The proposed change will continue to ensure operabililty and therefore will not increase
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency feedwater flow transmitter operability verification is maintained, with no change to the system's configuration.

The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. The changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(1)) because the proposed changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated
and do not change any facility design feature or equipment. Since there is no change to the facility or operating procedures,
there is no affect upon the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. The changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of accident from any accident previously evaluated (10 CFR 50.92(c)(2)) because they do not affect the manner by which
the facility is operated. The proposed changes merely affect audit and review responsibilities and their deletion
or relocation to other controlled documents does not introduce new or different accident scenarios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. The changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety (10 CFR 50.92(c)(3)) because the proposed
changes do not affect the manner by which the facility is operated or involve equipment or features which affect the
operational characteristics of the facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff

The proposed change clarifies the low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) requirements as required by Technical Specification
4.5.A.2.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NNECO has reviewed the proposed change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92 and concluded that the change does not involve
a significant hazards consideration (SHC). The basis for this conclusion is that the three criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c)
are not compromised. The proposed change does not involve an SHC because the change would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LPCI flow surveillance requirement to demonstrate that three pumps can deliver 15,000 gpm does not relate to any
previously analyzed accident. There are no accident scenarios which rely upon three pumps or 15,000 gpm. The existing
scenarios are more limiting in that they rely on, at the most, two LPCI pumps. The actual testing of the pumps in accordance
with the [inservice testing] IST program and Technical Specification 4.13 will not change. The testing of the pumps
currently performed demonstrates that LPCI will function to mitigate the postulated accidents. Therefore, the
elimination of the requirement to demonstrate that three pumps can deliver 15,000 gpm will not involve an increase
in the probability or consequence of any previously evaluated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of a requirement to test the LPCI header instrumentation can not result in an increase to the probability
or consequence of an accident, since no such instrumentation exists, or is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will remove a requirement to perform a mathematical evaluation that provides no safety benefit.
There is no change in the test methodology currently performed. All four LPCI pumps are tested. Deleting the requirement
to verify that three LPCI pumps can produce 15,000 gpm flow does not create the possibility of a new or different type
of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the requirement to test the LPCI spray header instrumentation can not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident, since there is no LPCI header instrumentation. This change corrects an error which was introduced
by an earlier License Amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change to the LPCI testing requirements does not change any of the actual testing, or individual component requirements
which exist for the LPCI system. The change to remove the three pump, 15,000 gpm flow requirement eliminates the need
to calculate a value which provides no relevant information in ascertaining the ability of the LPCI system to perform
its required safety function. The existing testing ensures performance of the LPCI subsystem in accordance with
the accident analysis requirements. The intent of the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement remains
unchanged. Elimination of the requirement to test the LPCI header instrumentation corrects an error introduced
in an earlier License Amendment. No LPCI header instrumentation exists, therefore, no credit was taken for such instrumentation
in determining the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change can not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety since there are no changes to the surveillance
requirements for any of the individual components of the LPCI system.

The amendment would add to the Susquehanna Units 1 and 2 Technical Specifications, isolation signals to Table 3.6.3-1
for the containment isolation valves on the sample lines for the containment radiation monitoring (CRM) and wetwell

system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of the new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not affect any of the postulated initiating events identified
in Chapter 6 and 15 of the FSAR, the Design Assessment Report, the current Reload Analysis or the NRC Safety Evaluation
Report (NUREG 0776).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new CRM and Wetwell Sample System with separate containment sample lines is isolated from the primary containment
under accident conditions. The power and control-power to the CRM from the Class 1E Division I and Division II sources
is through electrical isolation schemes so that failure(s) in the CRM under accident conditions is isolated from
the Class 1E systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System with separate sample lines and isolation valves does represent
a change in the probability of occurrence of a malfunction of equipment. The addition of the auxiliary relay to the
Division I and Division II CAC System containment isolation logic does represent the source of another potential
malfunction in the logic due to the additional relay in the circuit. However, the increase in probability due to the
additional relay is considered to be so small or insignificant that the change is within the error bounds associated
with the original design calculations and does not constitute a significant increase in probability of the overall
system malfunction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not significantly increase the probability of occurrence
or the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important to safety, as previously evaluated in the
SAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 6 and 15 of the FSAR, the Design Assessment Report, the current Reload Analysis and NUREG-0776 were reviewed
to determine if the proposed action had the potential of creating a postulated initiating event which was not within
the spectrum of events which transient or anticipated operational occurrences and accident conditions were analyzed.
The review did not identify a postulated initiating event which would create the possibility for an accident of a different
type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A random single failure in the CRM A or CRM B does not create a malfunction of a different type. A random single failure
in the existing containment isolation circuitry, the new isolation valve control circuitry or the new valve position
indication circuitry for the new containment isolation valves does not create a malfunction of a different type.
The consequences of random single failure of the CRM or the CRM and Wetwell containment isolation valve isolation
signal, control and indication circuitry is the same as the existing consequences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the addition of a new CRM and Wetwell Sample System does not create a possibility for an accident or malfunction
of a new or different type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operability of the primary containment isolation valves for the sample lines to the new CRMs and Wetwell Sample
Rack is governed by Technical Specification Section 3/4.6.3 entitled ``Containment Systems, Primary Containment
Isolation Valves'' with Table 3.6.3-1 establishing the maximum isolation time. The bases for operability of the
primary containment isolation valves is to ensure that the containment atmosphere is isolated from the outside environment
in the event of a release of radioactive material to the containment atmosphere or pressurization of the containment.
This is consistent with GDC 54 through 57 of 10 CFR 50, Appendix A. The bases for the containment isolation within the
time limits specified in Table 3.6.3-1 is for those isolation valves designed to close automatically to ensure that
the release of radioactive material to the environment is consistent with the assumptions used in the analyses for
a LOCA. The new CRM and Wetwell Sample Rack sample line isolation valves are solenoid valves which close immediately
on an accident signal. The proposed action does not affect the operability requirements of Section 3/4.6.3. The margin
of safety as defined in the Technical Specification for the containment isolation valves is not affected.

1. Does the proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures has no relation to probability or consequences
of accidents. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no initiating events in accidents previously evaluated that involve testing of EDGs. Therefore, deletion
of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant increase in the probability of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reduction in the number of test starts decreases EDG component stress and wear and decreases unavailability time
for maintenance and pre and post run checks. The resulting change in EDG reliability and availability is an improvement
toward ensuring the EDGs are capable of fulfilling their functional requirement to provide electric power for safe
shutdown of the plant during loss of offsite power. Furthermore, implementation of the maintenance rule provisions
for performance monitoring and root cause analysis for failures as a basis for establishing corrective actions establish
an alternate reliability basis that is at least equivalent to that established by accelerated testing. Therefore,
deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Does the proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures introduces no new failure modes for the EDGs or other
plant systems and therefore has no relation to creation of accidents. Therefore, deletion of the requirement for
special reporting of EDG failures does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The frequency at which EDG testing occurs does not affect the potential failure modes of the EDGs, which have already
been assessed in the CPSES design. Therefore, deletion of accelerated testing of EDGs does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Does the proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Acceptance limits and failure values are not affected by the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures. Therefore,
deletion of the requirement for special reporting of EDG failures does not involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety impact associated with accelerated testing relates to EDG reliability and availability. A reduction
in the number of test starts decreases EDG component stress and wear and decreases unavailability time for maintenance
and pre and post run checks. The resulting change in EDG reliability and availability is an improvement toward ensuring
the EDGs are capable of fulfilling their functional requirement to provide electric power for safe shutdown of the
plant during loss of offsite power. Furthermore, implementation of the maintenance rule provisions for performance
monitoring and root cause analysis for failures as a basis for establishing corrective actions establish an alternate
reliability basis that is at least equivalent to that established by accelerated testing. Therefore, deletion of
accelerated testing of EDGs does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) Technical Specifications to allow application
of a voltage-based repair limit for the steam generator (SG) tube support plate (TSP) intersections experiencing
outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed change was reviewed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.92 to show no significant hazards
exist. The proposed change will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no TSP restraint) at room temperature conditions show burst
pressures in excess of 5,000 psig for indications of ODSCC with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing
performed on five intersections pulled from the Kewaunee SGs with up to a 2 volt indication showed measured tube burst
in the range of 9,537 to 9,756 psig. Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5 volt indications
show burst pressures in excess of 6,300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material
properties and the minimum strength levels, tube burst capability significantly exceeds the safety factor requirements
of RG 1.121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tube burst criteria are inherently satisfied during normal operating conditions due to the presence of the TSPS.
Test data indicates that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes with through wall EDM notches 0.75 inch
long, when the notch is adjacent to the TSP. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operating conditions, the
criterion that must be satisfied to demonstrate adequate tube integrity is a safety margin of 1.43 times MSLB pressure
differential. From Figure 3-2 of EPRI report TR-100407, the BOC structural limit for 7/8 inch diameter tubing is 9.6
volts. Applying an allowance of 20% for NDE uncertainty and 50% for crack growth rate over an operating cycle results
in a voltage repair limit of 5.6 volts. The proposed repair limit of 2 volts is very conservative when compared to the
5.6 volts taking into account the low average growth rates experienced at Kewaunee and the high tube burst pressures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, a plant specific calculation was performed
to determine the maximum primary-to-secondary leakage during a postulated MSLB event. The evaluation considered
both pre-accident and accident initiated iodine spikes. The results of the evaluation show that the accident spike
yielded the limiting leak rate. This case was based on a 30 rem thyroid dose at the site boundary and initial primary
and secondary coolant activity levels of 1.0 uCi/gm and 0.1 uCi/gm dose equivalent iodine-131, respectively. A leak
rate of 34.0 gpm was determined to be the upper limit for allowable primary to secondary leakage in the SG in the faulted
loop. The SG in the intact loop was assumed to leak at a rate of 0.1 gpm (150 gpd).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the voltage-based repair limit will be supplemented with a projected EOC MSLB leakage calculation
and conditional burst probability assessment. The methodology for performing these calculations will be consistent
with that discussed in the draft GL until final guidance is published. Should the projected MSLB leakage be exceeded
indications will be repaired or removed from service until the projected leakage is less than or equal to 34.0 gpm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the voltage-based repair limit will not adversely affect SG tube integrity. Therefore, the proposed
amendment will not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed voltage-based repair limit will not reduce the overall safety or functional requirements
of the SG tube bundles. The tube burst criteria will be satisfied during normal operating conditions by the presence
of the TSPs. The RG 1.121 criteria that must be satisfied during accident loading conditions is 1.43 times MSLB differential
pressure. Conservatively, the existing data base of burst testing shows that the tube burst margins can be satisfied
with bobbin coil signal amplitudes of about 8.82 volts or less regardless of the depth of tube wall penetration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed repair criteria will be supplemented with a reduced operating leakage requirement of 150 gpd average
through either SG to preclude the potential for excessive leakage during operating conditions. The 150 gpd restriction
will provide for timely leakage detection and plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single
crack resulting in leakage that is associated with the longest permissible crack length. The operating leakage limit
is based on leak-before break considerations, critical crack length and predicted leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SG tube integrity will continue to be maintained through inservice inspections and primary-to-secondary leakage
monitoring. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the voltage-based repair criteria has been demonstrated to maintain tube integrity commensurate
with the RG 1.121 criteria. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable to the staff for meeting GDCs 2, 14, 15, 31 and 32.
This is accomplished by determining the limiting degradation of SG tubing as established by inservice inspection,
beyond which tubes should be removed from service. Upon implementation of the repair criteria, even under the worst
case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSPs is not expected to lead to a SG tube rupture event during normal
or faulted conditions. The most limiting event would be a potential increase in leakage during a MSLB event. Excessive
leakage during a MSLB is precluded by verifying that the expected EOC crack distribution of ODSCC indications at TSP
locations would result in an acceptably low primary-to-secondary leakage. Therefore, the radiological consequences
from tubes remaining in service is a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combined effects of a LOCA plus SSE on the SGs were assessed as required by GDC 2. This issue was addressed for the
Kewaunee SGs through the application of leak-before-break (LBB) principles to the primary loop piping. Based on
the results of this analysis, it is concluded that the LBB is applicable to the Kewaunee primary loops and, thus, the
probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural
design basis of the plant. Excluding breaks in the primary loops, the LOCA loads from the large branch lines were also
assessed and found to be of insufficient magnitude to result in SG tube collapse. Based on these analysis results,
no tubes are expected to collapse or deform to the degree that secondary-to-primary in-leakage would be increased
over currently expected levels. On this basis no tubes need to be excluded from the voltage-based repair criteria
for reasons of deformation resulting from combined LOCA and SSE loadings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing the RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the voltage-based repair criteria will include a 100%
bobbin coil probe inspection of all TSP intersections with known ODSCC down to the lowest cold leg TSP identified.
This will be supplemented by a reduced operating leakage limit, enhanced eddy current data analysis guidelines,
MRPC inspection requirements and a projected EOC voltage distribution. It is concluded that the proposed change
will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Technical Specification (TS) 4.0.5.a. to delete the requirement to obtain prior
written relief from the NRC for inservice inspection (ISI) and inservice testing (IST) of components conducted pursuant
to 10 CFR 50.55a. This change would provide relief from the ASME Code requirement in the interim between the submittal
of a relief request and the NRC's issuance of a safety evaluation regarding the relief request. The change would allow
the plant to operate in accordance with a proposed relief request while the NRC staff completed its review of the relief
request. The licensee has also proposed to modify TS 4.0.5.b. to add a definition for biennial or every-2-year inspection
and testing activities. The definition of biennial or every 2 years will be at least once per 731 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments propose to revise Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.1.1, ``Main Steam Safety Valves,'' and the
associated Bases to (1) increase the as-found setpoint tolerance of Table 3.7-1 for the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs)
from +/- 1 percent to +2 percent and -3 percent; (2) add a footnote to Table 3.7-1 to indicate that the setpoint tolerance
for the lowest set pair of MSSVs will be +1 percent and -3 percent; (3) add a footnote to TS 3.7.1.1 and revise footnote
1 of Table 3.7-1 to clarify that the MSSVs will be left at the lift setting according to Table 3.7-1 within a +/-1 percent
tolerance following inservice testing; (4) add an ACTION statement requiring the plant to be in HOT STANDBY within
6 hours and in HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 12 hours for the case of less than five MSSVs operable per operable steam
generator; (5) require the plant to be in ``HOT SHUTDOWN within the following 12 hours'' instead of ``COLD SHUTDOWN
within the following 30 hours'' per the existing ACTION statement; (6) revise the title of column 1 of Table 3.7-2 to
read ``Number of Operable Safety Valves per Operable Steam Generator,'' instead of ``Maximum Number of Inoperable
Safety Valves on Any Operating Steam Generator, for better readability; and (7) delete the ORIFICE SIZE column of
Table 3.7-1.

The amendment revises the TS by separating the specification for the Internal Containment Spray (ICS) and the Spray
Additive Systems into two distinct specifications. The amendment also removes the requirement that for a spray train
to be operable, a spray pump suction flow path from the additive tank is needed. In addition, the allowable out-of-service
time for the Spray Additive System is increased from 48 hours to 72 hours.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S. Code, chapter 35), this notice announces a request
for reclearance of an information collection. Form RI 25&hyph;37, Evidence to Prove Dependency of a Child, is designed
to collect sufficient information for the Retirement and Insurance Group to be able to determine whether the surviving
child of a deceased Federal employee is eligible to receive benefits as a dependent child.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately 250 RI 25&hyph;37 dependency determinations are made annually. It requires about 1 hour to assemble
the needed documentation. The annual burden is 250 hours.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Evergreen Fund, The Evergreen Total Return Fund, The Evergreen Growth and Income Fund, The Evergreen Money
Market Trust, The Evergreen American Retirement Trust, The Evergreen Municipal Trust, The Evergreen Real Estate
Equity Trust, The Evergreen Fixed Income Trust, and The Evergreen Foundation Trust are Massachusetts business trusts
and are registered open-end management investment companies. The Evergreen Limited Market Fund, Inc. is a Maryland
corporation and is a registered open-end management investment company. The Evergreen American Retirement Trust,
The Evergreen Municipal Trust, The Evergreen Real Estate Equity Trust, The Evergreen Fixed Income Trust, and The
Evergreen Foundation Trust (collectively, the ``Trusts'') currently offer their shares in separate series.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Evergreen Funds and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Union
National Bank of North Carolina. The distributor of the Funds is Evergreen Funds Distributor, Inc., a subsidiary
of Furman Selz Incorporated. Applicants request relief on behalf of applicants and any existing
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof representing a separate investment
portfolio for which the Adviser, or an entity controlled by or under common control with the Adviser, serves now or
in the future as investment adviser (collectively, the ``Funds'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Evergreen Funds are the only investment companies existing on the date of this application which currently intend
to rely on the requested order. First Union National Bank of North Carolina, the Adviser's parent, acts as investment
adviser to First Union Funds. While First Union Funds do not currently intend to rely on the order requested in this
application, they may do so in the future, subject to the representations and conditions in the application.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Funds currently offer one class of shares (the ``Existing Class''). The Existing Class is not subject to any
sales or redemption charges and is not subject to any charges pursuant to a plan adopted in accordance with rule 12b&hyph;1
under the Act. Shares of the Existing Class have been primarily sold to individuals and institutional investors through
referrals and general media advertisements. Applicants currently propose to establish a multiple class distribution
system that would authorize each Fund to sell four classes of its shares, Class Y, Class A, Class B, and Class C. Applicants
also propose that the Funds be able to create additional classes of shares in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants propose that the current shares of each Existing Class be redesignated as Class Y shares. Class Y shares
will not be subject to any sales charges or fees pursuant to a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan or shareholder services
plan. Class Y shares will be sold solely to (a) all shareholders of record in one or more of the Evergreen Funds prior
to the commencement of the multi-class distribution, (b) institutional investors, and (c) investment advisory
clients of the Adviser or affiliates of the Adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Class A, Class B, and Class C shares will be offered primarily to individual investors. Class A shares will be offered
with a front-end sales load and will be subject to a distribution fee under a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan. Class
B shares will be offered without a front-end sales load, but will be subject to a CDSC and distribution fees under a rule
12b&hyph;1 distribution plan. After a specified period, Class B shares will convert to Class A shares. Class C shares
will be offered without a front-end sales load and also will be subject to a CDSC and distribution fees under a rule 12b&hyph;1
distribution plan. The Class C CDSC will only apply for the first year after purchase and Class C shares will have no
conversion privileges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Each Fund may also enter into servicing agreements (``Shareholder Servicing Agreements'') with broker-dealers,
banks, and financial institutions with respect to each newly created class of shares to provide various shareholder
record keeping, administrative, personal, and support services to their customers. While it is currently anticipated
that payments made under Shareholder Servicing Agreements will be pursuant to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, a Fund may in
the future make such payments pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing plan in the event such a plan
is duly adopted by the Fund in accordance with condition 5 of this application. The services provided under a Shareholder
Servicing Agreement will augment (and not be duplicative of) the services provided by the Adviser or the Fund's custodian.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Each class of shares would be identical in all respects, except for: (a) The impact of expenses described in condition
1 below that are attributable only to certain classes (``Class Expenses''); (b) the fact that the classes will vote
separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan, and if applicable, any shareholder servicing
plan; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) any conversion feature applicable to a class
of shares; and (e) different class designations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. All classes of shares of a Fund will bear Fund or Trust expenses on the basis of the relative net asset value of the classes.
Expenses specific to a class will be allocated to that class. A Fund's investment adviser may choose to reimburse or
waive Class Expenses of certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed
by the Adviser may vary from class to class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously
expected to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder
expectations to reimburse or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In addition, the Adviser may voluntarily waive or reimburse Trust expenses and/or Fund expenses (with or without
a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Trust expenses and/or Fund
expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Trust expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited
to each class of a Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Fund expenses that are waived
or reimbursed would be credited to each class of that Fund according to the relative net assets of the classes. Trust
expenses and Fund expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive
or reimburse Trust expenses or Fund expenses at different levels for different classes of the same Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Because Class Expenses and payments made under a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder
services plan may differ for each class, the per share net income of, and dividends on, each class may differ from the
net income of, and dividends on, the other classes of shares of a Fund. In addition, except for Funds that seek to maintain
a stable net asset value and declare dividends daily, the net asset value attributable to each class of shares of a Fund
may differ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Shares of a class of one Fund will be exchangeable for shares of the same class of another Fund. Any exchanges will
comply with the provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Shares of certain classes, including Class B and Class C, may be subject to the imposition of a CDSC if they are redeemed
within a prescribed time after their purchase (the ``CDSC Period''). The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as a
specified percentage of the lesser of the net asset value at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. No CDSC will be imposed on amounts representing increases in the value of shares due to capital appreciation, redemptions
of shares acquired through reinvestment of dividends or capital gain distributions, or redemptions of shares held
by longer than the CDSC Period. In determining whether the CDSC is payable, it will be assumed that shares not subject
to the CDSC are redeemed first and that other shares are then redeemed in the order purchased. This will result in a charge,
if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. If a shareholder pays a CDSC upon redemption and a reinvestment occurs within a specified time period stated in
the prospectus in effect at the time the shares are sold, the shareholder may receive a credit, paid by the distributor,
for any CDSC paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC on certain redemptions. Any waiver of the CDSC will comply
with the requirements set forth in subparagraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Shares of some classes subject to a CDSC (``Convertible CDSC Shares'') retained by an investor past a prescribed
period following the purchase of Convertible CDSC Shares will convert into shares of other classes not subject to
a CDSC (``Non-CDSC Shares''). Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid
with respect to Convertible CDSC Shares also will be Convertible CDSC shares, but will convert to Non-CDSC Shares
on the earlier of a prescribed period following the date of such reinvestment or the conversion date of the most recently
purchased Convertible CDSC Shares not acquired through the reinvestment of dividends or other distributions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The sum of any front-end sales charge, asset-based sales charge, and CDSC will not exceed the maximum sales charge
as provided in Article III, Section 26(d) of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers
Inc. (``NASD'').

Applicant's Legal Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act
to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of shares might be deemed to result in the issuance of a ``senior security''
within the meaning of sections 18(g) of the Act and therefore might be deemed to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) and
to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation
of expenses and the voting rights in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any
group of shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of
the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a CDSC with respect
to certain redemptions of shares. Applicants believe that this request would allow shareholders the option of having
more investment dollars working for them from the time of their share purchases than if they invested in a class with
a front-end sales load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and will be identical
in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate
solely to: (a) The impact of the Class Expenses specifically attributable to the particular class which will be limited
to: fees payable pursuant to a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan and/or shareholder servicing plan, if applicable;
transfer agent fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; fees and expenses
of a Fund's administrator that are identified and approved by the trustees or directors as being attributable to a
specific class of shares; printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as
shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders; ``blue sky'' registration fees incurred
by a class of shares; SEC registration fees incurred with respect to a class; the expense of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; litigation or other legal or audit expenses
relating solely to one class of shares; trustees' or directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one
class of shares; and any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to
one class and which are approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately
with respect to a Fund's distribution plan and/or shareholder servicing plan, if applicable, except as provided
in condition 17 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) the conversion feature applicable
only to Class B shares; and (e) the different class designation of each class of shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The trustees or directors of a Fund, including a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors, will approve
the multi-class distribution system. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees or directors of a Fund regarding
their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class distribution system will
reflect in detail the reasons for their determination that the proposed multi-class distribution system is in the
best interests of both a Fund and its shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees or directors of each Fund, including a majority
of the trustees or directors who are not interested persons of a Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation
and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of trustees or directors,
and the trustees or directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the
purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees or directors of a Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the
Act and otherwise, will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes
of shares. The trustees or directors, including a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors, shall take
such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The adviser or distributor
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees or directors. If a conflict
arises, the adviser or distributor at its own cost will remedy such conflict by taking such steps as are necessary,
up to an including establishing a new registered management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Any shareholder services plan that may in the future be adopted with respect to a Fund will be adopted and operated
in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder
were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The trustees or directors of a Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees or directors to justify any distribution
or servicing fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the disinterested trustees or directors in the exercise of their fiduciary
duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution and/or
shareholder service payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class
and any incremental transfer agency costs and other Class Expenses relating to a specific class of shares will be borne
exclusively by that class.

8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends, and distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'')
who has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and
procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On
an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the
calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst,
an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' as defined and described in Statement
of Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and
the ongoing reports will each be a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar accounting standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value, dividends, and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between
the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The prospectus will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive
compensation for selling or servicing shares in a Fund may receive different compensation with respect to one particular
class of shares over another in the same Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants will cause the distributor, and any successor to the distributor, to adopt compliance standards which
govern the circumstances under which each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants
will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
or directors of each Fund with respect to the multi-class distribution system will be set forth in guidelines which
will be furnished to the trustees or directors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective
expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will
contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to each Fund
as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of
shares separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply
SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant
to its rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan or any shareholder services plan a Fund may adopt in the future in reliance
on the exemptive order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class of shares 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans (or adopts or implements any amendment
to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount of asset-based charges
that may be borne by Target Class shares for distribution or shareholder services, existing Purchase Class shares
will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class,
approve the proposal. The directors or trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase
Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material
respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously
were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors or trustees to implement
the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase
Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares
will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares (as well as other future classes
formed for other purposes) may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in
this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors or trustees reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the adviser or distributor.
Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal providing for the payment of higher distribution
and shareholder servicing fees with respect to Target Class shares may convert to Target Class shares subject to the
higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the proposal and the level of the higher distribution
and shareholder servicing fees under the amended Target Class Plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase
Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Applicant was organized as a corporation under Maryland law on April 21, 1983 and dissolved as such on April 7,
1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On June 14, 1983, Applicant filed a registration statement under Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act and, on February 21,
1984, registered under the 1940 Act as an open-end, diversified investment management company. Also on June 14, 1983,
Applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, registering an indefinite number of shares
of Common Stock, $.01 par value. This registration statement was declared effective on February 21, 1984. The initial
public offering commenced February 21, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicant's only security holder was Phoenix Home Life Separate Account B (``Account B''). On August 5, 1992, Applicant's
Board of Directors unanimously approved the transfer of Applicant's assets and liabilities to Separate Account
P (``Account P'') of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company (``Phoenix-Home Life''). Account B and its depositor,
Phoenix-Home Life, voted all outstanding shares in favor of the reorganization, constituting more than two-thirds
of the shares outstanding that was required under Maryland law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. As of October 23, 1992, Applicant has one class of Common Stock outstanding, consisting of 1,239,689.6517 outstanding
shares. The aggregate net asset value of such shares and the net asset value per share were $13,615,073.83 and $10,9856,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On October 26, 1992, Applicant's assets, consisting only of qualified plan assets, were transferred to Account
P, which contains only qualified plan assets. Account B became a contractholder of Account P. Account B and Account
P were not required to be registered under the 1940 Act in reliance on Section 3(c)(11) thereunder. In consideration
for the transfer, Account P assumed all of Applicant's liabilities and delivered to Applicant full and fractional
units of Account P equal to that number of full and fractional units of Account P as determined based on the relative
net asset values of Applicant and Account P as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on October 23, 1992 (the last
business day preceding the reorganization). Applicant distributed Account P units pro rata to Account B and simultaneously
Applicant's shares held by Account B were cancelled. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the transfer
of assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No assets were retained by Applicant after October 26, 1992, and no debts or other liabilities of Applicant remain
outstanding. Applicant has no security holders to whom distributions in complete liquidation have not been made.
Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Phoenix-Home Life, the parent company to the Adviser and depositor of Account B and Account P, paid all of the direct
and indirect expenses of the reorganization, including any brokerage fees relating to transactions resulting from
the reorganization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Other than as described above, during the past 18 months, Applicant has not, for any reason, transferred any of its
assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of the Applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant is not now engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
for the winding-up of its affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicant has made all filings under the 1940 Act, including Form N&hyph;SAR filings, for each period for which
such filings were required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. On May 20, 1992, Applicant's Board of Directors unanimously approved the terms of an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization

5. On October 21, 1992, the Commission issued an order granting an application for exemptive relief from Section 17(a)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. On October 26, 1992, under the terms of the Plan, Applicant transferred its assets on the Growth Series. Under the
Plan, Applicant's security holders, the Separate Accounts, become Growth Series security holders. In consideration

on or after the effective date of the reorganization and delivered to Applicant full and fractional shares of the Growth
Series, par value $1.00 per share, equal to that number of Growth Series share determined by multiplying the outstanding
number of Applicant's shares by the exchange ratio. The exchange ration was the number determined by dividing the
net asset value per share of Applicant's shares by the net asset value per share of the Growth Series shares, such values
determined as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange on October 22, 1992 (the last business day preceding the reorganization).
Applicant distributed such Grow Series shares pro rata to its security holders and simultaneously Applicant's shares
held by its security holders were cancelled. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the transfer of
assets.

A. General Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chicago Match is an electronic order matching system that will cross orders entered by users during regular trading
hours for securities that are listed on the CHX or for which the CHX has unlisted trading privileges. The match will
occur once a day at mid-day. Users may be CHX members or non-members, and will likely include institutional customers,
broker-dealers, and Chicago Match market makers. Users will be able to enter orders directly into Chicago Match through
personal computers and modems. A CHX member must be responsible for controlling and clearing the orders entered by
non-members.

When a non-member is given access to the Chicago Match it must enter into several agreements to ensure that a member
has responsibility and control over the non-member's activities. In addition, non-member users of the Chicago Match
will be required to have $10 million for investment purposes.

The Chicago Match will electronically match users' orders in an allocation procedure described below. If an electronic
match occurs, the trade will be priced at the market price
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 at a random time within a pre-determined ten minute period and will be executed at that time. If a match does not occur,
users will still have the opportunity to find the other side of their orders through participating brokers.

The Chicago Match will primarily operate off the Exchange floor, but CHX market makers may enter guarantees through
their regular terminals on the Exchange floor. Other users will be able to place buy and sell orders directly and anonymously
into the electronic system through off-floor terminals. Quotations from the CHX trading floor will automatically
be fed into the Chicago Match on a real time basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to orders entered by users, Chicago Match will include guarantees by Chicago Match market makers. Theses
market makers will be Exchange members who register with the Exchange to be Chicago Match market makers. As such, they
will be obligated to guarantee a minimum execution size to all users of the system. The minimum size of the guarantee
will be ten thousand shares for the two hundred securities listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on the
Exchange with the highest consolidated trading volume, five thousand shares for the one hundred securities with
the next highest trading volume and two thousand shares for all other securities.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Market maker guarantees automatically will be entered into the Chicago Match at the start of the time for order entry.

C. Priority and Liquidity Fees and Credits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chicago Match permits the use of liquidity fees and liquidity credits to determine the level of priority for order
matching. In the Chicago Match, the size of the liquidity fee or liquidity credit determines the level of priority
for order matching. Those users that are willing to pay the highest liquidity fee will have the highest execution priority
(except for orders that are a part of the CHX quote, which have the highest priority of all orders). Those users desiring
to be paid for providing liquidity will have the lowest priority. Liquidity fees and credits will only be paid when
an order with a liquidity fee is matched with an order with a liquidity credit. When a match occurs, a liquidity fee that
is equal to the size of the liquidity credit will be paid. In all other cases, no liquidity fees will be paid. Users enter
liquidity fees and credits when they enter orders. The Chicago Match will include a default liquidity fee or credit
to be associated with a specific Chicago Match guarantee by a CHX market maker.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Chicago Match market makers can improve this liquidity fee or credit and increase the size of their guarantee before
the cross takes place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>

23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``default liquidity fee or credit'' refers to the liquidity fee or liquidity credit associated with buy and
sell orders in each security in which a Chicago Match market maker is registered, which are automatically entered
into the Chicago Match. The size of each such Chicago Match Market Maker Order shall be equal to the Default Size, which
is the minimum guarantee the market maker must provide. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed Article XXXVII, Rules 2(g) and 6(C).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chicago Match will limit the size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits entered by users. If a liquidity fee is
greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer for the particular security at cross time it will
be reduced to 1/2 of the spread at cross time. For example, if 1/2 of the spread is 61/4 cents, and an order with a liquidity
fee of 10 cents is entered, the maximum liquidity fee that order can pay will be 61/4 cents. Liquidity credits, however,
will be treated differently than liquidity fees. The Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be entered
in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. For example, if the spread of the Consolidated
Best Bid and Offer at cross time was 1/2 (50 cents), the maximum liquidity credit allowed would be 25 cents. If an order
was entered with a liquidity credit greater than 25 cents, the user would have the option of either having the liquidity
credit reduced to half of the spread or having the order excluded from the match.

D. Order Execution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CHX's publicly disseminated bid or offer will be entered into Chicago Match as an order.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Once entered, these orders will have the highest priority for execution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These orders will be entered with a liquidity credit equal to 1/2 of the spread of the consolidated best bid and offer.
These orders will be entitled to full execution ahead of the other orders within the group that have the same liquidity
credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All matched orders will be executed at a random time within a predetermined ten minute window period at the market price
at such time. The Chicago Match will calculate the market price as the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid
and Offer regardless of the size of the spread. For example, if the Consolidated Best Bid and Best Offer of stock X was
20&hyph;201/8, the cross price would be 201/16.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited price orders, orders with a liquidity fee or credit entered in cents, and orders that are entered with a liquidity
fee or credit relative to the Consolidated Best Bid or Offer or as a computed quantity (in addition to liquidity fees
or credits entered in cents) will be eligible to be displayed over the system. The Exchange will assign numeric values
to these orders based on the then current Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. The Exchange anticipates that initially
it will update displayed information at least every fifteen minutes.

In particular, the numerical values of orders entered relative to the Consolidated Bid and Offer will need to be updated
as the market price changes prior to the match.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chicago Match users also may enter linked orders, which are defined as orders whose execution are conditioned on the
execution (or non-execution) of one or more orders. For example, a user may only want to sell stock X if he can buy stock
Z. A user would than link his sell order of stock X to his buy order of stock Z. When the match occurs, the user's order to
sell stock X will only be executed if the user's order to buy stock Z is also executed. Otherwise, both orders will remain
unmatched. The Exchange believes that permitting the linking of orders, and permitting orders that specify a limit
price, will give money managers greater cash management capabilities. The CHX states that this flexibility will
increase the effective match rate of the system relative to that of other crossing systems.

Immediately prior to the match, all orders for a particular security first will be sorted into groups and then each
group will be prioritized for execution. Except for orders that are part of CHX's quote, which will receive the highest
priority for execution, a group will consist of either all buy orders or all sell orders in a security that have the same
liquidity fee or credit. Groups will be prioritized by liquidity fee or credit. Groups will be matched starting with
the group of buy orders with the highest priority. This group will be matched with the group of sell orders with the highest
priority. If the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is the same, all orders in both groups will be matched. If
the aggregate size of all orders in both groups is not the same, orders in the group with the smaller aggregate size will
be allocated among orders in the group with the larger size on a pro-rata basis, except that orders that are represented
as part of the CHX quote will be entitled to complete execution before the remaining orders are allocated on a pro rata
basis. If this results in any order receiving an odd lot or a mixed lot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
265 shares), the amount of shares that order receives shall be rounded down to the nearest round lot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
200 shares). All the odd lots for a particular group shall be aggregated and then allocated to the largest order in the
group. If, after matching orders in a buy group with orders in a sell group, unmatched orders remain in the group of buy
orders, Chicago Match will continue to process of matching this group with successively lower priority groups of
sell orders until all of the orders in the group of buy orders are either matched or are unable to be matched.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After completion of the match described above, Chicago Match will continue to process of matching groups and orders
within those groups, in accordance with the rules described above, starting with successively lower priority buy
order groups until no more matches can be made. Once all of the matches are made, Chicago Match will determine whether
any matched orders are conditional orders and if so, whether their conditions are fully satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A user may enter conditional orders specified in proposed Rule 6(e) of Article XXXVII of the CHX Rules.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 The possible conditions include, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a limit price, linked order condition, minimum size, and/or names of excluded users.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 In the event that certain conditions are not fully satisfied, Chicago Match will remove that order (and any other orders
whose conditions are not fully satisfied). Chicago Match will then erase the match for all orders in that security
and will restart the matching process excluding all conditional orders whose conditions are not fully satisfied
in the last matching process.

E. Near Match Procedures and Floor Broker Participation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chicago Match will allow users to send orders that are not executed in the match to a broker in the event of a ``near
match.'' A ``near match'' occurs when a buyer and seller in the system did not match merely because their required liquidity
fees and credits differed.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 In the event of a ``near match,'' the user will receive an administrative message over the system asking whether the
user wants a predetermined broker to negotiate a trade with another user that has entered similar ``near match'' parameters.
If both parties of the near match wish to negotiate, then the broker (or brokers) will receive a negotiate message.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Users enter their specific ``near match'' parameters when they sign on to the system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``near match'' refers to two orders for a particular security in which the number of shares of each order equals
or exceeds the minimum size specified by the other order and the liquidity credit required by one side is greater than
the liquidity fee offered by the other side. Each user will set its own ``near match'' parameters when it signs on to
the system. An individual user's ``near match'' parameters allow users to decide under what circumstances it should
be contacted by a broker to negotiate a trade which did not match because of varying liquidity fees and credits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange states that because the broker or brokers do not learn anything about the order unless both parties to
the near match have given their approval, the users of the Chicago Match retain complete control during this process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Chicago Match provides another function similar to the ``near match'' function. The system allows
floor brokers to enter a message that, after the daily match, will tell the users of unexecuted orders in a particular
stock of an indication of continuing interest in buying or selling that stock.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 A user would then be free to contact the floor broker to negotiate a trade. Users will have the ability to prevent indications
from appearing on their screens.

``Indications of interest'' would be entered by floor brokers before the cross. The floor broker's ``indication''
would not constitute an order entered into Chicago Match but it would merely indicate that a particular broker may
be interested in negotiating a trade in a particular security.

Users other than Chicago Match market makers will have the option of having their orders displayed to other users of
the system. If a non-market maker user elects to have its order displayed, the order will be displayed under certain
circumstances.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Orders entered by Chicago Match market makers and orders that are part of CHX's quote will not be charged a transaction
fee. Users who display orders will be charged 1/2 cent per share, and all other users will pay 2 cents per share. The Exchange
fee is separate from any liquidity fees and credits.

Chicago Match market makers will be paid 1/8 of a cent per share, per order, when they do not participate in a cross in
their issue so long as the liquidity parameter entered by the Chicago Match market maker is within a pre-determined
range.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE></FOOTCITE>
 This 1/8 of a cent per share fee will be paid by the Exchange out of the 1/2 cent or 2 cent user fee it will receive from users

This range will be determined by the CHX. The Chicago Match Rules provide that the CHX will pay the market maker responsible

In the event that there is more than one market maker in an issue, that 1/8 of a cent per share fee will be paid to the Chicago
Match market maker that enters the highest liquidity fee or lowest liquidity credit. If more than one Chicago Match
market enters the same fee or credit, such fee will be pro-rated. An additional exchange fee will be imposed on all users
equal to the liquidity fee to be paid with respect to a particular order, and an exchange credit will occur that is equal
to the liquidity credit to be received. The clearing broker will collect all fees from institutions and submit the
appropriate amounts to the MCC. In turn, MCC will pay the appropriate amounts to clearing brokers for forwarding to
institutions.

Those orders that have been executed in the cross will be transmitted in a timely manner by Chicago Match to the Exchange
for recordation and reporting to the Consolidated Tape. The CHX will report trades to the Consolidated Tape or Nasdaq,
with one trade report for each stock executed in the Chicago Match. That trade report will include the total number
of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to the cross price plus (or minus) the volume weighted average of liquidity
fees paid (or liquidity credit received) for that stock. Trades will then be cleared by the designated clearing firm.
After receiving an execution report, users will be able to reallocate trades to different clearing brokers, if desired.
Immediately after the cross, users will be notified if their orders have been executed. If an order was not executed,
the user may receive a ``near match'' administrative message, described above.

A. The NYSE's First Comment Letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission received two comment letters on the proposal from the NYSE recommending that the Commission disapprove
the creation of Chicago Match. The first NYSE comment letter, submitted before publication of the amendments to the
CHX proposal, summarizes the Chicago Match, raises concerns about investors' orders, and discusses why the NYSE
believes the CHX proposal is inconsistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act regarding the national market
system's (``NMS'') disclosure and market integration requirements.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE asserts that the Chicago Match would be a facility of the CHX, a national securities exchange, and as such,
the Commission cannot approve the proposal unless it concludes that the Chicago Match is consistent with Sections
6 and 11A of the Exchange Act.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE asserts that the Chicago Match is not a passive order crossing system but rather a private auction being conducted
outside existing exchange facilities that are designed to protect investors.

Section 6 of the Exchange Act governs the activities of national securities exchanges and it sets conditions for registration

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE also believes that the CHX is attempting to operate a form of ``proprietary trading system'' (``PTS'') or
exempt exchange. The NYSE states that the Commission has limited the operation of PTSs and refused to allow national
securities exchanges to operate them. The NYSE asserts that if the Commission decides to approve the Chicago Match
and applies the standards applicable to exempt exchanges and PTSs, it should do so only after a formal review of its
PTS policy. The NYSE further asserts that if such review results in a change of Commission policy, the Commission should
announce that all national securities exchanges are free to offer private systems outside existing NMS regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NYSE expressed concern that the Chicago Match's failure to report the true price to the Consolidated Tape Association
(``CTA'') would mislead investors. The NYSE asserts that the true price of the executions includes liquidity charges.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE disputes the CHX's characterization of the liquidity charges as ``fees,'' asserting that when one investor's
payment is simply passed through to the investor on the other side of the trade, the payment is actually a part of the
price of the security purchased. Thus, the NYSE asserts that the liquidity charges should be included in the price
of the transaction.

price in its Chicago Match marketing material.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE states that the proposal raises two transparency concerns. First, the NYSE asserts that Exchange Act Rule
11Aa3&hyph;1
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 requires all exchanges to file a transaction reporting plan for securities traded through its facilities. Such plan
must provide for the collection and dissemination of ``transaction reports'' that contain, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the price associated with a transaction in a security. The NYSE essentially argues that the original proposal left
open the possibility of liquidity fees not being reported as a part of the price, thus violating Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the NYSE asserts that the CHX is proposing a private auction market outside of the NMS quotation facilities.
The NYSE states that the Chicago Match raises market structure issues similar to the issues it claims are raised by
the ``Selectnet'' System operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'').
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE asserts that both Selectnet and Chicago Match are inappropriately driven by orders that are hidden from public
view and that do not have the opportunity to interact with trading interest from other markets. The NYSE further asserts
that the presence of the ``near match'' function emphasizes that the proposal is merely a hidden auction market conducted
outside of the NMS because the ``near match'' function allows the participants to have a broker negotiate the transaction
outside of the auction process. The NYSE concludes that, while the Commission has sanctioned this result in the case
of PTSs, there is no precedent for allowing a national stock exchange to operate such a ``hidden auction.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE letter also asserts that the Chicago Match violates Exchange Act Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 (the ``Firm Quote Rule''
or ``Quote Rule'').
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE states that, like the Selectnet trading interest, Chicago Match orders that are displayed to other Chicago
Match participants are bids and offers under the Commission's rules because ``bid'' and ``offer'' are defined as
the ``prices communicated by an exchange member *&blank;*&blank;* to any broker or dealer, or to any customer, at
which he is willing to buy or sell one or more round lots of a reported security.''
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE states that Chicago Match users are bidding for and offering stock in accordance with the definition in Rule
11Ac1&hyph;1 and because the trading interest is firm, the CHX must take these quotations into account in calculating
the best bid and offer that it provides to the Consolidated Quote System (``CQS'').

The NYSE states that paragraph (b)(1)(i) of the Firm Quote Rule requires an exchange to collect, process and make available
to quotation vendors the best bid and best offer ``communication on the floor of the exchange .&blank;.&blank;. by

 the trading of a stock in one market at a price inferior to that in another market. Similarly, the ITS ``Block Policy''
provides price protection for quotations at the quoted price when a Block Policy transaction prints at inferior prices.
The NYSE states that the Chicago Match proposal violates these price protection rules. The NYSE further asserts that
the Chicago Match would ``formally bifurcate the retail and institutional markets, allowing large institutional
investors to trade outside the current market, without providing price protection for publicly-displayed retail
customer limit orders.''

The NYSE asserts that the initial proposal

 would allow the Chicago Match to accept short sales and would therefore operate in violation of Exchange Act Rule 10a&hyph;1
(``Short Sale Rule''), which prohibits a short sale at a price below the last different reported price. The NYSE asserts
that the system would allow the seller to sell stock at a price that is actually below the price reported to the tape.

<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE states that pursuant to Sections 5, 6 and 12 of the Act, an exchange can trade only securities that are registered
under the Act (or exempt from registration), and then only if the securities are listed on the exchange or if the exchange
receives UTP.

<FOOTCITE>52</FOOTCITE>
 The second letter states that the proposed amendments fail to address the problems associated with Chicago Match.

First, the NYSE believes that the reporting methodology/plan proposed by the CHX continues to violate the Commission's
rules and the CTA plan. Because the final Chicago Match proposal fails to require a report of the price at which the transaction

thereby violating the reliability of the tape.

In June of 1994, the CHX submitted a letter to the Commission responding to the NYSE's first comment letter.
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 The CHX states that the NYSE requests that the Commission disapprove the Chicago Match because it is different from
floor based trading systems existing on traditional exchanges. The CHX believes that this fact alone should not warrant
Commission disapproval of the Chicago Match. The CHX states that, to the contrary, the ``National Market System envisions
the emergence of different trading vehicles and systems in response to market developments.''

The CHX asserts that the Chicago Match is not a hidden market but is designed to bring together buying and selling interest
on traditional exchanges with institutional trading interest that has preferred to do business on a more anonymous
basis. The CHX also asserts that, unlike a PTS, the Chicago Match is a part of a registered securities exchange and,
therefore, is subject to full Commission regulation, and unlike a PTS, the Chicago Match is integrated with the CHX
trading floor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHX disputes assertions that the Chicago Match actually sponsors hidden quotations that must be disseminated
through CQS. The CHX asserts that buying and selling interest in the Chicago Match does not constitute bids or offers
within the meaning of the Firm Quote Rule. The CHX states that in order to constitute a bid or offer within the purview
of the Firm Quote Rule, an order must be disseminated at a specific price. The CHX states that none of the indications
in the Chicago Match are at a specific price; rather the execution price is a function of the Consolidated Best Bid and
Offer at the randomly selected execution time. As such, the indications are not required to be disseminated pursuant
to the Firm Quote Rule. The CHX asserts that, similarly, the CQS facilities that were designed by the NYSE are incapable
of processing indications without prices. Thus, even if CQS wanted to disseminate Chicago Match indications, it
could not do so.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHX response letter states that, without resolving the issue of whether liquidity fees are a part of the execution
price or not, these fees are reported in cents and thus not reportable on the Consolidated Tape.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 This point, however, has been largely addressed because, as previously noted, the CHX has finalized its tape reporting
process to include reporting of an average weight of liquidity fees. The cross price plus or minus the average liquidity
fee or liquidity credit for each stock stated in up to 1/256ths will be reported to the Consolidated Tape or Nasdaq.
In addition, the maximum liquidity fee or liquidity credit is limited to 1/2 of the spread of the Consolidated Best
Bid and Offer at cross time, regardless of the size of the spread.

The CHX amended its proposal to address the NYSE's concern that trades executed in the Chicago Match could trade through
another market's published quotations if liquidity fees are deemed to be a part of the price. The amendment will change
the cross price of the match to the mid-point between the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer regardless of the size of the
spread and limit the maximum size of liquidity fees and liquidity credits. If a liquidity fee is greater than 1/2 of
the spread of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer at cross time, it will be reduced to 1/2 of the spread at cross time.
The Chicago Match will not permit liquidity credits to be received in an amount greater than 1/2 of the spread of the
Consolidated Best Bid and Offer. The CHX states that these changes will eliminate the possibility of trading through
another market's published quotations.

The CHX states that it disagrees with the NYSE's assertions that the Chicago Match's plan to permit paired orders will
violate Section 12 of the Act. The CHX further states that, while it disagrees with the NYSE's view on this, it has filed
amendments to its rules to preclude orders from being entered in securities not traded on the CHX.

a short sale offer is the best offer in the market. The CHX further states that the Short Sale Rule has never prohibited
the dissemination of quotations reflecting offers to sell short.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CHX also disputes the NYSE's general argument that short sales through the Chicago Match should be prohibited.

through the system cannot impact the market by exerting downward pressure on prices.

After careful consideration of the comments received, as well as applicable statutory provisions, the Commission

and 11A of the Act. Separately, the Division of Market Regulation has granted the CHX exemptions for the Chicago Match
from the Short Sale Rule, the Firm Quote Rule, and Rule 11Ac3&hyph;3.

The Commission believes that the Chicago Match is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1)(B) of the Act which states that
new data processing and communications techniques create the opportunity for more efficient and effective market
operations. The Chicago Match employs significant new information technology and an automated system that adds
to the existing trading facilities of the CHX. As a result, the Chicago Match will serve as an innovative adjunction
to the CHX's existing market structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission historically has encouraged the creation of new electronic trading systems such as the Chicago Match
that may contribute to increased execution alternatives available to investors. At the same time, it is important
to ensure that new exchange trading systems are consistent with the investor protection and fair and orderly market
standards contained in the Act. The Commission believes that the Chicago Match achieves this objective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chicago Match represents a blending of some of the attributes of off-exchange trading systems with the market
making and brokerage features of the CHX trading floor. In addition, it will blend the features of a unitary call market
with the continuous auction of the CHX floor. The operation of such a hybrid system will differ in important respects
from the traditional trading floor design. The Commission disagrees with assertions that these differences would
cause the Chicago Match to violate Exchange Act provisions. While the proposal does involve regulatory issues regarding
transparency, institutional access, and regulatory structure, for the reasons discussed below, the amended proposal
adequately addresses these issues and is consistent with the maintenance of free and open markets and investor protection
in accordance with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.

First, the Commission believes that, contrary to the NYSE's assertions, the Chicago Match is properly regulated
as a facility of an exchange and not as a proprietary trading system.
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 The Chicago Match will use exchange equipment, including software and lines as well as exchange personnel, to run
the system. The Chicago Match will also include CHX market maker participation as well as CHX's Midwest Clearing Corporation
to clear trades. Therefore, the Chicago Match will be using the CHX's premises, property, and services for effecting
and reporting Chicago Match transactions and, thus, will be using the facilities of an exchange as defined in Section
3(a)(2) of the Act.

Section 3(a)(2) provides that the term ``facility'' when used with respect to an exchange includes its premises,
tangible or intangible property whether on the premises or not, any right to the use of such premises or property or
any service thereof for the purpose of effecting or reporting a transaction on an exchange (including, among other
things, any system of communications to or from the exchange, by ticker or otherwise, maintained by or with the consent
of the exchange), and any right of the exchange to the use of any property or service.

Regulating the Chicago Match as a ``facility'' of the CHX is consistent with the approach the Commission has followed
in similar cases. For example, the NYSE's off-hours trading system is regulated as a facility of the NYSE and not as
a separately operated PTS.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, if another exchange wanted to operate a similar system to Chicago Match, it would also be permissible as a facility
of that exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Second, the Chicago Match adequately displays orders and reports prices. The NYSE, in its comment letters, expressed
concern that the Chicago Match transaction prices reported to the Consolidated Tape will be inaccurate due to the
use of liquidity fees and credits, and therefore, Chicago Match would violate Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act. Rule
11Aa3&hyph;1 provides for the collection and dissemination of ``transaction reports'' that contain, among other
things, the price associated with a transaction in a security. The Commission disagrees with the NYSE's concern and
instead believes that, as amended, the Chicago Match is consistent with rules regarding the dissemination of quotations
and reporting of transactions. The amended Chicago Match rules require the CHX to report one trade for each stock executed
in the Chicago Match. This report will include the total number of shares executed in that stock and a price equal to
the cross price plus (or minus) the volume weighted average of liquidity fees paid (or liquidity credits received)
for that stock. This approach will provide public disclosure of liquidity fees by including them, albeit in averaged
form, in the price reported to the tape. The Commission believes that this method informs market participants of the
value of the security including any liquidity fees or credits. The Commission further notes that the block market
currently reports in average prices. The Commission feels that this reporting will provide investors with adequate
transaction price information in compliance with Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act.

The CHX has informed the Division that Chicago Match trades can be reported in up to 1/256ths, thereby allowing for
greater accuracy in this system of volume weighted trade reporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the NYSE asserts that the Commission should not allow the CHX to operate Chicago Match because the bids
and offers on the system are hidden from view, thereby violating the Firm Quote Rule. The NYSE asserts that Chicago
Match orders that are displayed to other Chicago Match participants are bids and offers under Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 of
the Act and, therefore, should be taken into account when the CHX is calculating the best bid and offer that it provides
to the CQS. The Commission disagrees with this assertion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is true that the Firm Quote Rule requires exchanges to collect bids, offers, quotation sizes and aggregate
quotation sizes from ``responsible brokers or dealers,'' as defined in the Act,
<FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>
 for each reported security or each security admitted to unlisted trading privileges and make them available to quotation
vendors, the Commission does not believe that the provisions of this rule apply to the Chicago Match. First, users
of Chicago Match may not always be ``responsible broker-dealers.'' Second, the Firm Quote Rule contemplates bids
and offers at specific prices. The execution prices in the Chicago Match, however, are a function of the Consolidated
Best Bid and Offer at a randomly selected time in the future that is unknown to the users at the time the orders are entered.
Because the execution price also may vary with the addition of liquidity fees and credits, prices are essentially
unspecified. Third, the Firm Quote Rule contemplates dissemination throughout the trading day of bids and offer
quotations with respect to reported securities traded on the trading floor. This will not occur with the Chicago Match,
were orders can be entered and changed without being subject to execution until a single cross time.

Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 defines a ``responsible broker or dealer,'' when used with respect to bids or offers communicated
on the floor of an exchange, as ``any member of such exchange who communicates to another member on the floor of such
exchange, at the location (or locations) designated by such exchange for trading in a reported security, a bid or offer
for such reported security, as either principal or agent.'' The Rule provides, however, that if two or more members
of an exchange have communicated on the floor bids or offers at the same price, each member is a ``responsible broker
or dealer'' with respect to that bid or offer, subject to the rules of priority and precedence then in effect on the exchange.
Furthermore, if a member represents as agent another member's bid or offer, only the member representing the bid or
offer on the floor will be considered the ``responsible broker or dealer.''

The Commission also believes that the near match function does not involve a hidden auction market, but rather is simply
a service provided to cross participants that fail to achieve execution in the match. This service is no different
than a broker negotiating a trade in the crowd on an exchange floor or off an exchange. In the near match function, willing
participants will have the option to have a near match broker call them to negotiate an order. There is no further participation
at this point with CHX or the Chicago Match.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, the CHX has addressed issues relating to its order execution priority. The NYSE expressed concern that trades
executed in the Chicago Match could trade through other markets' published quotations if liquidity fees or credits
are deemed a part of the price. The Commission believes that the amended Chicago Match rules address this issue. As
amended, the Chicago Match rules will limit the maximum size of liquidity fees or credits to one half of the best bid-offer
spread at the time of execution. Therefore, even if the liquidity fees and credits are counted as a part of the execution
price, no market's quotation will be traded through.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also disagrees with the NYSE's assertions that by granting the CHX quote priority the Chicago Match
will allow specialists to trade ahead of customer orders. The NYSE's concern arises in the case where the specialist
enters a proprietary quote. In this instance, it is possible that a specialist could be trading ahead of a separately-entered
customer order. The Commission believes that this possibility is not a significant concern in this context for two
reasons. First, a specialist could not trade ahead of customer orders that he was holding, but only orders that brokers
or other customers separately entered into the system. Second, a customer has the choice to enter an order by sending
it to the CHX floor (in which case it will be displayed) so that his order will be a part of the specialist's quotation
if the customer is concerned about the possibility of a specialist trading ahead of his order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match, as finally amended, will not raise significant short-sale
issues under Rule 10a&hyph;1 of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 The Division has granted the Chicago Match, as amended, an exemption from this rule
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 because the orders that are eligible to be entered into the Chicago Match are not susceptible to the abusive practices
that the rule was designed to prevent. The final Chicago Match rules do not allow short sellers to enter a liquidity
fee, and thus any order to sell short is less likely to be used for manipulative purposes. Moreover, the current Chicago
Match rules provide for order execution at midpoints between the spread, and therefore Chicago Match transactions
will not change the inside market price. In addition, the Chicago Match pricing system is strictly derivative in nature
and thus we believe it is unlikely to lend itself to short-sale abuses.

Paragraph (a) of Rule 10a&hyph;1 covers transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange,
if trades in such security are reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system. A short sale of a reported
security listed on a national securities exchange may not be effected at a price either: (1) below the last reported
price of a transaction reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system (``minus tick''), or (2) at the
last reported price if that price is lower than the last reported difference price (``zero-minus tick'').

provides that a person shall be deemed to own a security only to the extent that the person has a net long position in that
security.

Fifth, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match has adequate controls over non-member access. The Act contemplates
that transactions on a national securities exchange would be conducted by ``members.'' Section 3(a)(3)(A) of the
Act refers to transactions being conducted by various categories of exchange ``members.'' Section 6(c)(1) of the
Act states that national securities exchanges shall deny membership to any person who is not a registered broker or
dealer or any natural person who is not, or is not associated with, a registered broker or dealer.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 The Chicago Match, however, allows non-members to enter orders into the system if a CHX member is responsible for controlling
and clearing these orders.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(a)(3)(A) of the Act also defines members as natural persons permitted to effect transactions on the floor
of the exchange without the services of another person acting as a broker (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 an exchange member such as a registered trader).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the Chicago Match does not violate the Act by allowing some limited non-member access
to its system. First, a non-member entering orders may only do so after arranging with a CHX member to be legally responsible
for the orders the non-member enters into the Chicago Match. The non-member must notify the CHX of this arrangement
with the CHX member.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, each non-member must enter into a Non-Member User's Agreement with the CHX wherein the non-member agrees
to be bound by the applicable rules of the Exchange. The CHX asserts that the Non-Member User's Agreement, by its express
terms, gives the Exchange control over non-member users. This agreement states that the CHX has ``the right to terminate
the user's use of, and access to, the Chicago Match, without prior notice for any reason *&blank;*&blank;* or no reason
whatsoever.'' The CHX states that this authority to remove the non-member user's Chicago Match terminal will allow
the Exchange to act quickly to react to any problems with a non-member user. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the CHX asserts that there will be supervision over non-members through the use of the clearing agreement.
<FOOTCITE>68</FOOTCITE>
 This agreement provides that the clearing member agrees to clear all trades for the non-member users up to a specified
dollar amount. Each user's maximum user threshold will be programmed into the Chicago Match to prevent the non-member
user from exceeding its threshold. Orders that exceed the programmed threshold will be rejected and will not be included
in the match. Clearing members will review daily reports of trades in the system which will allow for the early detection
and correction of problems.

The CHX also states that the clearing member can terminate the non-member user's access to the Chicago Match by terminating
the give-up agreement at will and this would cause the CHX to immediately terminate the non-member user's access to
Chicago Match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission agrees with the CHX's assertions that non-member use of the Chicago Match can be analogized to non-member
access to the NYSE's Designated Order Turnaround System (the revised system is now referred to as ``SuperDot'').
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 The NYSE's SuperDot System allows computer terminals to be placed with the customers of members who may then send their
orders directly
<FOOTCITE>71</FOOTCITE>
 to the NYSE for processing. SuperDot requires NYSE members to monitor customers' electronic orders and to provide
the exchange with an acknowledgment statement indicating their responsibility for orders.
<FOOTCITE>72</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that: (1) the requirement that Chicago Match users gain access only through an arrangement
with a CHX member, which has legal responsibilities as to all user activities described above; (2) the Chicago Match's
clearing thresholds for non-members; (3) the ability to immediately terminate a user's access to Chicago Match;
and (4) the fact that CHX matches currently will occur only once a day,
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 all serve to assure sufficient control by CHX members over the activities of non-members to satisfy the requirements
of the Act.

The SuperDot System is an electronic order-routing system that enables NYSE members and their customers to quickly
transmit market and limit orders in all NYSE-listed securities directly to the specialist post where the securities
are traded, or to the member firm's booth. After the order has been executed in the auction market, a report of execution
is returned directly to the member firm office over the same electronic circuit that brought the order to the trading
floor, and the execution is submitted directly to the comparison system.

The CHX has indicated that it may wish to add more matches, upon Commission approval. The CHX would have to submit a proposal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Commission believes that the Chicago Match is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act which requires
the equitable allocation of reasonable dues and fees among members and persons using exchange facilities. The differentiation
of fees between displayed and non-displayed orders is reasonable in that it is intended to encourage the display of
orders. Likewise, the payment of fees to market makers is reasonably intended to provide incentives for market makers
to provide liquidity to the system and increase the match rate.

V. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the Commission believes that the CHX has presented a proposal that satisfies the standards under the Act
relating to national securities exchanges. In analyzing the CHX proposal, the Commission recognizes that the Chicago
Match is a mixture that brings together features of a call market with the market making capabilities of the CHX floor.
Obviously, such systems represent certain challenges in fitting into the traditional regulatory mold envisioned
for an exchange system under the Act. For the reasons discussed above, however, we believe that the CHX has adequately
addressed the transparency, institutional access, and auction market trading concerns. The combination of the
limited nature of the proposal as a once-a-day call market, the integration of the CHX quote into the match, the limitations
designed to prevent trade throughs of the Consolidated Best Bid and Offer, the reporting of trades to the tape including
average weighted liquidity fees and credits, the limitations of access through agreements with a CHX clearing member,
and the fee structure to encourage the display of orders during the match, all lead the Commission to conclude that
the proposal is consistent with the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule change (SR-CHX&hyph;93&hyph;19) be, and hereby is approved.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 5.8 to permit the listing of options with a duration of up to 60 months (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit the Exchange to list options with a duration of up to 60 months (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 five years). The Exchange presently has authority to list long-term equity options (``LEAPS'') that expire from
12 to 39 months from the time they are listed.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange represents that there has been increasing member firm and customer interest in longer term instruments.
Therefore, the Exchange is proposing to amend Exchange Rule 5.8 to permit the listing of options that expire up to 60
months from the time they are listed. In addition, the Exchange proposes to amend Rule 5.8 to allow up to ten additional
expiration months for LEAPS, as opposed to the six additional months currently allowed.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on August 1, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to amend Rules 1033 and 1066 to allow spread priority for
eligible spreads between two different foreign currency options (``FCOs''). For example, a Deutsche mark call and
a French franc put could be executed as a spread, such that the bid/offer could be expressed as a net credit or debit and
a single execution could occur as long as at least one individual component (leg) of each spread is executed at a better
price than the established bid/offer and no leg is executed outside of the established bid/offer for that option contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to permit the execution of inter-currency spreads, a definition of this type of order is proposed to be added
to Phlx Rule 1066, as a subcategory of ``spread'' orders, which is a subcategory of ``hedge'' orders. Also, the Phlx
proposes to adopt new paragraph (i) to Rule 1033, which establishes spread priority principles for inter-currency
spreads. On November 18, 1994, the Phlx filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal to renumber a proposed paragraph due to
recent changes to Rule 1033.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, an option spread is executable as a single transaction at a total net debit or credit with one contra-side,
pursuant to Phlx Rule 1033(d). Under this provision, an eligible spread can be afforded spread priority as long as
the net credit/debit improves the established market for the spread as measured by the aggregate price of the respective
legs if executed individually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recently approved a Phlx proposal to expand the spread priority provisions applicable to FCOs to include
three-way, ratio, and multi-spread transactions.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, that proposal expanded upon the existing requirement (in Rule 1033(d)) to improve the established
market as follows: at least one options leg must be executed at a better price than the established market for that option
as well as that no option leg be executed outside of the established market for that option.

As a result, according to the Phlx, the net credit/debit necessarily improves the established market for the spread
(the current standard), because the market for at least one leg is bettered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposal is to extend spread priority to spreads involving two different foreign currency options.
For example, a spread could be executed between any two FCOs, American-
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 or European-style
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 expiration, and any expiration date (regular, month-end, or long-term). Inter-currency spread priority pursuant
to the proposed rule change would not, however, be available for cross-rate, cash/spot, or the Exchange's customized
FCOs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to the Phlx, absent spread priority, inter-currency spreads can be executed as contingency orders pursuant
to Phlx Rule 1066. For example, an FCO floor broker would quote a French franc market as well as a Swiss franc market,
in each respective trading crowd; then, the floor broker would announce ``99 bid for 99 Sep 99 French franc calls if
i can sell 99 Dec 99 Swiss franc puts at 99.'' However, each component of the spread, however, must be bid/offered individually,
which, according to the Exchange, generally means that each component is executed at a price better than the established
bid/offer. In addition, the Exchange believes that because each leg must be executed between the established market,
such contingency orders are more likely to be broken up by market interest in one leg, such that the end result may be
a different number of contracts for each leg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 1066(f)(1) defines a spread as an order to buy a stated number of option contracts and to sell the same number of
option contracts, in a different series of the same class of options. The Exchange now proposes to adopt Rule 1066(f)(1)(A)
to define inter-currency spreads because the existing definition requires that both orders be for the same class
of FCOs, which does not allow for spreads involving FCOs in different currencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that executing inter-currency spreads subject to a spread priority provision is appropriate
for several reasons. First, inter-currency spreads provide a trading strategy for FCO market participants based
on the interplay between the currencies of two countries, similar to the advantages and opportunities associated
with cross-rate FCOs. The Exchange believes that the availability of such strategies should enhance liquidity in
existing FCOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Phlx emphasizes that inter-currency spreads are not a new trading strategy, as they are currently executable
as two separate, contingent orders. Instead, inter-currency spread priority is intended to facilitate the execution
of such orders, which, according to the Exchange, often proves to be difficult. For example, the execution of inter-currency
spreads as contingency orders may present a logistical problem as floor brokers must, in exercising due diligence,
shuttle between two trading crowds or, to prevent a trade from occurring while the floor broker is in the second crowd,
utilize two floor brokers to execute such an order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement in proposed Phlx Rule 1033(i) that each leg of an inter-currency spread be executed at or within the
market for the individual leg, and that at least one leg is executed at a price which improves the established market,
should, according to the Exchange, protect investors and the public interest as well as prevent manipulative acts
and practices. The Exchange states that this requirement is also consistent with Phlx Rule 118 which provides that
when a bid/offer is clearly established, no bid/offer outside that price shall be established. The Exchange further
believes that spread priority for inter-currency spreads should facilitate a more simplified execution procedure
for such orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and with Section
6(b)(5),
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 25, 1994, the Commission approved the Exchange's proposal to provide new options specialists units (``New
Units'') trading newly-listed equity options classes with an enhanced participation in parity equity option transactions
(``New Specialist Split'').
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On August 26, 1994, the Commission approved, as a one-year pilot program, the Exchange's proposal to provide an enhanced
parity split in certain assigned equity options classes for option specialists not qualifying for the New Specialist
Split.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In each of those filings, the Phlx indicated that the enhanced parity splits would be applicable to equity options
specialists, however, the Phlx represents that the intent of the Exchange in proposing those rules was to limit the
proposals to options traded on the Phlx's Equity Option Floor, which would specifically include index options but
exclude foreign currency options. The Exchange represents that index options are traded on the Equity Options Floor
and that index option specialists are not separate and distinct from equity options specialists trading at the Exchange.
Accordingly, the Phlx hereby proposes to amend Phlx Rule 1014(g) and Commentary .17 thereunder in order to expand
the enhanced parity split proposals discussed above to expressly include transactions in index options traded on
the Exchange's Equity Options Floor. Because the Exchange represents that this was the original intent of the proposals
discussed above, the Exchange does not expect any new objections to be raised by amending its rules to extend the enhanced
parity split to trades in index options.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission finds that the Phlx proposal to expand its rules regarding enhanced parity splits for
specialists to include index options, in addition to equity options, does not create any regulatory concerns that
were not adequately addressed by the Phlx when the Commission approved the enhanced parity splits available to specialists
trading equity options.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Index options trade on the Exchange's Equity Options Floor and are subject to trading rules substantially similar
to those applicable to equity options. Accordingly, the Commission believes that there is no regulatory reason to
distinguish between equity and index options with regard the availability of an enhanced participation for specialists
in parity option transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 in order to provide specialists trading index options with the same benefits available to specialists trading equity
options. Additionally, because one of the enhanced parity split proposals was approved as a one-year pilot program,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission believes it is appropriate to accelerate approval of the proposed rule change to provide the Exchange
with as much time as possible in order to gather data on the effect and utility of the pilot program prior to its expiration.
Accordingly, the commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the
proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change adopts Floor Procedure Advice F&hyph;24, AUTO-X Contra-Party Participation (The Wheel),
which establishes an automated mechanism for assigning floor traders (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 specialists and Registered Option Traders (``ROTs'')), on a rotating basis, as contra-side participants to AUTO-X
orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AUTO-X system is the automatic execution feature of the Exchange's Automated Options Market (``AUTOM'') system.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 AUTO-X provides customers with automatic executions of eligible option orders at displayed markets.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, floor trader contraside participation defaults to the account of the specialist, and the addition of
ROTs or orders from the trading crowd or the specialist's limit order book as contra-side participants to AUTO-X orders
requires manual keypunch entries.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Wheel automatically includes eligible ROTs in AUTO-X executions and specifies how such trades will be split among
the specialist and ROTs. Customer orders, both on the limit order book and in the trading crowd, will continue to receive
priority in accordance with PHLX rules. An ROT, whether on the Wheel or not, also may have priority.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 If priority is established for the limit order book, a member of the trading crowd, or an ROT, the specialist will stop
the Wheel's operation and manually assign the trade to the contra-party with priority.

AUTOM is an on-line system that allows electronic delivery of options orders from member firms directly to the appropriate
specialist on the Phlx options trading floor, with electronic confirmation of order executions. On March 31, 1988,
the Commission first approved the Phlx's operation of the AUTOM system on a pilot basis. Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 25540 (March 31, 1988), 53 FR 11390.

Public customer orders up to 25 contracts are eligible for AUTO-X. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32906 (September
15, 1993), 58 FR 49345. Orders eligible for automatic execution are (1) printed in hard copy form at the floor representative
booth of the delivering member organization; (2) displayed on the trading crowd screen with buy/sell information
omitted; and (3) printed in hard copy form at the specialist post.

Under the previous method, ROTs were eligible for participation when they had established priority or parity at the
execution price. Under the proposal, an ROT at parity may only be assigned trades through the Wheel.

An ROT may have price priority (if the best bid or offer is the ROT's alone) or time priority (the ROT's bid or offer was
clearly established first at that price).

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The specialist and any signed on ROTs will be listed on the Wheel.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 ROTs must sign on to the Wheel in person on the trading floor from terminals designated by the Exchange. ROTs may sign
on before 9:30 a.m. for the entire trading day or before 12:30 p.m. for trading after 12:30 p.m. An ROT may not sign on
after 12:30 p.m. for the first time that trading day.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Specialists must participate on the Wheel. ROTs may participate on the Wheel in assigned issues. ROTs are limited
to participating in one Wheel assignment area (two contiguous quarter turrets) at any given time. ROTs must be present
in the Wheel assignment area to participate in Wheel executions, although brief, reasonable absences will be permitted.
ROTs must be actively making markets in assigned options. ROTs may sign on in individual options. No two associated
or dually affiliated ROTs may be on the Wheel for the same option at the same time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contra-side participation of AUTO-X orders are assigned to Wheel participants in circular rotation. The specialist
receives the first assignment of trades for the day in each respective option. Thereafter, the Wheel assigns trades
to ROTs in an order standardized for that day on a random basis.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 If there are five or more ROTs signed onto the Wheel, the specialist participates in the first trade of the day and every
fifth assignment thereafter. Each ten lot or order (whichever is smaller) constitutes an assignment. For AUTO-X
orders greater than ten contracts, each ten lot or remaining portion of the order constitutes an assignment. The procedure
for rotating trades among participants will be reviewed by the Exchange's Option Committee after six months.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The first ROT is selected randomly from all ROTs that sign on prior to 9:30 a.m. All other ROTs are prioritized for receipt
of orders based on the badge numbers following sequentially the first ROT's badge number. If other ROTs sign on for
the 12:30 p.m. session, the priority list is re-randomized for that session.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ROT may sign off the Wheel at any time during the trading day, which becomes effective for all listed options. An ROT
may sign off twice each trading day and still be eligible to sign on again that day; after the third sign off, that ROT
is no longer eligible for the Wheel that day. ROTs who sign on for the half-day session beginning at 12:30 p.m. may only
sign off once and still be eligible to sign on again that day. A floor official may modify the sign on/sign off procedures
in extraordinary circumstances.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6 and the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 6(b)(5) of the Act provides that the rules of the exchange must
promote just and equitable principles of trade and remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market, and in general to protect investors and the public interest.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will help the PHLX to provide an orderly market and to encourage small investor participation in the options
markets by facilitating the use of AUTO&hyph;X. AUTO&hyph;X enhances the Exchange's ability to execute small public
customer orders in a timely, accurate, and efficient manner. The manual assignment of contra-participation increases
the time needed to execute each trade through AUTO&hyph;X. During periods of heavy trading volume, this manual operation
may severely restrict AUTO&hyph;X's utility. Therefore, the automation of assignments of contra-parties for AUTO&hyph;X
trades should improve order processing and turnaround time. By not manually entering contra-participant information
for each trade, the Wheel should reduce opportunities for keypunching errors. In addition, the Wheel should generally
reduce the number of contra-participants for each trade.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The reduction in the number of contra-parties to each contract may increase the efficiency of order processing. By
enhancing AUTO&hyph;X's utility, the proposal should assist in providing a free and open market.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the specialist and all ROTs with parity or priority at the execution price would be contra-participants
to an AUTO&hyph;X trade. Under the Wheel, the maximum number of contra-participants would be three. (The maximum
permissible size for AUTO&hyph;X orders is twenty-five contracts, which would be split into two ten-contract assignments
and one five-contract assignment.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the
date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 provides minor amendments to the procedure consistent
with the original proposal. Amendment No. 2 merely clarifies the interaction between the Wheel and the trading crowd
and limit order book. The Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the
full statutory period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendments No. 1 and No. 2
to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary,
Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all
subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission,
and all written communications relating to Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 between the Commission and any persons, other
than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &sect;522, will be available
for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20549. Copies of such filing also will be available at the principal office of PHLX. All submissions should refer to
file No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;94&hyph;32 and should be submitted by December 28, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A new statutory definition of public aircraft was signed into law on October 25, 1994. All persons whose operations
are affected by the change in the statutory definition of public aircraft are advised that they must take steps to ensure
that their operations meet all applicable safety regulations by April 23, 1995, the date the new law becomes effective,
unless by that date they obtain an exemption as provided for by the law. An application for exemption will not stay the
effective date of the statute. The following is a notice from the Administrator advising all persons whose operations
may be affected by the change in the statutory definition of public aircraft.

Appendix_Notice to all Persons Whose Operations may be Affected by the Change in the Statutory Definition of Public
Aircraft
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1994, Congress passed the Independent Safety Board Act Amendments, which contained a major change in
the definition of ``public aircraft.'' Under the previous statutory definition, pubic aircraft were exempt from
many types of FAA regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the new statute, many of those aircraft will not be subject to FAA safety regulations. For example, when the law
becomes effective, aircraft used to transport passengers will, in some circumstances, no longer be considered public
aircraft. Therefore, the operators of such aircraft will need to meet civil aircraft requirements for certification,
maintenance, training, etc., unless they qualify for narrowly described exemptions. Aircraft operated by the Armed
Forces and intelligence agencies, however, will retain their public aircraft status unless operated for a commercial
purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new law will become effective on April 23, 1995. Attached for your information is a copy of the new law. If you intend
to use your aircraft in operations that will no longer be consistent with public aircraft status, then you should start
taking steps now to ensure that your operations meet all applicable safety regulations by the time the new law goes
into effect, or to request an exemption as described in the new law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the FAA Administrator has certain authority to grant exemptions from the civil aircraft safety regulations
to ``units of government,'' the agency expects to invoke its exemption authority only when the public interest clearly
demands it. To obtain an exemption under the statute, a unit of government must show that granting the exemption is
necessary ``to prevent an undue economic burden on the unit of government,'' and that the aviation safety program
of the unit of government is ``effective and appropriate to ensure safe operations of the type of aircraft operated
by the unit of government.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earlier this year, the FAA announced that it would reconsider whether public aircraft status is lost when one government
reimburses another for the use of its aircraft. The FAA invited comments from interested parties. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
59 FR 39192 (August 1, 1994). With Congress' passage of the new law, however, this point has been clarified. Now, if
there is such reimbursement, the aircraft will be civil aircraft unless the appropriate unit of government certifies
``that the operation was necessary to respond to a significant and imminent threat to life or property,'' and ``that
no service by a private operator was reasonably available to meet the threat.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you have questions about how the new law might affect your operations, you may contact Dave Catey, AFS&hyph;220,
(202) 267&hyph;8094. We would appreciate any assistance you can provide in getting this information to other persons
or organizations that may be affected by the change of law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This NOFA provides EDI grant funds to support those communities that submitted applications on behalf of areas that
qualify for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone and that have remaining authority to utilize Section 108 funds
of at least $40 million, or in the case of an urban Empowerment Zone application from joint entities, that have aggregate
Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities that submitted the Empowerment Zone application of at least $40
million. In the case of a joint Empowerment Zone application from two or more entities, HUD will accept a joint EDI application
from public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance pursuant to &sect;570.702. However, each of
the joint applicants will be expected to execute separate EDI grant agreements and separate loan commitments and
issuance documents for their related Section 108 loan guarantees. EDI grant awards will not be made to designated
urban Empowerment Zone entities designated under that competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EDI is intended to complement and enhance the Section 108 Loan Guarantee program (see 24 CFR 570.700&hyph;710 for
regulations governing the Section 108 program). This provision of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG)
program provides communities with a source of financing for economic development, housing rehabilitation, and
large scale physical development projects. HUD is authorized pursuant to Section 108 to guarantee notes issued by
CDBG entitlement communities and nonentitlement units of general local government eligible to receive funds under
their State CDBG program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations governing the Section 108 program are found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. EDI grants shall also be subject
to the rules found at 24 CFR part 570, subpart M. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, assistance provided under this NOFA is subject to the requirements of section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968, and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135, as amended by an interim rule published
on June 30, 1994 (59 FR 33866). Section 3 requires that to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with Federal,
State, and local laws and regulations, job training, employment and other contracting opportunities generated
from certain HUD financial assistance be directed to low- and very-low income persons. The eligible activities for
which funding is provided under this NOFA are consistent with the objectives of section 3. Public entities awarded
funds under this NOFA and that intend to use the funds for housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other
public construction must comply with the applicable requirements of the interim regulations published on June 30,
1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Section 108 program is authorized at $2.054 billion in loan guarantee authority in Fiscal Year 1995. Under the
Section 108 program, units of general local government and States, if applicable, pledge future years' CDBG allocations
as security for loans guaranteed by HUD. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all
guarantees made under Section 108. In the event that a Section 108 funded activity fails to generate sufficient funds
to repay the Section 108 loan and there are insufficient EDI grant funds or other assets available to be used to make
the payment, a community would be required to use its CDBG funds to make the loan payment. Without the availability
of an EDI grant, this potential disruption in availability of CDBG funds for program activities has made many communities
reluctant to utilize the Section 108 loan program. EDI minimizes the potential loss of future CDBG allocations by
either providing a loan loss reserve (for use in making Section 108 guaranteed loan payments if needed), lowering
the cost of borrowing under Section 108 (making full or partial interest payments), or providing other credit and
economic enhancements that reduce the risk that the pledged annual CDBG allocation would be required to fund repayment
shortfalls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because economic development projects carried out in, or serving, the most economically and physically distressed
neighborhoods, such as those found in areas qualifying for urban Empowerment Zone designation, face the greatest
risk of loss of Section 108 loan funds, HUD intends to provide a maximum ratio of EDI grant funds to Section 108 loan funds
of one-to-one. An EDI grant can reduce the risk to future CDBG funds:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) By strengthening the economic feasibility of the projects financed with Section 108 funds (and thereby increasing
the probability that the project will generate enough cash to repay the guaranteed loan); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) By enabling a speedy repayment of the Section 108 loan guarantee notes; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Through a combination of these risk mitigation techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD envisions that the following project structures could be typical: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funding reserves_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cash flow generated by an economic development project may be expected to be relatively ``thin'' in the early stages
of the project. The EDI grant can make it possible for debt service or operating reserves to be established in a way that
does not jeopardize the economic feasibility of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example is a supermarket or neighborhood shopping center that is designed to provide basic services and jobs for
residents in the distressed neighborhood. The public entity must be prepared for the Section 108 loan repayments
required during the time period after completion of construction and during the lease-up phase when the shopping
center is not fully leased and generating sufficient revenues to support the Section 108 loan repayments. It may therefore
require the developer to establish with a trustee a reserve account (or accounts) that would be available to cover
operating expenses and/or debt service during this lease-up period. While such reserves are commonplace, their
cost may be so high as to make an already risky neighborhood shopping center project economically infeasible. The
increased cost resulting from establishing such reserves may be defrayed by the EDI grant. As with the letter of credit
example below, such reserves protect the CDBG program against the risk that CDBG funds will have to be used to cover
shortfalls in the intended source for repayment of the Section 108 loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Over-collateralizing the Section 108 loan_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of EDI grant funds may be structured in appropriate cases so as to improve the chances that cash flow will be sufficient
to cover debt service on the Section 108 loan and directly enhance the guaranteed loan. One technique for accomplishing
this approach is over-collateralization of the Section 108 loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example is the creation of a loan pool made up of equal amounts of Section 108 and EDI grant funds. The community would
make loans to various businesses at an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate on the Section 108 loan. The total
loan portfolio would be pledged to the repayment of the Section 108 loan. If the total loan repayments from the loan
fund were twice the amount of the debt service on the Section 108 loan, the community could accumulate a loan loss reserve
that would mitigate virtually any risk to future CDBG funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct enhancement of the security of the Section 108 loan
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The EDI grant can be used to cover the cost of providing enhanced security. An example of how the EDI grant can be used
for this purpose is by using the grant funds to cover the cost of a standby letter of credit, issued in favor of HUD. This
letter of credit will be available to fund amounts due on the Section 108 loan if other sources fail to materialize and
will, thus, serve to protect the public entity's future CDBG funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provision of financing to for-profit businesses at a below market interest rate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_While the rates on loans guaranteed under Section 108 are only slightly above the rates on comparable U.S. Treasury
obligations, they may nonetheless be higher than can be afforded by businesses in severely, economically distressed
neighborhoods. The EDI grant can be used to make Section 108 financing affordable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a community's strategic plan to stabilize the economic viability of a severely distressed neighborhood
may provide financial loan assistance to both new and existing businesses at very low interest rates for some period
of time until each business has reached a stabilized and profitable level of operation. EDI grant funds would serve
to ``buy down'' the interest rate up front, or make full or partial interest payments, allowing the businesses to be
financially viable in the early start-up period not otherwise possible with Section 108 alone.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EDI applications will be evaluated concurrently with request(s) or application(s) for Section 108 guarantee commitments
or request(s) or application(s) for approval of amendments to previously approved Section 108 applications that
will be enhanced by the EDI assistance. (See II.B. of this NOFA.) HUD notification to the grantee of the amount and conditions
(if any) of EDI funds awarded based upon review of the EDI application shall constitute an obligation of grant funds,
subject to compliance with the conditions of award and execution of a grant agreement.

(E) Limitations on Grant Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD expects to approve EDI grant amounts of up to $100 million each with the ratio of EDI to Section 108 funds of 1:1. Applicants
cannot request grants exceeding a one-to-one ratio of EDI funds to Section 108 funds. In the case of requested amendments
to an approved Section 108 loan guarantee commitment, the EDI assistance approved will be based on the increased amount
of Section 108 loan guarantee assistance. HUD reserves the right to determine a minimum and a maximum amount of any
EDI award per application or project and to modify requests accordingly. The applicant will be required to modify
its project plans and application to conform to the terms of HUD approval (final obligation) before execution of a
grant agreement. HUD reserves the right to reduce or de-obligate the EDI award if approvable Section 108 loan guarantee
applications are not submitted by the grantee in the required amounts on a timely basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Generally, eligible applicants for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EDI grants under section 108(q) of the Act are those public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance
pursuant to &sect;570.702. However, this NOFA further limits eligible applicants to those communities that submitted
applications on behalf of areas that qualify for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone, and that have remaining
Section 108 loan guarantee authority of at least $40 million; or in the case of an urban Empowerment Zone application
from joint entities, an aggregate Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities that submitted the Empowerment
Zone application of at least $40 million. In the case of a joint Empowerment Zone application for two or more entities,
HUD will accept a joint EDI application from the same public entities eligible to apply for loan guarantee assistance
pursuant to &sect;570.702. However, each of the joint applications will be expected to execute separate EDI grant
agreements and separate loan commitments and issuance documents for their related section 108 loan guarantees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The EDI application (an original and two copies) shall be accompanied by a request for loan guarantee assistance
under Section 108. The request for Section 108 loan guarantee can be either one or more of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A formal application for Section 108 loan guarantee(s), including the documents listed at &sect;570.704(b);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A brief description of a Section 108 loan guarantee application(s) to be submitted within 60 days (with HUD reserving
the right to extend such period for good cause, generally, on a case-by-case basis) of a notice of EDI selection (EDI
awards will be conditioned on approval of actual Section 108 loan commitments). This description must be sufficient
to support the basic eligibility of the proposed project or activities for Section 108 assistance;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) If applicable, a copy of a Section 108 loan guarantee approval document with grant number and date of approval (which
was approved 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
after
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the date of this NOFA, except in conjunction with a previous EDI award); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A request for a Section 108 loan guarantee amendment (analogous to subparagraph (a) or (b) above) that proposes
to increase the amount of a previously approved application. However, any amount of Section 108 loan guarantee authority
approved 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
before
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the date of this NOFA is not eligible to be used in conjunction with an EDI grant under this NOFA. Further, a Section 108
loan guarantee application that is the subject of a prior EDI grant award, whether or not the Section 108 loan guarantee
has been approved as of the date of this NOFA, is not eligible for an EDI award under this NOFA. For example, if a community
has a previously approved Section 108 loan guarantee of $12 million, even if none of the funds have been utilized, or
if the community had previously been awarded an EDI grant of $1 million and had certified that it will submit a Section
108 loan application for $10 million in support of that EDI grant, the community's application under this NOFA must
propose to increase the amount of its total Section 108 loan guarantee commitments beyond those amounts (the $12 million
or $10 million in this example) it has previously committed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition, for EDI grant assistance, the public entity/entities shall submit the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) SF 424, Application for Federal Assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The certification regarding lobbying required under 24 CFR part 87 (Appendix A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A brief narrative statement describing the activities that will be carried out with the EDI grant funds and explaining
how the use of EDI grant funds meets the selection criteria in paragraph II.(C) below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The application shall be deemed to include a copy of the strategic plan for community revitalization previously
submitted to HUD as part of a Federal Empowerment Zone application pursuant to a Notice inviting applications, published
on January 18, 1994 at 59 FR 2711. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) Award Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be considered for awards under this NOFA based upon the following criteria that demonstrate
the quality of the proposed project, and the applicant's capacity and commitment to use EDI funds, in accordance with
the purposes of EDI. HUD reserves the right to determine a minimum and maximum amount of any EDI award per application
or project and to modify requests accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Threshold

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Quality of the Section 108/EDI plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD must determine that the applicant's proposed plan for the EDI grant/Section 108 loan guarantee project(s) or
activities will address economic needs in the applicant's qualifying Empowerment Zone area, and the plan for such
project(s) or activities is logically, feasibly, and substantially likely to achieve its stated purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The capacity or potential of the public entity to successfully carry out the Section 108/EDI plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD must determine that the public entity's performance in the administration of its CDBG program; its previous experience,
if any, in administering a section 108 loan guarantee; its performance and capacity in carrying out economic development
projects; its ability to conduct prudent underwriting; and its capacity to manage and service loans made with the
guaranteed loan funds or EDI grant funds demonstrate that it is substantially likely to carry out the approved projects
or activities in a satisfactory manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Distress.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD must determine that the level of distress in the immediate community to be served and/or the jurisdiction applying
for assistance meets the test of general distress set forth in 24 CFR 597.102 (see January 18, 1994 interim rule, at
59 FR 2704&hyph;2705). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extent of need for assistance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD must determine that there is a lack of financial resources to carry out the project without EDI assistance. In making
this determination, HUD will consider: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Projects costs and financial requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount of any debt service or operating reserve accounts to be established in connection with the economic
development project; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The reasonableness of the costs of any credit enhancement paid with EDI grant funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The amount of program income (if any) to be received each year during the repayment period for the guaranteed loan;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Interest rates on those loans to third parties (other than subrecipients) (either as an absolute rate or as a plus/minus
spread to the Section 108 rate); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Underwriting guidelines used (or expected to be used) in determining project feasibility; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

_The Secretary has determined that the following additional factors are appropriate to this NOFA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The applicant submitted an application for urban Empowerment Zone designation pursuant to the Notice inviting
Empowerment Zone applications published January 18, 1994 at 59 FR 2711 (see also paragraph (d) below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The applicant has remaining Section 108 loan guarantee authority of at least $40 million or in the case of an urban
Empowerment Zone application from joint entities an aggregate Section 108 loan authority for all of the entities
that submitted the Empowerment Zone application of at least $40 million;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Timing of grant awards_HUD will, consistent with the approvability of the Section 108 guarantee applications
submitted, strive to obligate EDI grants contemporaneously with HUD approval of the related Section 108 loan guarantee
commitment. However, the EDI grant may be awarded prior to HUD approval of the Section 108 commitment, if approvable
Section 108 guarantee applications have not been submitted by the applicant at the time of EDI awards. In addition,
EDI funds shall not be disbursed to the public entity before the issuance of the related Section 108 guaranteed obligations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Activities proposed and approved to be carried out with EDI funds under this NOFA must be located in or serve an area
qualifying for designation as an urban Empowerment Zone under the notice inviting applications, published on January
18, 1994 at 59 FR 2711. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 am and 5:30 pm weekdays
at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410.

, has determined that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions,
or on their relationship with the Federal Government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between
them and other levels of government. While the NOFA offers financial assistance to units of general local government,
none of its provisions will have an effect on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or the
States' political subdivisions.

The Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, has determined that the policies announced in this NOFA would not have the potential for significant impact on family
formation, maintenance and general well-being within the meaning of the Order. No significant change in existing
HUD policies and programs will result from issuance of this NOFA, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. HUD's regulation implementing section
13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the Department in these ways, they
are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule
contains examples of activities covered by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD Office.
