SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule establishes requirements for red variety onions grown in South Texas under Marketing Order 959. In
recent years, shipments of poor quality red onions have appeared in the marketplace and have adversely affected grower
prices. This rule will tend to improve grower prices by providing more desirable quality red onions for consumers.
This rule also extends the termination date of the order's regulatory period from May 20 to June 15 of each year. More
late season onions are being grown in a portion of the production area, increasing the need for marketing order quality
requirements over a longer time period. Regulating onions from the production area through June 15 will help make
more desirable onions available to markets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement No. 143 and Marketing Order No. 959 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7 CFR Part 959), as amended, regulating the handling of onions grown in South Texas, hereinafter referred to as the
``order.'' This order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C 601&hyph;674),
hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 38 handlers of South Texas onions who are subject to regulation under the marketing order and 97 producers
in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers, have been defined by the Small
Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural
producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of South Texas onions may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its November 9, 1993, meeting, the South Texas Onion Committee (committee) recommended, under the authority of
&sect;959.52(c) of the order, that red varieties of onions be regulated and also that the termination date of the regulatory
period for all varieties of regulated onions be extended from May 20 to June 15 of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Red varieties of onions have been exempt from regulation since the inception of Marketing Order No. 959. The quantities
of such onions produced have usually represented a small portion of the total annual production in the marketing order's
regulated area. However, red variety acreage has increased significantly in recent seasons. Moreover, the committee
reports that poor quality red onions grown in the production area have appeared in the marketplace from time to time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact on the industry is two-fold. Poor quality red onions diminish consumer confidence in the better quality
red onions, leading to fewer sales and lower returns to growers. In addition, a less favorable consumer opinion of
red variety onions often leads to lower sales for all onions grown in the production area, including yellow and white
varieties which now enjoy an excellent reputation with receivers and consumers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Red onions, like yellow onions and white onions, are varieties of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allium cepa
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and are therefore covered by the same U.S. standards referenced in &sect;959.322(h). Because of this, the regulatory
requirements set forth in &sect;959.322 applicable to yellow and white varieties of onions are appropriate for red
varieties also. The committee believes that by regulating red onions in the same fashion as yellow and white onions,
consumers can be assured of buying better quality red onions. Thus, increased consumer confidence should result
in improved returns to growers. In addition to grade and size requirements, the committee also recommended that red
varieties be subject to the same pack, container, inspection, assessment, and safeguard requirements as yellow
and white varieties. In this way, red, yellow, and white onions will be regulated to the same extent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second recommendation concerns the length of the regulatory period for shipments of onions from the regulated
area. Previously, order regulations were in effect from March 1 through May 20 each year. District 2 (Laredo-Winter
Garden) is in the northern part of the production area and has a shipping season that extends from May to well into June.
This district is comprised of the Counties of Zapata, Webb, Jim Hogg, DeWitt, Wilson, Atascosa, Karnes, Val Verde,
Frio, Kinney, Uvalde, Medina, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit and LaSalle. In the 1980's, District 2 production was declining
and industry members asked to be relieved from the marketing order requirements after May 20 each season, instead
of the June 15 date in effect at that time. By May 20, shipments from District No. 1 in the southern part of the production
area usually are finished. Thus, effective for the 1989 and subsequent seasons, the termination date for the regulatory
period was advanced for the entire production area from June 15 to May 20 (54 FR 8519, March 1, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, committee records indicate an increase in onion shipments from District 2 during the past three years. The
committee members from District 2 who attended the November meeting stated that shipments during the May 20 through
June 15 period should once again be regulated so that funds could be assessed to fund the committee's production research
and market development efforts as well as assure the consumer a quality pack of onions from their district. Shipments
from this district typically account for 10 to 12 percent of the production area total, and the committee believes
that grade, size, container, and other order requirements are necessary to maintain the quality of South Texas onions
that receivers and consumers have become accustomed to. Extension of the regulatory period will not affect District
1 handlers as shipments from that district normally are completed by mid-May. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, handlers may not package or load onions on Sunday during the period March 1 through May 20 of each season.
The committee recommended not changing this requirement. After May 20, District 2 handlers compete with unregulated
shipments from other areas such as California. Permitting District 2 handlers to package and ship whenever they can
find buyers will help to reduce the competitive advantage of handlers shipping from outside the regulated area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of this final rule was published in the March 9, 1994, issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 11008). Interested persons were invited to file written comments with respect to the proposal until March 24,
1994. Ten comments were received. One was from Mr. Greg Nelson, of the Cargil Produce Company, Uvalde, Texas, which
is located in District 2. Mr. Nelson opposed the extension of the regulatory period. He stated that non-regulated
areas such as California, the Vidalia area of Georgia, New Mexico, Arizona, and the Trans-Pecos area of Texas ship
large quantities of new crop onions. These onions compete with regulated onions from District 2 (Laredo-Winter Garden).
Mr. Nelson stated that the other shipping areas, being unregulated, have a significant competitive advantage over
District 2 growers and handlers because those onions do not have to meet grade requirements and the handlers do not
have to pay inspection costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six other comments also opposed the proposed extension of the regulation period. These comments were received from
Mr. Kenneth Spence, Mr. Robert Willoughby, and Mr. Lee Toombs, all of Batesville; and from Mr. C.W. Cargil, Mr. Steve
Cargil, and Mr. Steve Rambie, from Uvalde, Texas. All stated that regulating District 2 onions after May 20 would cause
a hardship on District 2 growers by giving non-regulated producing areas a competitive advantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the November 9, 1993, meeting during which this change in regulatory period was recommended, 11 members were present;
the full committee is composed of 17 members. The committee unanimously recommended this action, including two members
from District 2. For District 1, one position was not represented by either a member or alternate; for District 2, two
members out of seven were in attendance. None of the opponents were in attendance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although District 2 producers and handlers usually face competition from non-regulated areas during much of their
shipping season, it is important that handling requirements apply to shipments from that district to protect the
good quality image enjoyed by South Texas onions in the marketplace and promoted by the committee's market development
program. In the absence of quality and inspection requirements, low quality onions from District 2 could be shipped.
Such shipments could negatively effect the South Texas industry's market development efforts and quality image.
Also, in the interest of equity and uniform regulation application, it is desirable that handlers from District 2
pay assessments in support of these activities. Assessments paid have helped to provide an on-going production research
program that has benefitted the entire industry with the development of new onion varieties and new cultural techniques,
as well as an effective market development program that helps increase sales. Therefore, these comments are denied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three remaining comments were from the South Texas Onion committee, Mr. John R. Bearden, and Mr. B. L. Lackey. These
comments stated that if the rule is not adopted by April 1, the anticipated beginning of the red onion harvesting and
shipping season, poor quality red onions will be dumped on the market, thereby diminishing consumer confidence and
depressing the market for South Texas onions. After evaluating the comments, the Department has decided to implement
the committee's recommendation as proposed, and make the final rule effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality or maturity requirements are in effect for onions
under a domestic marketing order, imported onions must meet the same or comparable requirements, subject to concurrence
by the United States Trade Representative. Because this rule establishes grade, size, quality and maturity requirements
on red onions and changes the regulatory period under the South Texas onion marketing order, corresponding changes
are needed in the onion import regulation. Such changes have been addressed in a separate onion import rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB number
0581&hyph;0074. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the proposal submitted by the committee, comments
received, and other information, it is hereby found that this regulation, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this
section until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because (1) the shipping season for onions has already begun and for maximum effectiveness this rule should apply
to as many shipments as possible; (2) the proposed rule was discussed at an open public meeting, and all interested
persons had an opportunity to voice concerns; and (3) there are no special preparations required of the handler that
cannot be completed by the effective date.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 10, 1992, the Commission sent to Congress new rules on special fundraising projects and other uses of candidate
names by unauthorized committees. The rules prohibit the use of a candidate's name in the title of any fundraising
project or other communication by any committee that has not been authorized by the named candidate. 11 CFR 102.14(a).
The rules became effective on November 4, 1992. 57 FR 47258 (Oct. 15, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules construe 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(4), a provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act [``FECA'' or ``the Act'']
that prohibits the use of a candidate's name in the name of an unauthorized political committee. Prior to the 1992 revision,
the Commission had construed this prohibition as applying only to the name under which a committee registers with
the Commission [the ``registered name''].

On February 5, 1993, the Commission received a Petition for Rulemaking from Citizens Against David Duke [``CADD''],
a proposed project of the American Ideas Foundation. The petition requested that the Commission reconsider and repeal
the new rules, with particular emphasis on those titles that indicate opposition to, rather than support for, a named
candidate.

In response to these comments, the Commission published an NPRM proposing that the rule be amended so as to permit the
use of candidate names in titles that clearly indicate opposition to the named candidate. 58 FR 65559 (Dec. 15, 1993).
The Commission received four comments in response to this Notice, three of which reflected in whole or in part comments
submitted earlier in the course of the rulemaking.

842 F.2d 436 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Commission's
authority to interpret the prohibition at 2 U.S.C. 432(e)(4) on the use of a candidate's name in the name of an unauthorized
committee as applying only to the name under which the committee registered with the Commission, since ``[an] agency's
construction, if reasonable, must ordinarily be honored.''

at 439&hyph;40. However, the court recognized that an interpretation imposing a more extensive ban on the use of candidate
names by unauthorized committees, such as prohibiting their use in the titles of any fundraising projects sponsored
by an unauthorized committee, ``could also be accommodated within the provision's literal language.''

Some commenters on both the 1992 and the current NPRM noted that this rulemaking implicates protected first amendment
rights, and that any infringement on these rights is subject to strict scrutiny by reviewing courts. However, it is
well established that first amendment rights are not absolute when balanced against the government's interest in
protecting the integrity of the electoral process. ``Even a `significant interference' with protected rights [&blank;]
may be sustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and employs means closely drawn to avoid
unnecessary abridgment'' of those rights.

The

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision grew out of the 1980 presidential election. Since that time, the Commission has become increasingly concerned
over the possibility for confusion or abuse under the interpretation upheld in that case, that is, limiting the FECA's
``name'' prohibition to a committee's registered name. Aware of these constitutional concerns, the 1992 NPRM sought
comments on two modifications to the rules then in effect that fell short of an overall ban.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the first proposal, the political committee sponsoring the project would have been required to include in the
required disclaimer the name of the committee paying for the project, as well as a statement whether the project had
been authorized by the candidate whose name appeared in the title, or by any other candidate. As part of this proposal,
the Commission also sought comments on whether disclaimer size and/or location requirements should be imposed in
this situation. Second, a committee would not have been allowed to accept checks received in response to a special
project solicitation, unless the checks were made payable to the registered name of the committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Commission also sought comments on a proposed total bar on the use of a candidate's name in the project
title of an unauthorized committee's special fundraising project; and several commenters endorsed this approach.
After considering all comments received in response to that Notice, the Commission decided that the total ban was
justified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains substantial evidence that potential contributors often confuse an unauthorized
committee's registered name with the names of its fundraising projects, and wrongly believe that their contributions
will be used in support of the candidate(s) named in the project titles. Although one commenter on the present rulemaking
stated that the Commission had overstated the potential for fraud and abuse in this area, no comment provided information
to refute this earlier determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is narrowly designed to further the legitimate governmental interest in minimizing the possibility of
fraud and abuse in this situation. Committees are not barred from establishing specially designated projects: They
are free to choose whatever project title they desire, as long as it does not include the name of a federal candidate.
Also, committees may freely discuss any number of candidates, by name, in the body of a communication. The newly-revised
rule further enhances unauthorized committees' constitutional rights by exempting from the ban those titles that
clearly indicate opposition to the named candidate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear from the rulemaking record that the situation today differs significantly from that of the early 1980's,
when the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Common Cause
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case was litigated. Prior to the adoption of the 1992 rules, the use of candidate names in the titles of projects or other
unauthorized communications had increasingly become a device for unauthorized committees to raise funds or disseminate
information. Under the former interpretation, a candidate who objected to the use of his or her name in this manner,
who shared in none of the funds received in response to the solicitation, and/or who disagreed with the views expressed
in the communication, was largely powerless to stop it. For example, in 1984 a United States Senator requested, and
received, permission to obtain from Commission records the names and addresses of those who had responded to unauthorized
solicitations made in his name, to inform these contributors that he had not authorized the solicitation. However,
he could not suggest that contributors send donations instead to his campaign committee. See Advisory Opinion 1984&hyph;2.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An examination of the record in the 1992 rulemaking, which contains information that was not available when that NPRM
was put out for comment, further supports the Commission's conclusion that this balance has now shifted so as to justify
a broader interpretation. For example, a comment from an authorized committee of a major party presidential candidate
stated that an unauthorized project using that candidate's name raised over $10,000,000 during the 1988 presidential
election cycle, despite the candidate's disavowal of and efforts to stop these activities. The same unauthorized
committee was raising money by means of a comparable project, using that same candidate's name, in the 1992 election
cycle. This comment added that two other unauthorized projects by that same committee raised over $4,000,000 and
nearly $400,000 in the name of two other presidential candidates in the 1988 election cycle. None of the named candidates
received any of the money that was collected in their names. One of these candidates, a United States Senator, also
submitted comments asking that the pertinent rules be strengthened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a television documentary, a videotape of which was placed in the rulemaking record, detailed how an unauthorized
Political Action Committee had, over several election cycles, established numerous projects whose titles included
the names of federal candidates. The named candidates had no connection with the projects, had not authorized the
use of their names in this manner, and received no money from the $9 million raised in response to these appeals. Program
investigators found that elderly people are particularly vulnerable to being misled in this manner, since they may
not notice or fail to fully comprehend the disclaimers included with the solicitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such cases point up the potential for confusion or abuse when an unauthorized committee uses a candidate's name in
the title of a special fundraising project, or other designation under which the committee operates. A person who
receives such a communication may confuse the project name with the committee's registered name, and thus may not
understand that the communication is made on behalf of the unauthorized committee rather than the candidate whose
name appears in the project's title. Potential donors may think they are giving money to the candidate named in the
project's title, when this is not the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments that opposed any modifications to the former standard argued that current disclaimer requirements
at section 441d(a)(3) were sufficient to minimize the potential for confusion in this area. Others suggested stronger,
or larger, disclaimers, in place of the overall ban. One suggested that the disclaimer be in as large and as bold a typeface
as the largest, boldest use of the candidate's name anywhere in the communication. The Commission believes that such
an approach could be more burdensome than the current ban, while still not solving the potential for fraud and abuse
in this area. The requirement that checks be made only to the sponsoring committee's registered name would similarly
not ensure that the contributor did not erroneously believe the money would be used to support the candidate(s) named
in the project's title. It also would be difficult, if not practically impossible, to monitor and enforce, since nothing
on the public record reflects who the payee is on a contributor's check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that the ban applies only to project titles, and not to the body of the accompanying communication.
Unauthorized committees remain free to discuss candidates throughout the communication; and to use candidates'
names as frequently, and highlight them as prominently (in terms of size, typeface, location, and so forth) as they
choose. In other words, while a committee could not establish a fundraising project called ``Citizens for Doe,''
if Doe is a federal candidate, it could use a subheading such as ``Help Us Elect Doe to Federal Office,'' and urge Doe's
election, by name, in large, highlighted type, throughout the communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, by amending the regulation to exclude from the ban names that indicate opposition to the named candidate, the
Commission has acceded to the petitioner's main concern, amending the rules to permit the American Ideas Foundation
to use the names of federal candidates in titles that clearly indicate opposition to such candidates. As stated in
its summary of the petition (petition, p. 1), ``There is no danger of confusion or abuse inherent in the use of a candidate's
name by a committee or project which opposes the candidate.'' The Commission recognizes that the potential for fraud
and abuse is significantly reduced in the case of such titles, and has accordingly revised its rules to permit them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition also asked that the rule exclude from the ban the use of candidate names in titles by those committees ``that
are authorized to use the candidate's name, which are engaged in activities which will not actively mislead the public
or injure the candidate, or which otherwise clearly indicate that they are unauthorized.'' However, if a candidate
authorizes the use of his or her name in a fundraising project, the committee becomes an authorized committee, and
this rule would not apply. The phrase ``engaged in activities which will not actively mislead the public or injure
the candidate'' is vague and would result in the need to determine on a case-by-case basis whether covered communications
met this test. The Commission has already determined that a stronger disclaimer requirement would not be sufficient
in and of itself to meet this concern. Given the wide range of options that committees continue to have regarding use
of candidate names, imposing further requirements could well prove more burdensome than the present approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed that exempted titles would have to ``clearly and unambiguously [show] opposition to the named candidate
by using words such as `defeat' or `oppose.''' The requirement that such specific ``triggering words'' be included
in the title has been deleted from the final rule, since the Commission recognizes that certain titles, such as ``Citizens
Fed Up with Doe,'' may clearly and unambiguously indicate opposition to a candidate even though no individual word
in the title has that import.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter argued that legislative action is necessary to effectuate this change, noting that the Commission
has in the past included this issue in the legislative recommendations it submits to Congress each year. However,
it is well established that courts will not rely on an agency's legislative recommendation to undermine the agency's
construction of a statute as authorizing it to act. The Supreme Court has stated that holding an agency's legislative
recommendation against it is disfavored, because ``[p]ublic policy requires that agencies feel free to ask [Congress
for] legislation,'' and this freedom to act would be chilled if such requests could later be held against them.

The Commission notes that David Duke is not currently a candidate for federal office, so the use of his name in a project
title is not prohibited by these rules. Should he again become a federal candidate, such use of his name would be governed
by these revised rules.

This final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for
this certification is that any small entities affected are already required to comply with the Act's requirements
in this area. Also, the rule broadens the Commission's interpretation of these requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA is finalizing the updates of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 7, 1994 and February 8, 1994. Requirements applying to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward
boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent with the requirements of the corresponding onshore
area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (``the Act''), as amended by the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS Air Regulations that is being updated pertains to the requirements for OCS
sources for which the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (San Luis Obispo County APCD), the Santa
Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa Barbara APCD), the South Coast Air Quality Management District
(South Coast AQMD), and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated
COAs. The intended effect of approving the requirements contained in ``San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control
District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'' (March 11, 1994), ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994 at 59 FR 994 and February 8, 1994 at 59 FR 5745, EPA proposed to approve the following requirements
into the Outer Continental Shelf Air Regulations: ``San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District Requirements
applicable to OCS Sources'', ``Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to
OCS Sources'', ``South Coast Air Quality Management District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources'', and ``Ventura
County Air Pollution Control District Requirements Applicable to OCS Sources''. These requirements represent
the third update of part 55 and are being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules from local air pollution
control agencies. EPA has evaluated the above requirements to ensure that they are rationally related to the attainment
or maintenance of Federal or state ambient air quality standards or part C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed
expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1.
EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure that they are not arbitrary or capricious. 40 CFR 55.12(e). In addition,
EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 30-day public comment period was provided at 59 FR 994 and 59 FR 5745 and no comments were received.

EPA Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this document, EPA takes final action to incorporate the proposed changes into 40 CFR part 55. One minor change was
made to the proposal set forth in the January 7, 1994 and February 8, 1994 notices of proposed rulemaking. This change
includes the addition of a document date for the requirements to be incorporated into part 55. EPA is approving the
submittal as modified under section 328(a)(1) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7627. Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA
establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries
that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable
onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore.

Administrative Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12291 (Regulatory Impact Analysis)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.
This exemption continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September
30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities
include small businesses, organizations, and governmental jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was stated in the final OCS regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the
rule averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements contained in the
final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0249. This consistency update does not add any further requirements.

 The State of Texas has applied for final authorization of a revision to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Texas' application
and decided that its hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for
final authorization. Unless adverse written comments are received during the review and comment period provided
for public participation in this process, EPA intends to approve Texas' hazardous waste program revision, subject
to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. Texas' application
for the program revision is available for public review and comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA or ``the
Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows
States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated
under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive interim authorization for the HSWA requirements

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR 260&hyph;266, 268, 124, and 270.

Texas received final authorization to implement its hazardous waste management program on December 12, 1984, effective
December 26, 1984 (see 49 FR 48300). This authorization was clarified in a notice published in the FR on March 26, 1985
(see 50 FR 11858). Texas received final authorization for revisions to its program in notices published in the FR on
January 31, 1986, effective October 4, 1985 (see 51 FR 3952), on December 18, 1986, effective February 17, 1987 (see
51 FR 45320), on March 1, 1990, effective March 15, 1990 (see 55 FR 7318), on May 24, 1990, effective July 23, 1990 (see
55 FR 21383), on August 22, 1991, effective October 21, 1991 (see 56 FR 41626), and on October 5, 1992, effective December
4, 1992 (see 57 FR 45719). On December 8, 1992, the Texas Water Commission (TWC) submitted a final complete program
revision application for additional program approvals. (In 1991, Texas Senate Bill 2 created the Texas Natural Resources
Conservation Commission (TNRCC) which combined the functions of the former Texas Water Commission and the former
Texas Air Control Board. The transfer of functions to the TNRCC from the two agencies became effective on September
1, 1993. Under Chapter 361 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, the TNRCC has sole responsibility for the administration
of laws and regulations concerning hazardous waste). Today, Texas is seeking approval of its program revision in
accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reviewed Texas' application, and made an immediate final decision that Texas' hazardous waste program revision
satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant
final authorization for the additional program modifications to Texas. The public may submit written comments on
EPA's final decision until May 27, 1994. Copies of Texas' application for program revision are available for inspection
and copying at the locations indicated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approval of Texas' program revision shall become effective 75 days from the date this notice is published, unless
an adverse written comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the
comment period. If an adverse written comment is received, EPA will publish either (1) a withdrawal of the immediate
final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to the comment that either affirms that the immediate final decision
takes effect or reverses the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas' program revision application includes State regulatory changes that are equivalent to the rules promulgated
in the Federal RCRA implementing regulations in 40 CFR Parts 124, 260&hyph;262, 264, 265, and 270 that were published
in the FR through June 30, 1991. This proposed approval includes the provisions that are listed in the chart below.
This chart also lists the State analogs that are being recognized as equivalent to the appropriate Federal requirements.
(As a result of the Texas reorganization presented above, TNRCC rules, once codified at Title 31 Texas Administrative
Code, are now codified at Title 30 Texas Administrative Code).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I conclude that Texas' application for a program revision meets the statutory and regulatory requirements established
by RCRA. Accordingly, Texas is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and
for carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations
of the HSWA. Texas also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections
under Section 3007 of RCRA, and to take enforcement actions under Sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA.

EPA uses 40 CFR 272 for codification of the decision to authorize Texas' program and for incorporation by reference
of those provisions of Texas' statutes and regulations that EPA will enforce under Section 3008, 3013, and 7003 of
RCRA. Therefore, EPA is reserving amendment of 40 CFR 272, Subpart E, until a later date.

Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of Texas' program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers
of hazardous waste in the State. This authorization does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends the gas, hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipeline safety regulations to require that certain
new and replacement pipelines be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection
devices (smart pigs). This action was taken in response to a mandate in the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of
1988. The intended effect of these amended regulations is to improve the safety of gas, hazardous liquid and carbon
dioxide pipelines by permitting their inspection by ``smart pigs'' using the latest technology for detecting and
recording abnormalities in the pipe wall.

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RSPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54745) proposing that new and replacement
gas transmission lines and new and replacement hazardous liquid pipelines and carbon dioxide pipelines be designed
and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. However, the rules would
not apply to specific installations for which such design and construction would be impracticable. In addition,
the NPRM proposed a procedure for operators seeking an administrative ruling on any rule in parts 192, 193 and 195 in
which the administrator is authorized to make a finding or approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM was issued in response to Congressional mandates in sections 108(b) and 207(b) of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization
Act of 1988 (hereinafter ``Reauthorization Act'') (Pub. L. 100&hyph;561; Oct. 31, 1988). Section 108(b) of the Reauthorization
Act amended section 3 of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (NGPSA) by adding subsection (g), ``Instrumented
Internal Inspection Devices'' (49 app. U.S.C. 1672). This new subsection requires the Secretary of Transportation
to establish regulations requiring that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) The design and construction of new [gas] transmission facilities, and (2) when replacement of existing transmission
facilities or equipment is required, the replacement of such existing facilities, be carried out, to the extent practicable,
in a manner so as to accommodate the passage through such transmission facilities of instrumented internal inspection
devices (commonly referred to as ``smart pigs'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 207(b) of the Reauthorization Act amended section 203 of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979
(HLPSA) (49 app. U.S.C. 2002) to require that DOT establish similar regulations with respect to pipeline facilities
subject to the HLPSA.

Future Rulemaking Involving Smart Pigs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (hereinafter ``PLSA of 1992'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;508; Oct. 24, 1992) in sections 103 and 203 amended the NGPSA and the HLPSA, respectively, by requiring
the Secretary of Transportation to issue regulations that require the periodic inspection of gas transmission facilities
and hazardous liquid pipelines in high-density population areas, and hazardous liquid pipelines in environmentally
sensitive areas or crossing navigable waterways. In response to these mandates, RSPA will issue an NPRM proposing
to prescribe the circumstances, if any, under which such inspections would be conducted with smart pigs. In those
circumstances under which an inspection by a smart pig would not be required, RSPA is mandated to require the use of
an inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method that is at least as effective as the use of smart pigs in providing for the safety of the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to require all future new and replacement gas transmission lines subject to 49 CFR part 192
and hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide pipelines subject to 49 CFR part 195 to be designed and constructed to accommodate
the passage of smart pigs, except where impracticable. For the purposes of this rulemaking, RSPA proposed that it
would be impracticable to require the accommodation of smart pigs under the following categories of piping: Manifolds,
station piping (such as compressor stations, pump stations, metering stations or regulator stations), cross-overs,
and fittings providing branch line junctures (such as tees and other lateral connections). Additionally, the NPRM
proposed to allow pipeline operators to petition (minimum 90 days in advance) the Administrator, in a particular
case, for a finding that design or construction to accommodate a smart pig would be impracticable.

Advisory Committees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards
Committee (THLPSSC) have been established by statute to evaluate pipeline safety regulations. The TPSSC and the
THLPSSC met in joint session in Washington, DC on August 3, 1993, and considered the NPRM. Both committees accepted
the NPRM as feasible, reasonable, and practicable with the incorporation of several changes. RSPA's disposition
of the advisory committees' recommendations are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Discussion of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RSPA received public comments on the proposed rule change from 48 pipeline operators, seven pipeline-related associations,
three state/Federal agencies, and one consulting engineer. The following discussion explains how RSPA considered
the advisory committees' positions and the public comments on the proposed regulations in developing the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Low Stress Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twenty-three commenters indicated that the rule should except pipelines in which the internal operating pressure
results in low stress in the pipe wall. Many commenters argued that since gas transmission lines are not subject to
certain pipeline safety regulations (&sect;&sect;192.609, 192.711 &amp; 192.713) if they operate at or below 40
percent of the specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), that this rule should similarly not apply to these same transmission
lines. The TPSSC also recommended that piping operating at a stress level of 40 percent of SMYS or less be excepted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
While RSPA understands this position, it does not agree that it justifies exception of gas transmission lines based
solely on their low hoop stress at maximum operating pressure. Pipelines operating at lower stress levels are as susceptible
to corrosion and other types of damage, identifiable by smart pigs, as pipelines operating at higher stress. In addition,
the Reauthorization Act mandate to require certain new and replacement pipelines to be designed and constructed
to accommodate the passage of smart pigs limits RSPA's discretion only to situations that make such design and construction
impracticable. RSPA finds that an exception from the requirements adopted in this rule for pipelines operating at
or below 40% SMYS is not appropriate, because the pipe wall stress does not, within the terms of the Reauthorization
Act, affect the practicability of designing and constructing a line to accommodate passage of smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Short Lengths 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Eighteen commenters recommended that the rule except new or replacement pipelines based on their short lengths.
Some commenters recommended excepting replacement pipelines depending on whether the adjoining portions of the
pipeline are piggable. One of these commenters reasoned that unless the adjoining portion of pipeline can accommodate
the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices, there can be no added benefit from making a replacement
section piggable because the pipeline overall will still contain restrictions prohibiting inspection by smart
pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters recommended exception of minimum lengths that ranged from 2000 feet to 5 miles. A gas transmission
line operator recommended that the minimum excepted length should be the distance between compressor stations (40
to 60 miles), to exclude the necessity to replace non-full opening valves on short replacement sections. Four commenters
suggested that the minimum excepted length should be determined by RSPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disparity of the commenters' recommendations illustrates that there is no generally accepted rationale for
determining the minimum length, if any, of pipe that should be excepted. Moreover, RSPA does not agree that the rule
should except replacement pipelines based on either the length of the replaced section of pipeline or on whether the
adjoining portion of pipeline can accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plain objective of the statutory mandate is to make both short and long pipelines that are not now piggable from
end to end, piggable in time through replacements. Therefore, the final rule does not include these exceptions. However,
operators wishing to except short length pipelines may want to petition the Administrator under the procedures set
out in the new &sect;190.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Non-Steel Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Five commenters recommended that the rule apply only to steel pipelines. One commenter argued that current internal
inspection devices cannot monitor non-ferrous pipelines for stress corrosion. The commenter contends that no benefit
derives from the running of smart pigs on these lines, and therefore it would be unreasonable to require operators
to make them piggable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter contended that, although some polyethylene gas pipelines are by DOT definition transmission
lines, there are no smart pigs (except camera pigs) that are designed for use in plastic pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that the rule should except non-steel pipelines. It is true that smart pigs cannot presently monitor
non-steel pipelines for as many defects or anomalies as are detectable in steel pipelines. However, smart pigs can
currently detect some physical defects in non-steel pipelines; i.e. dents, change in internal diameter, ovality,
misalignment of joints, and change in position of the pipe. Moreover, by making new and replacement plastic pipelines
piggable, they will be able to accommodate new smart pig technology as it is developed. Nonetheless, all the exceptions
in this rule applicable to steel pipelines are also applicable to non-steel pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Small Diameter Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twenty-four commenters recommended that the rule except the smaller diameter pipelines. Some reasoned that commercially
available smart pig technology is limited to the larger pipe sizes. Consequently, for those sizes of pipe for which
there are no commercially available smart pigs, designing and constructing pipelines to pass smart pigs would be
impracticable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that the rule should include a blanket exception for all small diameter pipelines. In recent years
we have seen the increasing miniaturization of electro-mechanical components in equipment used in smart pigs and
we expect the trend to continue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RSPA understands that where no commercially available technology exists to inspect a particular pipe size by smart
pigs, the pipeline operator would lack sufficient technical information to establish the design and construction
criteria, e.g. minimum internal pipe diameter and minimum pipe bend radius, essential for passage of smart pigs.
Therefore, the final rule has been written to apply only to pipeline diameters for which there is a commercially available
smart pig at the time the new or replacement pipeline is designed. At the time of preparation of this document, RSPA
finds that 4 inches is the minimum nominal pipe size for which smart pigs are commercially available.

Gas Transmission Lines Operated in Conjunction With Distribution Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twelve commenters recommended that the rule except lines classified as transmission lines because their hoop stress
is 20 percent or more of SMYS, that operate in conjunction with gas distribution systems. They reasoned that, typically,
these lines have components and configurations that impede passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters reasoned that many of these transmission lines are the sole gas supply to large gas distribution systems.
So, inspection of these lines by instrumented internal inspection devices could, if problems develop while running
the inspection device, disrupt customer service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA does not agree that the rule should provide an exception for gas transmission lines that are operated in conjunction
with distribution systems (except as discussed under the heading ``Gas transmission lines in crowded underground
locations''). First, although such lines may have configurations or components that impede inspection by smart
pigs, the commenters did not provide information to substantiate the contention that these conditions are impracticable
to avoid on new or replacement lines. RSPA believes it is practicable to design and construct new and replacement transmission
lines operated in conjunction with distribution systems to accommodate passage of smart pigs. Second, potential
service disruption (from stuck smart pigs) on single feed transmission lines will not be a factor on lines that are
properly designed, constructed and maintained to accommodate smart pigs. Also, to further reduce the possibility
of the smart pig becoming stuck, prior runs can be scheduled, with cleaning and caliper pigs, during periods of minimal
load requirements. Third, the use of smart pigs to monitor the integrity of single feed transmission lines can detect
problems before they can affect the reliability of the gas supply to the customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Gas Transmission Lines in Crowded Underground Locations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twelve commenters recommended that RSPA except gas transmission lines located in certain urban areas. Most of them
pointed out that utility locations underneath city streets in downtown urban areas are typically overcrowded. Physical
constraints from other utilities and the structural boundary of available space make the design and construction
of replacement pipelines to accommodate smart pigs impracticable. For example, many underground utility locations
lack sufficient clearance between existing utilities to allow the replacement of existing short radius elbows with
longer radius elbows (which consume more space) to permit passage of smart pigs. Nonetheless, a commenter from a state
with few large cities suggested that internal inspection devices should only be required for pipelines located in
Class 3 or 4 locations and in environmentally sensitive areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While gas transmission lines operated in conjunction with distribution systems are generally covered under this
rule, RSPA agrees that the rule should provide an exception whenever gas transmission lines operated in conjunction
with distribution systems are located in certain congested urban areas. RSPA believes it is impracticable to design
and construct these particular transmission lines, considering the arguments presented above, to accommodate
passage of smart pigs when there exist physical constraints, not associated with the pipe itself, which are beyond
an operator's control. Furthermore, RSPA understands that underground utility areas in Class 4 locations are typically
overcrowded and unable to accommodate the pipeline configurations needed for the accommodation of smart pigs. So,
in the final rule, &sect;192.150(b)(6) excepts gas transmission lines that are: Operated in conjunction with a gas
distribution system and installed in Class 4 locations. However, gas transmission lines, not operated in conjunction
with a gas distribution system are not excepted because these lines generally pose greater risks, typically transporting
gas at higher pressures.

Gas, Oil and Carbon Dioxide Storage Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Twelve commenters recommended that the rule except gas transmission lines which are part of injection/withdrawal
systems at gas storage facilities. Commenters said these gas storage facilities have small diameter piping configured
in a grid-like pattern that would not permit the passage of smart pigs. The TPSSC likewise recommended that storage
facilities be excepted. Similarly, one commenter urged an exception of delivery/withdrawal piping associated
with hazardous liquid storage in breakout tanks, due to the short lengths, short radius bends and other tank farm piping
configurations which are unable to accommodate the passage of smart pigs. The THLPSSC also recommended that tank
farm piping be excepted from compliance with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA agrees that because of piping configuration constraints associated with the storage facilities for gas, hazardous
liquids and carbon dioxide it is generally impracticable for design and construction to accommodate passage of smart
pigs. Therefore, &sect;192.150(b)(3) of the rule excepts piping associated with gas storage facilities, other
than a continuous run of transmission line between a compression station and storage facilities, and &sect;195.120(b)(2)
excepts piping associated with liquid storage facilities. Nonetheless, RSPA will be studying underground storage
issues and, based on that work, may initiate rulemaking to address new safety measures that may be necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Emergencies and Unforeseen Construction Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NPRM proposed to exclude from the rule piping that the Administrator finds, upon petition by an operator, to be
impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of smart pigs. Eighteen commenters stated that
many construction situations are under tight contractual or other time constraints that do not allow sufficient
time to obtain a finding by the Administrator. For example, an operator may have to make immediate adjustments in the
field because of the discovery of obstructions or other unforeseen problems. Thus, some commenters reasoned that
while the Administrator would have at least 90 days to decide whether to grant a petition, most pipeline construction
projects would not allow delays of a few days. A few commenters suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators should be permitted to accept the ``burden of proof'' when encountering an impracticability during construction
and so inform RSPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the TPSSC recommended that the test for impracticability be left up to the operator instead of petitioning
the Administrator for a finding. The Committee suggested the wording ``and any other piping that the operator determines
and documents would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal
inspection device'' be substituted for ``the Administrator finds'' in the exception of &sect;192.150(b) from the
NPRM. Also, the TPSSC recommended that ``emergency repairs'' be added to the list of exceptions contained in &sect;192.150(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA acknowledges that emergencies, construction time constraints, and unforeseen pipeline construction problems
would not allow operators the time to petition for a finding of impracticability and wait for RSPA's response. Therefore,
RSPA has added &sect;&sect;192.150(c) and 195.120(c) which permit an operator discovering an emergency, construction
time constraint or other unforeseeable construction problem to make a provisional determination of impracticability.
In such instances the operator must document the circumstances resulting in its impracticability determination.
Within 30 days after discovering an emergency or a construction problem, the operator must petition under the new
&sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval'' for a finding by the Administrator that design and construction
to accommodate passage of internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, the operator
must modify the line section to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices, within 1 year after the
date of the notice of denial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Petitions for Finding or Approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The NPRM proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval'' be added to part 190 of this Chapter. Except as discussed above,
commenters did not oppose the establishment of a procedure to allow an operator to petition the Administrator for
an administrative ruling on any rule under parts 192, 193, and 195 in which the Administrator is authorized to make
a finding or approval. Heretofore, a similar procedure in part 193 (&sect;193.2015) applied only to petitions relating
to LNG facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this rule, the &sect;190.9 has been revised to require operators of intrastate pipelines located in states, participating
under section 5 of the NGPSA or section 205 of the HLPSA to direct their petitions to the state pipeline safety agency.
The participating state agency will then make a recommendation to the Administrator as to the disposition of the petition.

Restraining Elements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Nine commenters objected to the proposed requirement to add restraining devices to all fittings providing branch
line connections. Restraining elements are added when the outlet to the branch line could impede the passage of the
smart pig. Many commenters argued that the addition of restraining elements to these fittings may inhibit cleaning
of the branch lines by spheres or cleaning pigs. Other commenters pointed out that the use of restraining elements
in the main line is unnecessary whenever the branch line has a significantly smaller diameter than the main line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA agrees that the rule should not require restraining elements where they are unnecessary or make impracticable
other functions that are an essential and routine part of pipeline operations and maintenance. So, the rule does not
include a requirement for installing restraining elements, but leaves their installation to the discretion of the
operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Offshore Pipelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Eleven commenters recommended that the rule except offshore pipelines. Several commenters based their recommendations
on the fact that offshore pipeline networks are tied-in by ``hot-tapped'' or tee connections and these tie-ins are
without restraining elements. This type of construction permits cleaning pigs or spheres, required for removal
of materials (such as liquids from gas lines and wax from oil lines) that impede normal flow, to pass into laterals of
ever increasing diameters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The system design is contingent on the passage of these cleaning devices through the various laterals for final tie-in
to the liquid trunk (main) lines and to the gas transmission lines. Then, these larger diameter lines transport the
cleaning pigs to onshore facilities, for eventual retrieval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An operator of offshore gas systems said that because of the many subsea tie-ins to pipelines of larger diameter, smart
pigs will require some type of elaborate receiving device or physically disconnecting/lifting the pipeline; either
of which would be very expensive. Other commenters advised that smart pigs cannot be launched or received subsea.
An offshore operator said that new offshore platforms typically connect new platforms to an existing subsea network.
Connections to an existing subsea pipeline are ``hot-tapped'' or are extensions to existing laterals. This operator
summed up his recommendations by saying that it is impractical to design for the passage of smart pigs through these
connections and it is certainly impractical to install subsea traps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also stated that because of space limitations on the offshore platforms, the pipelines (risers) which
have been routed up onto the platforms have been designed and constructed with short radius bends and other fittings
that are only adequate for the launching of cleaning pigs or spheres. These commenters argue that the construction
of the risers with long-sweeping bends on the sea floor and on the platform, and the installation of the longer launchers
and receivers required to accommodate smart pigs, would be impracticable. For many of the same reasons, both the TPSSC
and the THLPSSC recommended that offshore pipelines be excepted from the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA acknowledges that many subsea pipelines have been designed and constructed without restraining bars on branch
line connections, because they would prohibit the passage of cleaning pigs and spheres. This design allows cleaning
pigs and spheres to pass through the network of subsea laterals and ultimately into larger transmission or trunk (main)
lines that transport gas or liquids to shore facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also apparent to RSPA, that designers of offshore platforms seldom anticipated the space required to accommodate
facilities necessary for the operation of smart pigs. Moreover, RSPA accepts that smart pigs cannot be launched or
received subsea. However, RSPA does not agree with the commenters or the two advisory committees that all gas and liquid
offshore pipelines should be fully excepted from this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For pipelines subject to part 195, the current &sect;195.120 requires that each component of a main line system, other
than manifolds, that change direction within the pipeline system must have a radius of turn that readily allows the
passage of pipeline scrapers, spheres, and internal inspection equipment. This requirement for main line components
to readily allow the passage of smart pigs through changes of direction has been in effect since 1970, when offshore
liquid lines became subject to part 195. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 192 has applied to offshore gas lines since 1971. In accordance with the requirements of section 108(b) of the
Reauthorization Act, RSPA sees the need for certain new and replacement offshore gas transmission lines and risers
from these lines to be designed and constructed to allow passage of smart pigs.

Accordingly, in &sect;&sect;192.150(b)(7) and 195.120(b)(6), while the rule has not excepted all offshore lines
and related facilities, it has excepted offshore lines which are not gas transmission lines or liquid main lines 10
inches or greater in nominal diameter that transport these commodities to onshore facilities. RSPA limited the accommodation
of smart pigs to these larger gas transmission and liquid main lines because we find, for the reasons expressed by the
commenters, that the unique design and construction of the excepted offshore pipeline systems makes them generally
impracticable for the passage of smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the rulemaking mandated by the PLSA of 1992 discussed under the heading_Future Rulemaking Involving Smart Pigs_is
issued, RSPA may prescribe the circumstances for inspection with smart pigs. Such circumstances, if included in
any final rule, may require the need for offshore platforms that contain risers, to also accommodate launchers and
(where appropriate) receivers for the passage of smart pigs.

Above Ground Pipelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Three commenters recommended that RSPA except above ground pipelines because operators can inspect these pipelines
visually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA finds that regardless of whether an operator can visually inspect a line above ground is irrelevant to the practicability
of design and construction of pipelines to accommodate passage of smart pigs. Furthermore, smart pigs are capable
of detecting internal defects that cannot be discovered by a visual inspection of the outside surface of a pipeline.
Moreover, above ground pipelines are required to be externally coated and coating materials usually preclude visual
inspection of the outside surface. So, this recommendation was not adopted.

Clarification of the Term ``Replacement''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Thirteen commenters recommended that the terms ``replacement transmission line'' and ``replacement pipeline''
be clarified to indicate the portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an existing line that must be modified to accommodate smart pigs when replacements are made for other reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A gas pipeline operator recommended that the meaning of the term ``replacement transmission line'' be limited to
the pipe and components such as valves, bends, and fittings which are added to or replaced in an existing transmission
line. Another gas pipeline operator expressed support for regulations stating that replacement pipeline facilities
could not be constructed which would further restrict the passage of a smart pig. RSPA cannot accept the first commenter's
recommendations because if ``replacement'' is limited to a replaced valve, a joint of pipe, or other component, then
pipelines with restrictive components, such as elbows and tight radius field bends (which when properly maintained
never need replacement) would never be piggable. Also RSPA cannot accept the second commenter's position because
it appears to mean that the operator need only to make the replacement no more restrictive than it was prior to it being
replaced. The clear intent of the congressional mandate is to improve an existing pipeline's piggability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pipeline operator and a pipeline related association, recommended that the word ``pipeline'' be replaced with
``line section'' defined in &sect;195.2. A gas pipeline association urged that ``replacement transmission line''
be changed to ``replacement transmission section'' to clearly indicate that only the portion of line replaced must
accommodate the passage of smart pigs. Another pipeline related association interpreted ``replacement'' to mean
either: (1) Replacement of the entire line, or (2) replacement of the line segment between two logical points (e.g.
compressor stations). A gas pipeline operator also believed the term ``segment'' is appropriate because it is frequently
used in part 192 and it recognizes that pipelines are segmented for different regulatory purposes. A gas transmission
operator felt that the definition of ``replacement line'' should exempt the replacement of partial segments of existing
gas pipelines within a valve section that are replaced because of class change or regular maintenance work because
of construction restraints. A gas distribution operator stated that if the proposal was intended to apply to the replaced
or relocated section only, then that limitation should be in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Congressional mandate requires the gradual elimination of restrictions in existing gas transmission lines
and existing hazardous liquid and carbon dioxide lines in a manner that will eventually make the lines piggable. Operators
are only required to remove the restrictions when replacements are made on the pipeline. On those occasions, the economic
burden of the upgrading is reduced because crews and equipment will be on the site and that portion of the pipeline will
need to be out of service. Six of the commenters appear to have considered the favorable economics when they recommended
that the upgrading for piggability cover the ``line segment'' or ``line section''. While ``line segment'' is frequently
used in the gas regulations it is not defined, although it's used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similarly to ``line section'' (one commenter suggested it was the distance between two logical points e.g. compressor
stations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in consideration of the comments ``line section'' is used in place of the term ``replacement transmission
line'' in part 192, and ``line section'' is used in place of the term ``replacement pipeline'' in part 195, as those
terms are used in the NPRM. ``Line section,'' as added to part 192 is similar to ``line section'' as it is defined in &sect;195.2.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part 195, ``line section'' is currently defined in &sect;195.2 to mean a continuous run of pipe between adjacent
pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and terminal or breakout tanks, between a pressure pump station
and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves. Now, in part 192 ``line section'' is defined in &sect;192.3 to
mean a continuous run of transmission line between adjacent compressor stations, between a compressor station and
storage facilities, between a compressor station and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, &sect;&sect;192.150(a) and 195.120(a) have been revised to clarify that when a replacement is made
of line pipe, line valve, line fitting, or other line component in an existing pipeline, covered by this rule, the complete
line section must be made to accommodate smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, RSPA has modified the final rule in response to the comment from the gas transmission operator that felt replacements
of certain partial segments within an existing valve section that are replaced because of MAOP class change or regular
maintenance work requirements, should be excepted because of construction constraints. Although, the construction
restraints were not specified, RSPA has addressed construction type problems with the procedure set out in &sect;&sect;192.150(c)
and 195.120(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Launchers and Receivers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Several commenters agreed with statements in the NPRM that installation of pig traps should not be required by this
rulemaking, but should be left to the discretion of pipeline operators. Also, a commenter agreed with the statement
in the NPRM that operators should determine where pig traps are to be permanently located based on individual operating
circumstances. A gas pipeline operator said that in a practical sense, it would be more cost effective to add launchers
and receivers at the time of construction rather than after the transmission line is in service (which could again
require the line to be taken out of service). The National Transportation Safety Board urged RSPA to revise its proposal
so that facilities for entering and removing smart pigs are required on all pipelines capable of being traversed by
such equipment. However, RSPA believes that revising the NPRM for this purpose would delay the regulatory effect
of this rulemaking and the requirement may be included in a future rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, as in the NPRM, RSPA has not included requirements for launchers or receivers. However, when the
rulemaking mandated by the PLSA of 1992 is issued, RSPA may prescribe the circumstances for inspection with smart
pigs. Such circumstances, if included in any final rule, may require facilities for launching or receiving smart
pigs. In the meantime, RSPA urges pipeline operators to consider the economic advantages of voluntarily installing
facilities, at the time of construction or replacement of pipelines, for launching and receiving smart pigs.

Exemption of Gathering Lines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Several commenters urged clarification of the exception for gas gathering lines in the proposed &sect;192.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the comments, RSPA agrees that clarification is needed. Therefore, the exception, of the new &sect;192.150,
has been retained and the current exception, as provided in &sect;192.1, has been referenced in the revised &sect;192.9.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in &sect;&sect;192.150(b)(7) and 195.120(b)(6), RSPA has excepted offshore pipelines other than gas
transmission or liquid main lines, 10 inches or larger, that transport gas or liquids to onshore facilities. Liquid
gathering lines, which are defined in &sect;195.2, are included in this exception.

Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Nineteen commenters discussed the economic impact and the majority found fault with RSPA's assessment that the rule

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would add minimally to the average expense of pipeline design and construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of information presented by the commenters, RSPA has excepted various categories of pipelines from the
final rule. These exceptions are: Piping associated with storage facilities, other than gas transmission lines;
piping sizes for which a smart pig is not commercially available; gas transmission lines, operated in conjunction
with a distribution system, which are installed in Class 4 locations; and offshore pipelines other than certain gas
transmission and liquid main lines. Additionally, operators are permitted to make a provisional determination
of impracticability in instances of emergencies, construction time constraints or other unforeseeable construction
problems that require immediate action. Other less urgent problems can be handled through the newly established
procedure in &sect;190.9, ``Petitions for finding or approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, these exceptions together with others carried forward from the NPRM substantially reduce the cost
of compliance with the rule. RSPA finds that the compliance costs will be minimal. A Regulatory Evaluation has been
prepared and is available in the Docket.

Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore,
is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget. The rule is not considered significant under the regulatory
policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA believes that the rule will add minimally to the average expense of pipeline design and construction. The information
RSPA has collected for the study under section 304 of the Reauthorization Act shows that about 90 percent of hazardous
liquid pipelines and 60 percent of gas transmission lines have been constructed to accommodate the passage of smart
pigs. This information confirms RSPA's field experience that most operators are now constructing new and replacement
gas transmission lines and hazardous liquid pipelines to accommodate smart pigs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RSPA lacks detailed information about carbon dioxide pipelines which recently became subject to part 195. However,
there are only about 10 such pipeline systems and we understand that they are not expected to grow in mileage or to require
a significant amount of replacement in the near term. Thus, those pipelines should not be greatly affected by the revision
of &sect;195.120.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the Federal Government
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), RSPA has determined that this final rule
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are very few small entities that operate pipelines affected by this rulemaking. To the extent that any small
entity is affected, the regulatory evaluation accompanying this rule shows that the costs are minimal. Based on these
facts, I certify that under section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this final regulation does not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each new pipeline and each line section of a pipeline
where the line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component is replaced; must be designed and constructed to accommodate
the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

(7) Other piping that the Administrator under &sect;190.9 of this chapter, finds in a particular case would be impracticable
to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints and other unforeseen construction problems
need not construct a new or replacement segment of a pipeline to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator
determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within
30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under &sect;190.9 of
this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection
devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial,
the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board is conducting research during fiscal year 1994
on whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas and their effect on persons
with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. Depending on the results of this research, the Access Board may
conduct additional research during fiscal year 1995 to refine the scoping provisions and technical specifications
for detectable warnings at these locations. Because of the issues that have been raised about the use of detectable
warnings at curb ramps and curbless entranceways to retail stores and other places of public accommodation, the Access
Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation are suspending temporarily until July 26,
1996 the requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools in
the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) so that the agencies can consider the results
of the research and determine whether any changes in the requirements are warranted.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 9, 1993, the Access Board published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing that it planned to conduct research during fiscal year 1994 on whether detectable warnings are needed
at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas and their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians.

 58 FR 37058. On the same day, the Access Board, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Transportation (hereinafter
referred to as ``the agencies'') published a joint notice of the proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to suspend temporarily the requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting
pools in the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) pending the research. 58 FR 37052.
In issuing the NPRM, the agencies noted that blind persons and their organizations had taken differing positions
regarding whether detectable warnings are needed at these locations; that persons with mobility impairments had
expressed concern that installing detectable warnings on the entire length of curb ramps would adversely affect
their ability to safely negotiate the sloped surfaces; and that a national association of retail stores had asserted
that installing detectable warnings on curb ramps and curbless entranceways to the stores would pose a tripping hazard
for their customers. The agencies stated in the NPRM that because of these potential safety issues they believed that
it would be in the public interest to suspend temporarily the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at the locations
noted above until the research provides additional information to address the issues.

Detectable warnings are a pattern of closely spaced, small truncated domes that are built in or applied to a walking
surface to alert persons who are blind or who have low vision of hazards on a circulation path. 36 CFR Part 1191, Appendix
A, Section 4.29.2. Research has shown that the truncated dome pattern is highly detectable both by cane and under foot.
The truncated dome pattern has been used as a detectable warning along transit platform edges for over five years by
the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in California and by the Metro-Dade Transit Agency in Florida. The truncated
dome pattern has also been used in Great Britain, Japan, and other countries as a detectable warning.

Over 150 comments were received on the July 9, 1993 NPRM. Another 110 comments concerning detectable warnings were
received in response to a NPRM published by the Access Board in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 21, 1992 which proposed to reserve detectable warnings provisions for curb ramps installed in the public
right-of-way by State and local governments. 58 FR 60612. The comments received in response to both the July 9, 1993
NPRM and the December 21, 1992 NPRM have been considered in this rulemaking. The comments came from blind persons and
their organizations (132 comments); State and local government agencies (54 comments); manufacturers of detectable
warnings (14 comments); professional and trade associations (11 comments); businesses (4 comments); organizations
representing persons with mobility impairments (4 comments); mobility specialists (13 comments); and other individuals
(17 comments) and entities (14 comments). About 25 persons submitted comments in response to both NPRM's. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments centered around three issues: whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and other locations;
their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians; and their durability, maintainability,
and cost. The comments are further discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Federation of the Blind (NFB), ten NFB chapters, and 31 blind individuals submitted comments supporting
the proposed suspension of the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas,
and reflecting pools. NFB further recommended that detectable warnings be eliminated eventually from ADAAG, including
at transit platform edges. NFB asserted that blind persons are responsible for using effective travel methods (i.e.,
cane or guide dog) and that public policy should be based on an ``individual responsibility'' standard. NFB pointed
out that blind persons move about safely every day without detectable warnings; and stated that fears of blind persons
falling or being injured are based on emotional responses and not factual information. NFB claimed that there are
sufficient cues already available in the environment to alert blind persons of hazards on a circulation path and that
if only some hazards are marked by detectable warnings, the inconsistency is likely to defeat their intended purpose
and could create a threat rather than an aid to safe mobility for blind persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Council of the Blind (ACB), 18 ACB chapters, the Council of Citizens with Low Vision International and
two of its chapters, the Guide Dog Users of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, the National Alliance of Blind Students,
the American Foundation for the Blind, the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually
Impaired, 15 other State and local organizations representing persons who are blind or who have vision impairments,
49 blind individuals, and eight mobility specialists submitted comments opposing the suspension. These commenters
recounted incidents of blind persons approaching curb ramps and stepping into the street without stopping; walking
into reflecting pools; and falling from transit platforms. News articles were submitted reporting the deaths of
three blind persons who fell from subway platforms in Boston and New York and from a commuter rail platform in Maryland
during 1993.

 Another news article reported an incident of a blind person who was severely injured from falling in front of an oncoming
train in Baltimore in December 1992.

Cues Blind Travelers Use to Detect Streets, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Washington, DC: American Council of the Blind (1993). Eight cities were included in the research project. In each
city, ten blind persons who use canes to travel approached ten unfamiliar intersections with curb ramps without detectable
warnings. They were asked to stop when they believed their next step would be into the street and to report the cues which
they used to determine where to stop. Of the 80 blind persons who participated in the research project, 75% were considered
good-to-excellent travellers by self-report and through assessment by orientation and mobility specialists;
and two-thirds reported travelling independently a minimum of five times a week. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 800 street approaches, the participants walked down the center of the curb ramps in 557 instances and stopped
before the street in 360 cases (65%). Of the 22 cues reportedly used to detect the street, the two most frequently mentioned
cues were the downslope of the ramp and the presence of traffic on the street perpendicular to the participant's line
of travel. Other cues frequently mentioned were the upslope or texture change at the street, the end of the building
line or shoreline, and the presence of traffic on the street parallel to the participant's line of travel. The participants

In the 197 instances (35%) where the participants walked down the curb ramp and did not stop before the street: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;There was traffic on the street perpendicular to the participant's line of travel in 116 cases (59%). The traffic
was moving in 75 cases and idling in 41 cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The participants took two or more steps into the street in 151 cases (76%). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the participants reported the presence of the traffic on the street perpendicular to their line of travel
and the upslope or texture change at the street as frequently used cues to detect the street, the research data indicate
that these cues are not sufficient to consistently and dependably identify the street.

The research project also analyzed participant variables such as frequency of travel, travel proficiency, cane

The research data also suggest that there is a strong relationship between the rate of change in slope between the walkway

The ten most difficult streets to detect (i.e., where most participants stepped into the street without stopping)
had a ramp with a slope of 4
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; or less and at least one of the following characteristics: a curb ramp parallel to the participant's line of travel;
a very quiet street or busy street with surges of traffic and gaps in traffic cues; no building line or a building line
that was different from others on the route; and little or no texture change or upslope at the street or a change which
was considered gradual. At one blended curb, all ten participants stepped into the street without stopping and five
of them crossed the entire street without detecting it despite an abrupt end to the shore line, a surface texture change,
and a slight lip where the street pavement overlapped the sidewalk.

[F]uture research could more precisely measure the curb ramps included in this project, and analyze performance
with relationship to these more accurate measurements. It may be possible that ramps which have 1:12 slopes facilitate

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high detection rates, while ramps of lesser slopes (e.g., 1:15) may be clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with low detection rates. If ramps of 1:12 facilitate high street detection rates, then it is possible
that the [ADAAG] requirement for detectable warnings on curb ramps could be limited, e.g., to ramps having slopes
less than 1:12. The requirement that detectable warnings extend over the entire surface of curb ramps is not supported
by empirical evidence that such an extensive tactile cue is necessary to alert blind travellers to the end of a curb
ramp and the beginning of a street. It is possible that a lesser amount of warning (24
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; or 36
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;) may be sufficient. If so, the optimal placement of the warning still remains to be determined. Suggested
locations are (1) on the lower end of the ramp, immediately adjoining the street; (2) on the upper end of the ramp; and
(3) around the sides and at the top of the ramp. Dimensions and location of detectable warnings need further empirical
research.

Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association (EPVA) initially supported the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings
and explained that it had changed its position after reviewing the data from the earlier Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
and Metro-Dade Transit Agency studies. The BART study conducted tests on level platform surfaces with 24 persons
with mobility impairments, including four manual wheelchair users. Five participants (21%) responded that the
detectable warnings would be helpful; eight (33%) responded that they were ``not affected''; seven (29%) responded
that they would be ``insignificantly affected''; four (17%) responded that they would be ``moderately impaired'';
and none responded that they would be ``seriously impaired.'' Three of the manual wheelchair users responded that
they would be ``insignificantly affected'' and the other one responded that he or she would be ``moderately impaired.''
Peck, A.F. and Bentzen, B.L., Tactile Warnings to Promote Safety in the Vicinity of Transit Platform Edges, Cambridge,
MA: Transportation Systems Center (1987). The Metro-Dade Transit Agency conducted tests with seven wheelchair
users on level platform surfaces. Five of the participants responded that they were ``not affected'' or ``insignificantly
affected.'' The other two had difficulty with the detectable warnings but their specific responses are not reported
in the study. Mitchell, M., Pathfinder Tactile Tile Demonstration Test Project, Miami, FL: Metro-Dade Transit Agency
(1988). Carsonite International, the manufacturer of the detectable warning materials used in the BART and Metro-Dade
Transit Agency systems, submitted a letter from BART stating that in over five years experience with detectable warnings
on its rail system, no problems have been observed with wheelchair users entering or exiting the trains.

The International Mass Retail Association, the National Grocers Association, the Food Marketing Association,
the Building Owners and Managers Association International, a regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial real estate association, 37 State and local government agencies, and four businesses expressed concern
that detectable warnings would pose a tripping hazard to other pedestrians and supported the suspension. Commenters
who opposed the suspension stated that concerns about the safety of others are speculative and unsubstantiated.
Several manufacturers commented that there have been no reported incidents of trips or falls attributable to their

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. A bank and a retail store chain stated that they had installed detectable warnings on curb ramps at their
sites and had received complaints from wheelchair users and elderly customers. Only one commenter, a local school
district, reported that an adult and some students had tripped while running over a curb ramp with detectable warnings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Transit Administration and Project ACTION of the National Easter Seal Society have recently sponsored
a research project on detectable warnings which among other things tested detectable warnings on curb ramps for safety
and negotiability by persons with mobility impairments. Bentzen, B.L., Nolin, T.L., Easton, R.D., and Desmarais,
L., Detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Warning Surfaces: Detectability by Individuals with Visual Impairments, and Safety and Negotiability for Individuals
with Physical Impairments, Cambridge, MA: Transportation Systems Center (1993). The study tested a variety of detectable
warning materials with 40 persons having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a wide range of physical disabilities. The participants included 15 persons who use mobility aids with wheels (power
and manual wheelchairs, and three- and four-wheeled scooters); 18 persons who use mobility aids with tips (canes,
crutches and walkers); and seven persons who do not use any mobility aid. The participants travelled up and down ramps
that were six feet long and four feet wide with a 1:12 slope, the maximum slope permitted by ADAAG for new construction.
Detectable warnings were installed on the entire six foot length of the ramps. For comparison, participants also
travelled up and down a brushed concrete ramp of the same dimensions. Subjective and objective measurements were
collected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 40 participants, the objective data showed that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;14 participants (35%) exhibited no difficulty negotiating the ramp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;19 participants (47.5%) exhibited few difficulties; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;7 participants (17.5%) exhibited numerous difficulties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latter group included four persons who used manual wheelchairs; two persons who used walkers with wheels (rollators);
and one person who wore leg braces and used a quad cane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physical therapist who observed the participants reported that persons using no mobility aids performed consistently
well on all the ramps with detectable warnings and that even those with protheses or braces showed good negotiability.
Persons using power wheelchairs, and three- and four-wheeled scooters demonstrated few, if any difficulties, on
any of the ramps with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detectable warnings. However, four of the five manual wheelchair users exhibited numerous difficulties negotiating
the ramps with detectable warnings, including exerting additional effort to go up the ramps, and the small, narrow
front wheels getting caught in the groves between the domes. Participants using canes, crutches, or walkers were
observed to have the most difficulties on the ramps with detectable warnings. Mobility aids with small tips (canes
or walkers) appeared to get caught between the domes or lay on an angle between the grove and the dome, causing the participant
to feel less stable. Participants who used crutches with larger tips appeared more safe and generally negotiated
the ramps with detectable warnings better than those who used canes or walkers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The research project report recommended that ``given even the moderately increased level of difficulty and decrease
in safety which detectable warnings on slopes pose for persons with physical disabilities, it is desirable to limit
the width of detectable warnings to no more than that required to provide an effective warning for persons with visual
impairments.'' The report suggested that a standard width of 24, 30 or 36 inches be established for detectable warning
surfaces and indicated that such widths would provide an effective stopping distance for 90 to 95% of blind persons
and persons with low vision.

Durability, Maintainability, and Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the commenters who supported suspending the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at curb ramps, hazardous
vehicular areas, and reflecting pools also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concern about the durability and maintainability of detectable warning materials, especially under
certain climatic conditions (e.g., snow and ice, and the need for snow and ice removal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that a member of the ANSI A117 Committee recently visited the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system
and observed a 50 to 60% ``failure rate'' with the corners of the detectable warning titles ``turning up and creating
tripping hazards.'' The commenter also cited a magazine article on the use of detectable warnings in Japan as evidence
that they are prone to breakage and deterioration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of various detectable warning materials responded with information about their products. Carsonite
International, the manufacturer of the detectable warning materials used in the BART system, stated that in its ten
years of experience, it is rare that the product or the adhesive fails. Where loosening or delamination has occurred,
it was due to a failure to properly prepare the substrate. Carsonite International also submitted a letter from BART
stating that annual costs for maintaining the detectable warnings at its 34 stations are $10,800 for materials and
8,160 hours of labor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another detectable warning manufacturer stated that its product has been in use for the past two winters in the Boston
area and that there have been no notable difficulties with snow and ice removal. The commenter also mentioned sites
in Ontario, Canada where detectable warnings have been installed and have performed well under tough winter conditions.
Other commenters who opposed the suspension noted that there were snow and ice removal techniques that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be used with detectable warnings without adversely affecting the efficiency of the overall snow removal operation
such as hot-air blowers, stiff brooms, and de-icing materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters who supported the suspension objected to the cost of detectable warnings but did not provide any specific
data. There are currently a variety of detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warning products on the market, including ceramic, hard composite, and resilient tiles; cast pavers; pre-cast concrete
and concrete stamping systems; stamped metal; rubber mats; and resilient coatings. The costs of these products range
from three to twenty dollars per square foot. One commenter mentioned that a university had installed detectable
warnings on 25 to 30 new curb ramps on its campus at an added cost of $5,000 for the entire project.

Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) submitted comments on the July 9, 1993 NPRM stating that
based on a comparison of trackbed falling accidents for the WMATA and BART systems, it believed that the granite edges
on its platforms are superior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
truncated domes. Based on this analysis, WMATA requested that the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings be
changed from truncated domes to granite edges. The truncated dome pattern was adopted in ADAAG because research has
shown that it is highly detectable both by cane and underfoot. WMATA did not submit any information showing that its
granite edge is equally detectable both by cane and underfoot. As WMATA noted in its comments, the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of trackbed falling accidents involving blind persons and persons with low vision are relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small in comparison to the millions of passenger miles traveled annually on our nation's rail systems to do any statistically
meaningful analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WMATA also recommended that research be conducted on the safety of the truncated dome pattern for other passengers
and that the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings in key stations and in newly constructed and altered rail
stations be suspended indefinitely. The truncated dome pattern has been used as a detectable warning on the platform
edges of all rail stations in the BART and Metro-Dade Transit Agency systems for over five years and no safety problems
have been reported by persons with mobility impairments or other passengers. The Access Board is conducting additional
research because questions have been raised whether experience from the rail station environment is transferable
to sloped curb ramps and curbless entranceways to retail stores. Additional research on the use of the truncated dome
pattern in rail stations is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
(SEPTA) referenced a NPRM published by the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Transportation on November 17, 1992 (57 FR 54210) which proposed to extend the deadline for retrofitting key rail
stations with detectable warnings until January 26, 1995. MTA and SEPTA stated that they did not believe that the proposed
extension provided sufficient time for them to complete testing products and to purchase and install the detectable
warnings. MTA and SEPTA requested that the deadline for retrofitting key rail stations with detectable warnings
be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delayed until the Access Board's research on use of detectable warnings on curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas
is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Transportation published a final rule on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63092) extending the deadline
for retrofitting key rail stations with detectable warnings until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 26, 1994. In the final rule, the Department of Transportation stated that ``[t]he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop-offs at the edges of rail station platforms create a clear, documented, and unacceptable hazard to persons with
visual impairments'' and that detectable warnings as specified in ADAAG will mitigate this hazard. The Department
of Transportation noted that many rail systems have been working with detectable warning manufacturers to address
concerns about durability and maintainability and that the extension provided for in the final rule was adequate
to permit an aggressive effort by rail systems to address concerns about installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Public Transit Association (APTA) submitted a comment stating that, if as a result of the additional
research conducted by the Access Board on the use of detectable warnings at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas,
the technical specifications for detectable warnings should be changed, rail systems could be placed in a position
of installing material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which could be found to be unsafe in other applications, and having to replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material later. If the research shows that detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous vehicular areas,
it is possible that some refinements may be made to the scoping provisions and technical specification for detectable
warnings (e.g., the location and width of detectable warnings for curb ramps; the types of hazardous vehicular areas
where detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warnings will be required). However, substantial change to the basic pattern of raised truncated domes is not anticipated.
The Department of Transportation has indicated in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule extending the deadline for retrofitting key rail stations with detectable warnings that if the technical
specifications for detectable warnings change in the future, the grandfathering provision in its regulations (49
CFR 37.9) could apply in appropriate situations to avoid making rail systems reinstall detectable warnings meeting
the revised specifications.

Final Common Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking raises some difficult issues. It involves making decisions about the safety needs of blind persons
and persons with low vision and considering their needs in light of the concerns expressed by persons with mobility
impairments and other commenters. The task is all the more complicated by the fact that blind persons and their organizations
have taken differing positions on the matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully reviewing the comments received on the July 9, 1993 and December 21, 1992 NPRM's and the reports of
the two recent research projects discussed above, the agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that it is in the public interest to suspend temporarily the ADAAG requirements for detectable warnings at
curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and reflecting pools while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional research is conducted on the need for detectable warnings at these locations and their effect on persons
with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The July 9, 1993 NPRM proposed that the suspension remain in effect until January 26, 1995. This date was first proposed
by the Access Board in November 1992. At the time, the Access Board envisioned that the additional research would be
completed in fiscal year 1994 and that the agencies would have an opportunity to review the results of the research
and, if necessary, initiate further rulemaking on detectable warnings before January 26, 1995. In subsequent planning
for the research project, the Access Board has divided the project into two phases. The first phase, which is scheduled
for completion in fiscal year 1994, will focus on whether detectable warnings are needed at curb ramps and hazardous
vehicular areas and their effect on persons with mobility impairments and other pedestrians. Depending on the results
of the first phase, an optional second phase may be conducted during fiscal year 1995 to refine the scoping provisions
and technical specifications for detectable warnings at these locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the second phase of the research project is conducted, the agencies will conduct further rulemaking to amend the
scoping provisions and technical specifications based upon the recommendations of the research project. Allowing
nine months for the rulemaking process from the end of fiscal year 1995, the joint final rule provides for the suspension
to remain in effect until July 26, 1996. Of course, depending on the results of the first phase of the research project,
the agencies could decide to conduct further rulemaking earlier. The July 26, 1996 date is the outside period by which
the agencies expect to complete all rulemaking on this matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested that the agencies provide guidance in this rulemaking on whether entities may be required
to retrofit existing curb ramps, hazardous vehicular areas, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflecting pools with detectable warnings at a future date under the program accessibility requirements for State
and local governments (28 CFR 35.150) and the readily achievable barrier removal requirements for public accommodations
(28 CFR 36.304). At this time, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premature to provide such guidance. The agencies will further address these questions after the research project
is completed and further rulemaking on the matter is conducted.

Regulatory Analyses and Notices

The agencies have independently determined that this final rule is not a significant

regulatory action and that a regulatory assessment is not required under Executive Order 12866. It is a significant
rule under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory Policies and Procedures since it amends the agency's ADA
regulations, which are a significant rule. The Department of Transportation expects the economic impacts to be minimal
and has not prepared a full regulatory evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies hereby independently certify that this proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to provide for the issuance of temporary flight
restrictions on certain operations when accurate altitude information is not available. The rule is warranted because
barometric pressure higher than 31.00 inches of mercury (inHg) (1049.8 millibars) exceeds the capability of standard
aircraft pressure altimeters and prevents the display of accurate altitude information. The rule provides restrictions
on certain flight operations during periods of abnormal atmospheric pressure conditions and is necessary to promote
flight safety during certain operations for which accurate altitude information is critical.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For several days in January 1989, weather observers in various locations in the State of Alaska recorded record-breaking
barometric pressure higher than 31.00 inHg (1049.8 millibars). These extremely high barometric pressures exceeded
the capability of standard aircraft pressure altimeters and prevented the display of accurate altitude information
on aircraft pressure altimeters. This condition occasionally extends to northern portions of the contiguous United
States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft altimeters indicate altitude based on a reading of the air pressure surrounding the aircraft. These altimeters
incorporate an adjustment for environmental barometric pressure that permits pilots manually to set the correct
pressure reading in the instrument. If the pressure setting is incorrect, the altitude readout also will be incorrect.
Because barometric readings of 31.00 inHg, or higher, seldom occur, standard altimeters do not permit barometric
pressures to be set above that level and are not calibrated to indicate accurate aircraft altitude when the surface
pressure exceeds 31.00 inHg. As a result, many altimeters cannot be set to display accurate altitude readouts to pilots
in conditions such as those that were experienced during the high pressure conditions in Alaska.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
It is possible to estimate the error in altitude for pressures above 31.00 inHg by adding 100 feet in aircraft altitude
for each .10 inHg. However, significant recurring training would be required to ensure all pilots correctly apply
the appropriate correction during the appropriate phase of flight. If two pilots flying aircraft in the same vicinity
are not applying the same correction, a highly dangerous situation is created when they are at the same altitude although
they believe they are at different altitudes relative to each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accurate altitude information is essential for normal flight operations and critical to certain phases of flight.
Without an accurate altitude reading, a pilot cannot safely execute an instrument approach in instrument weather
conditions unless certain restrictions are followed.

Proposed Rulemaking and Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 12, 1992, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) inviting all persons to submit written
comments on the proposed amendment to &sect;91.92 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (57 FR 8830). The FAA
received comments to the NPRM from the Air Traffic Control Association, the Air Transport Association (ATA), the
Airline Pilots Association, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), and the Canadian Airline Pilots Association (CALPA).
All five commenters responded favorably to the amendment; however, the ATA, KLM, and CALPA had additional comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA requested, for purposes of clarification, that the final rule state that the restrictions are to be applied in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
region when the barometric pressure exceeds 31.00 inHg. The FAA disagrees that the suggested additional language
is needed. The application of this rule is not intended to be limited to any geographical area, and discussion of regions
may lead to confusion concerning the rule's applicability. The final rule clearly states the rule is applicable to
any route of flight.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) suggested that a note addressing the Outer Marker (OM) crossing altitude as published
on the applicable instrument approach procedure be added either to the rule or as part of the NOTAM implementing the
rule. It argued that very low temperatures require an increase of the published (standard atmosphere) crossing altitude,
while extremely high barometric pressures would call for a decrease in the crossing altitude and that, in most cases,
both effects would cancel out each other. KLM stated, however, that if flight crewmembers only increased the crossing
altitude for temperature, as is the normal procedure, an incorrect crossing altitude would be computed that would
not provide an accurate check for intercepting the instrument landing system (ILS) glidepath.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA agrees with KLM that extremely cold temperatures and high barometric pressures, which usually accompany
one another, normally cancel out the effects of each other in altitude computations. The FAA does not believe, however,
that a note concerning this phenomenon is appropriate for the FAR. An appropriate note might be included in the Airman's
Information Manual (AIM). CALPA also commented that the NPRM contained no reference to corrections for extremely
cold air temperatures. It stated that Canadian airline procedure compensates for lower than normal ambient temperatures.
CALPA suggested adding to the final rule instrument approach procedures that contain tabulations allowing the pilot
to make corrections when very cold temperatures are experienced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is aware of the Canadian procedures on altimetry and recently completed a study entitled ``Extreme Cold Weather
Altimetry.'' At this time, however, the FAA has not developed any procedures as a result of the study. The FAA will amend
the rule should procedures formulated from this study dictate an amendment.

Temporary Restrictions on Flight Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the above discussion, the FAA finds that the occurrence of abnormally high barometric pressure conditions
creates an operational situation that requires immediate action to maintain safety of flight in the affected areas.
It is necessary for the FAA to issue temporary restrictions on certain instrument flight rules (IFR) approaches and
visual flight rules (VFR) operations while extreme weather conditions exist.

The specific restrictions authorized by this rule will be issued in a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) by each affected FAA
region when any information indicates the barometric pressure will exceed 31.00 inHg. Paragraph 7&hyph;531 of the
FAA Airman's Information Manual contains the procedures that will be put into effect by NOTAM when the pressure is
above 31.00 inHg.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These restrictions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. All aircraft: Set the altimeter to 31.00 inHg for en route operations below 18,000 feet mean sea level (MSL). Maintain
this setting until the aircraft is beyond the affected area or until reaching the final approach segment. At the beginning
of the final approach segment, set the altimeter to the current barometric pressure, if possible. If not possible,
leave the altimeter set at 31.00 inHg throughout the approach. Altimeters on departing aircraft or on aircraft on
missed approach will be set to 31.00 inHg before the aircraft reaches any mandatory/crossing altitude, or 1,500 feet
above ground level (AGL), whichever is lower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. During preflight, altimeters shall be checked, to the extent possible, for normal operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. If the aircraft is being operated into or out of airports with the capability of measuring the current barometric
pressure and the aircraft is equipped with an altimeter that has the capability to be set to the current barometric
pressure, no additional restrictions apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For aircraft operating under VFR, there are no additional restrictions; however, extra diligence is essential
in flight planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Airports without the capability for accurate measurement of barometric pressures above 31.00 inHg will report
the barometric pressure as ``in excess of 31.00 inHg.'' Flight operations to and from those airports are restricted
to VFR weather conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. For aircraft operating under IFR and equipped with an altimeter that does not have the capacity to be set at the current
barometric pressure, the following restrictions apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. To determine the suitability of takeoff airports, destination airports, and alternate airports, increase ceiling
requirements by 100 feet and visibility requirements by 1/4 mile for each .10 inHg of pressure, or any portion thereof,
over 31.00 inHg. These adjusted values are to be applied in accordance with the requirements of the applicable operating
regulations and operations specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. On approach, 31.00 inHg will remain set on the altimeter. Decision height or minimum descent altitude shall be deemed
to have been reached when the published minimum altitude is displayed on the altimeter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. These restrictions do not apply to authorized Category II and Category III ILS operations, nor do they apply to certificate
holders using approved QFE (absolute altitude) altimetry systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Regional Flight Standards Division manager of the affected area is authorized to approve temporary waivers
to permit emergency resupply or emergency medical services operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOTAM issuing the temporary restrictions will incorporate a reference to the rule.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order 12866. Therefore,
no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with Department of Transportation policies
and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the anticipated costs and benefits, which are summarized below. For more detailed
economic information, see the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule involves additional costs to aviators through delays in flying to airports experiencing extremely high
barometric pressure. The cost of the rule varies by the number of hours of delay, by the level of activity at the restricted
airports, and by the type of aircraft delayed. Data from the National Weather Service (NWS) was used to estimate the
amount of time airports will experience extreme high pressure. The discounted 10 year cost of this rule due to delays
resulting from the restrictions is estimated to be $3.0 million.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits of the rule are avoidance of midair collisions during periods of extremely high barometric pressure. These
meteorological conditions increase the risk of midair collision resulting from the inconsistency of altitude measurement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the FAA searched and did not find any midair collisions occurring under high barometric pressure, the combination
of low visibility conditions, such as at night or in fog, and lack of consistent altitude measurement increases the
risk for all aircraft in the airspace system under high barometric conditions. The rule will reduce that risk during
such weather conditions by establishing uniform procedures to reduce confusion and to prevent inadequately equipped
aircraft from flying into these conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pilots always risk a midair collision in busy airspace, and high barometric pressure heightens that risk. In Alaska,
the FAA recorded 28 near midair collisions from 1987 through 1989. Although the FAA cannot precisely quantify the
increase in risk, it is apparent that the risk of midair collisions increases substantially when pilots do not know
their precise altitude as under high barometric pressure. Additionally, the FAA estimates that the number of aircraft
flying in such conditions will increase by 30 percent over the next 10 years. The combination of increased risk due
to high barometric pressure and a nearly one-third increase in aircraft operating under these conditions makes a
midair collision much more likely. Without restrictions under high barometric conditions, there is a potential
for at least one midair collision. The discounted value of avoiding just one midair collision over the next 10 years
is $5.0 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates the discounted 10-year cost of the rule to be $3.0 million. This cost is the highest possible cost
assuming that all landings during extremely high barometric pressure are restricted. Aircraft with more sophisticated
avionics will be able to land even with restrictions in effect. Also, aircraft could land under VFR conditions. The
benefit of avoiding just one midair collision over the next ten years has a discounted value of $5.0 million, greater
than the estimated cost of the rule during that period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All foreign and domestic aircraft would be equally affected by this rule. Hence, this rule will have no effect on the
sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States. The rule also does not affect the sale of United
States products of services in foreign countries.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that government regulations do not needlessly and disproportionately
burden small businesses. The RFA requires FAA to review each rule that may have a ``significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA criteria set ``a substantial number'' as not less than 11 and at least one-third of the small entities subject
to the rule. Among air carriers, a small entity is defined as one that owns, but does not necessarily operate, 9 or fewer
aircraft. The criteria set ``a significant economic impact'' as follows: $101,988 for scheduled air carriers with
60 or more seats; $57,011 for scheduled air carriers with fewer than 60 seats; and $4,011 for unscheduled operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that in certain cases the cost of delays to small entities might exceed the threshold. However, the number
of small entities that this rule might affect is difficult to estimate. At any rate, only those small entities in Alaska
are likely to be affected by the rule since almost all extremely high pressure occurrences take place in Alaska. Of
the 77 part 135 commuters with 9 or fewer aircraft in the United States, 15 (or 19 percent) are located in Alaska. In the
case of unscheduled part 135 operators (air taxis) with 9 or fewer aircraft, only 6 percent of the 2,634 such operators
in the United States operate in Alaska. In each instance, the proportion of small entities exposed to costs under the
rule is considerably less than one-third.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the FAA determines that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

Federalism Implications

The regulation herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national
government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule will not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not significant under Executive
Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact, positive
or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The regulations
is not considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A regulatory
evaluation, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Trade Impact Analysis, has been placed in the
docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under

This rule proposes to amend the regulations to allow the Immigration and Naturalization Service (the Service) to
charge a fee for the processing and issuance of specified documents at land border Ports-of-Entry (POEs). Consistent
with Federal user fee statutes and regulations, the Service has identified services that are currently provided
free of charge and for which it would be appropriate to impose a fee. The revenue generated by the collection of fees
for these application processing services will enable the Service to improve service to the public at land border
POEs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Traffic at land border POEs has continued to increase dramatically in recent years. During FY 1992, Immigration and
Customs inspectors at land border ports completed more than 475 million inspections, representing an increase of
over 50 million more inspections than were completed in FY 1991. This growth in transborder traffic has made it increasingly
difficult to provide expeditious service to the traveling public. Immigration laws require that all applicants-for-admission
at land border POEs undergo a brief interview and preliminary screening in a primary vehicle or pedestrian lane. Those
found admissible are allowed to proceed without further delay. Persons who do not appear to be immediately admissible,
or who require further processing or documentation, are referred for a secondary inspection. Activities directly
related to secondary inspection include, among other duties, examining documents, conducting record checks, and
issuing permits for extended stays in the United States. Additionally, those submitting applications for benefits,
such as border crossing cards and boating permits, often require extensive interviews, as well as record checks,
document production, and other time-consuming paperwork.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, appropriated funds are the major source of funding for the staffing of land border POEs. This funding has
not kept pace with the increased workload at land border locations. Despite the increase in traffic affecting inspection
services, and resulting new construction needed to expand the capacity of many land border POEs, no substantial increase
in appropriated fund has been received for land border positions within the last ten years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has sought to identify those services that are currently provided free of charge for which it would be appropriate
to impose a fee. Generation of sufficient revenue to recover the costs of providing specific services, such as document-processing,
is consistent with the Federal user fee statute (31 U.S.C. 9701) and regulations which require that recipients of
special benefits bear the costs of providing those services. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A&hyph;25,
User Charges, states as a general policy that reasonable charges should be imposed to recover the full cost to the Federal
government of rendering such services. The specific application-processing services provided by the Service in
secondary inspection at land border POEs result in the issuance of documents that are beneficial to the specific user.
Therefore, it is appropriate that fees be charged to these users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule proposes to permit the Service to impose a fee at land border POEs for the processing of Form I&hyph;94, Arrival/Departure
Record, and I&hyph;94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Form; Form I&hyph;444, Mexican Border Visitors
Permit; Form I&hyph;68, Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit; Form I&hyph;175, Application for Nonresident Alien
Canadian Border Crossing Card for issuance of Form I&hyph;185, Nonresident Alien Canadian Border Crossing Card;
and Form I&hyph;190, Application for Nonresident Alien Mexican Border Crossing Card, to replace a lost, stolen,
or mutilated Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card, Form I&hyph;586.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to development of this proposal, the total cost of providing these specific services to the public was included
as part of the total Service budget and was not separately identified. The fees proposed in this rule were determined
by an analysis of document-processing services and associated costs, and are calculated to recover the direct and
indirect costs to the government of providing these special services and benefits. As the Service collects more detailed
information related to providing these specific services, refinements to the cost base may be necessary.

These services and processes include, among other things, interviewing applicants, determining validity of documents,
conducting background checks, verifying information, providing assistance to complete application forms, issuing
the appropriate documents, and the administrative and support activities associated with providing these services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appropriate fee for each application was primarily based on an assessment of the amount of inspector direct labor
devoted to processing each type of application. To arrive at this assessment, the Inspections Program obtained work
hour information directly from various INS field offices. The estimate derived from this survey was then applied
to the estimated volume of each type of application to determine the total estimated inspector direct labor required
for each application. The number of supervisory inspector hours required was determined by applying a standard ratio
to the inspector direct labor estimate. Resource levels for training, management, and administrative support were
determined based on the current ratio of these functions to the areas to which they normally provide support. The associated
costs were calculated based on the level of support that would be required to process each application. Other identifiable
costs related to a specific application, such as card production costs, were calculated and applied to the specific
application.

With the increase in transborder traffic, the demand for additional resources at land border POEs has become critical.
The collection of fees will allow the Service to support the secondary application-processing services provided
at land border POEs without depending on appropriated resources. Unlike appropriated funding, fluctuations in
fee revenues will correspond directly to fluctuations in workload. Consequently, in the event workload increases,
the level of fee resources available to fund the processing of applications would increase commensurately. It is
anticipated that the imposition of the fee-for-service charge will enable the Service to improve inspection services
at the land border. Once the fee revenues are available, appropriated resources formerly allocated to provide these
services may be redirected to augment staffing of vehicle and pedestrian traffic lanes. The resulting benefit would
be improved facilitation of traffic through the POE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific forms for which fees are being proposed are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forms I&hyph;94 and I&hyph;94W are issued to record the entry of many nonimmigrant aliens and serve as a form of alien
registration. These forms document the benefits of admission and permit the alien to travel anywhere within the United
States for a designated purpose and period of time. Payment of a fee will not be required when an I&hyph;94 is issued
for the purpose of paroling an alien into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form I&hyph;44 is issued in conjunction with presentation of a Nonresident Alien Border Crossing Card (BCC) or nonimmigrant
visitor's visa by a Mexican national requesting entry as a visitor for business or pleasure (B&hyph;1/B&hyph;2).
This form is issued in lieu of, and serves a similar purpose to, Form I&hyph;94, and is issued only to Mexican nationals
when they are traveling to the five-border-state area of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, or Texas for a period
not to exceed 30 days. Current procedure allows the inclusion of several persons on one Form I&hyph;444. The proposed
regulation will require a separate form with fee for each individual; however, there is a family fee cap applicable
to a husband, wife, and minor children under 18 years of age. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form I&hyph;68 may be issued to eligible United States and Canadian citizens and residents to allow pleasure boaters,
who have been previously inspected and issued the form, to enter the United States by small boat from Canada without
the necessity of reporting for inspection upon each entry. Considerable personnel resources and work hours are spent
each year in its issuance, including record checks and INS outreach activities at boat shows, recreational clubs,
and other similar gatherings to facilitate registration in the program. This rule also provides for the issuance
of a Form I&hyph;68 for each individual, rather than for each family group, although a family fee cap is applicable
to a husband, wife, and minor children under 18 years of age.

Form I&hyph;185 (CBCC) is issued to Canadian citizens or lawful permanent residents of Canada having a common nationality
with Canada and is intended to facilitate the entry of those individuals into the United States. Since these groups
are automatically waived passport and visa requirements when crossing the border into the United States, Form I&hyph;185
is normally issued in conjunction with an approved waiver of excludability pursuant to section 212(d)(3)(B) of the
Act. Form I&hyph;185 therefore serves as evidence of a long-term waiver of inadmissibility for the holder of the document.
Currently, no fee is charged for this benefit, although each application requires substantial time to adjudicate
and provides a clear benefit to the applicant by eliminating the need for a yearly waiver application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Form I&hyph;586 (BCC), and its former version Form I&hyph;186, offer the same privileges as the B&hyph;1/B&hyph;2
visa. The issuance of BCCs is a benefit which the Service performs voluntarily. No law or regulation requires the Service
to issue this document, which is an extremely desirable benefit to many Mexican nationals. Possession of the BCC allows
access to the area within 25 miles of the border for periods not to exceed 72 hours without the need for further documentation
upon each entry. With the issuance of other documentation, the BCC also allows travel to all parts of the United States
without the need to obtain a nonimmigrant visa and passport. The existing Agreement on Passports/Visas (Treaty)
between the United States and Mexico currently prohibits charging a fee for the initial issuance of a BCC. However,
the treaty does not specifically preclude charging a fee for replacement cards. The application process for replacement
is identical to the application for initial issuance, placing a significant demand on personnel resources. Institution
of a fee for the application for issuance of a replacement Form I&hyph;586 will help to make the process financially
self-supporting and substantially expedite issuance of the card.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The fees proposed
in this rule, calculated to cover only the costs of providing the service, are nominal, and will apply only to individuals,
not small entities. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does
this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with
Executive Order 12612.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;32&hyph;3) from Advanced
Medical Systems, Inc. The petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations because it believed that the requirements
of part 32, which are applicable to original manufacturers and suppliers, were not equally applicable to manufacturers
and suppliers of replacement parts. The petition is being denied because current regulations apply equally to manufacturers
and suppliers of both original and replacement parts, ensuring the integrity of these parts; therefore, no additional
requirements addressing the regulation of manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts are necessary. Further,
current regulations address service and maintenance of sources and devices possessed and used under an NRC license,
including replacement parts, whether manufactured or supplied by the original manufacturer or supplier or some
other manufacturer or supplier. Therefore the amendments suggested by the petitioner are not necessary.

The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a letter dated June 28, 1991, Advanced Medical Systems, Inc. (AMS) filed a petition for rulemaking with the NRC.
The petition was docketed by the Commission on July 19, 1991, and was assigned Docket No. PRM&hyph;32&hyph;3. The
petitioner requested that the NRC amend its regulations because it believed that the requirements of part 32, which
are applicable to original manufacturers and suppliers, were not equally applicable to manufacturers and suppliers
of replacement parts. The petitioner has suggested two alternatives for accomplishing this objective. The first
alternative is to insert the necessary language regarding manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts into
each appropriate section of part 32. The second alternative would revise the purpose and scope provisions of &sect;32.1
to include manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Basis for Petitioner's Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner identified itself as an original teletherapy equipment manufacturer. As such, it has a definite and
direct interest in the health and safety of the public who may use or be treated by equipment it manufactures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petitioner, it appears that the requirements of part 32 are being interpreted as applying only to
manufacturers and suppliers of original equipment and not to manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts,
devices, products, or sources designated for units originally manufactured or transferred by others. In the petitioner's
view, lack of specific requirements applicable to manufacturers and suppliers of replacement parts, devices, products,
or sources, can lead to use of inferior quality replacement parts which in turn can cause malfunction or failure of
devices, in particular teletherapy equipment, and thereby risk of overexposure. Advanced Medical Systems cited
two incidents as examples of this problem: Access No. M49250, Anderson Memorial Hospital, Anderson, South Carolina;
and Access No. M49324, St. Mary's Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan.

Public Comments on the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of receipt of the petition for rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 10, 1991 (56 FR 51182). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments concerning the petition.
The comment period closed December 9, 1991. The NRC received comments from the State of Illinois, Department of Nuclear
Safety, and the Department of the Air Force, Headquarters Air Force Office of Medical Support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Illinois, Department of Nuclear Safety, stated that the Department fully supports development of the
rule proposed in the petition. The Department further stated that the integrity of NRC evaluated devices (NRC or an
Agreement State evaluate for safety any devices containing radioactive materials) may be compromised significantly
if nonstandard replacement parts are used during the life of the device. While the Department agreed that the issue
of replacement components needs to be addressed, it was concerned with the use of the term ``replacement sources and
devices'' in the wording of &sect;&sect;32.74, 32.110 and 32.210 as suggested by the petitioner. The Department
believed that all sources and devices must be evaluated by the NRC or an Agreement State, whether or not they are considered
``original'' or ``replacement'' equipment. Therefore, the Department did not believe it is necessary to distinguish
between original or replacement sources or devices. The Department was in favor of the petitioner's suggested alternative
to modify &sect;32.1, Purpose and Scope.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Headquarters Air Force Office of Medical Support, Department of the Air Force, opposed the rule language proposed
by the petitioner, as written, although it agreed with the petitioner's intent to ensure that the safety and effectiveness
of devices not be compromised because original parts are replaced by inferior ones. They did not agree that all replacement
parts should be subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 32. They stated that NRC review and approval should apply
to replacements of parts or components that are essential to the proper and safe operations of a device. The Air Force
gave examples of parts (such as panel screws and covers) that conform to industry standards. These, the Air Force stated,
should not be subject to the proposed requirements. The Air Force voiced concern that the petition, as written, may
serve to restrict competition and would lead to greater expense which would have to be recouped through higher medical
costs from patients, or, in the case of the Air Force, from taxpayers.

NRC Action on the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC reviewed the petition, the public comments, and the two cases (incidents) cited by the petitioner as supporting
evidence for filing this petition. The NRC also reviewed its regulations pertinent to the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly after the NRC received correspondence
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 from AMS about the two cases, the NRC advised
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 AMS of its intention to investigate these incidents, especially with regard to the quality of service and replacement
parts used in servicing the teletherapy units. From October to December 1989, the NRC conducted a thorough investigation
which included three onsite inspections: Atom Mechanical Company, Cleveland, Ohio (The servicing company that
conducted the maintenance and replacement of parts in the two cases), St. Mary's Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan,
and Picker International, Highland Heights, Ohio (The company that manufactured the teletherapy units at Anderson
Memorial Hospital and at St. Mary's Medical Center). The NRC also referred the case of Anderson Memorial to the State
of Maryland, because the company that serviced the teletherapy unit there, Atom Mechanical Company, is an authorized
user on the Neutron Products, Inc. license, and Neutron Products is located in the State of Maryland, an Agreement
State.

The incident at Anderson Memorial Hospital was caused by a broken spring in a teletherapy unit which failed to retract
the source into the OFF position following a cobalt-60 cancer treatment. The hospital technologist promptly retracted
the source manually. According to the hospital report, the technologist received very little additional exposure
over expected monthly exposure, as evidenced by the individual's radiation film badge reading. Moreover, according
to the same report the delivered daily dose to the patient was less than the prescribed daily dose, i.e., no patient
overexposure for that treatment, because the technologist acted promptly. In its communication with NRC (prior
to filing the petition), AMS stated that it was concerned about the quality of the replacement springs used in the teletherapy
machine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incident at St. Mary's Medical Center was caused by the failure of a microswitch. The failure of the switch prevented
a timing device from operating properly, to automatically terminate the treatment. No misadministration occurred
because the subsequent treatment times were adjusted and the total delivered dose did not differ from the total prescribed
dose. Neutron Products, Inc. was called to repair the machine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current NRC regulations, persons authorized under a specific license to use devices containing byproduct
material (e.g., use of teletherapy equipment under a part 35 specific license) ultimately are responsible for the
safe use of these devices, and for assuring that such devices are properly maintained. Suppliers of sources or devices
containing byproduct material, whether they are an original manufacturer or a manufacturer of replacement sources
or devices, must be licensed under parts 30 or 32 or an appropriate Agreement State license, and also have responsibility
for the safety of the sources or devices that they supply or replace. Service or repair, which would include the replacement
of parts or components of medical or industrial sources or devices that present a risk of radiation exposure from the
failure of certain parts, such as the teletherapy devices discussed as examples in this petition, may be performed
only by qualified persons authorized under an NRC or Agreement State license (cf. &sect;&sect;35.605, and 39.43(e)).
Some generally licensed devices may be serviced by general licensees who are authorized to perform limited service
work if sufficient information about the service work (e.g., procedures, training, expected dose, etc.) is submitted
by manufacturer or initial distributor and accepted by the NRC. However, these devices typically are not mechanically
complex and do not present the same risk of significant radiation exposure. Moreover, the NRC has no record of failure
of these devices leading to a radiation exposure attributable to defective replacement parts or improper servicing.
Finally, under the provisions of part 21, the supplier of any basic component,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 whether or not a licensee of NRC or an Agreement State, is also responsible for the quality of the component, whether
it is original or replacement.

Reasons for Denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has examined the petition (1) in light of its regulations and policies for both general and specific licensees,
and (2) in view of the cases cited by the petitioner in support of the petition. The NRC is denying the petition because
current regulations apply equally to manufacturers and suppliers of both original and replacement parts, ensuring
the integrity of these parts; therefore, no additional requirements addressing the regulation of manufacturers
and suppliers of replacement parts are necessary. Further, current regulations address service and maintenance
of sources and devices possessed and used under an NRC license, including replacement parts, whether manufactured
or supplied by the original manufacturer or supplier or some other manufacturer or supplier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the petition for rulemaking is denied.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to Univair Aircraft Corporation
(Univair) Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and
F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes. The proposed action would require installing
inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion,
and repairing any corrosion found. Several reports of corrosion in the outer wing panels of the affected airplanes
prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent wing structural damage
that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received several reports of wing structure corrosion on Univair Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD,
415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney
M10 airplanes. At least four of these incidents revealed major corrosion in the outer wing panels.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current maintenance inspection provisions do not allow for thorough viewing of the wing structure. With this in mind,
Univair issued Service Bulletin (SB) No. 29, dated January 27, 1994, which specifies procedures for (1) installing
inspection openings in the outer wing panels, and (2) inspecting the outer wing panels for evidence of corrosion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above
including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent wing
structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Univair Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C,
415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A,
and Mooney M10 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing inspection openings in
the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion
found. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with Univair SB No. 29, dated January 27, 1994. The
inspection will become part of the affected airplanes' annual maintenance inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance time for the proposed AD is presented in calendar time instead of hours time-in-service (TIS). The
FAA has determined that a calendar time for compliance is the most desirable method because the unsafe condition described
by the proposed AD is caused by corrosion. Corrosion can occur on airplanes regardless of whether the airplane is in
service or in storage. Therefore, to ensure that corrosion is detected and corrected on all airplanes within a reasonable
period of time without inadvertently grounding any airplanes, a compliance schedule based upon calendar time instead
of hours TIS is utilized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 2,672 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take
approximately 8 workhours (maximum) per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate
is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $67 (maximum) per airplane. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,354,704. This figure is based on the assumption
that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket
at the location provided under the caption ``

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is reopening the record for the proposed revision of the
regulation of scaffolds used in shipyard employment (part 1915, subpart N) (53 FR 48182, November 29, 1988). This
reopening incorporates the entire record for scaffolds used in the construction industry (part 1926, subpart L)
(Docket S&hyph;205, 51 FR 42680, November 25, 1986; Docket S&hyph;205A, 58 FR 16509, March 29, 1993; Docket S&hyph;205B,
59 FR 4615, February 1, 1994) including the scaffold-related materials from the record for the proposed general industry
standard for walking and working surfaces (part 1910, subpart D) (Docket S&hyph;041, 55 FR 13360, April 10, 1990)
that were previously incorporated into the subpart L record in Docket S&hyph;205B. Through this notice, the Agency
also requests input on the scope and application of subpart N; the appropriateness of replacing the term ``capable
person'' with the term ``qualified person'' throughout subpart N; the maximum permissible distance between the
front edge of a platform and the face of a vessel or structure; the requirements for a scaffold that the Agency considers
to be an interior hung scaffold; the frequency of scaffold inspections; the qualifications for persons performing
scaffold inspections; and the requirements for the performance of electric welding operations from suspension
scaffolds. In addition, this notice corrects a typographic error in proposed paragraph &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv)
and invites public comment on that paragraph as corrected. The information received as a result of this action will
be used by the Agency in developing its final rule for scaffolds used in shipyard employment.

A. Scope and Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;1915.251(a)(1) reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Scope and application. (1) This subpart applies to all scaffolds used in shipyard workplaces and operations (including
shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking), but does not apply to construction operations in shipyards covered
under 29 CFR part 1926.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA received only two comments (Exs. 6&hyph;1 and 6&hyph;3) on this paragraph. Both of those commenters stated that
the inclusion of the construction standards in the application of the shipyard standards is inappropriate and would
be counterproductive to efforts to bring uniformity to shipyard employment through a vertical standard. They suggested
that this paragraph be changed in order to apply part 1926 only to work being performed in a shipyard by outside non-shipyard
employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that construction work in shipyards is performed by both shipyard employees and non-shipyard employees.
Shipyard employees fabricate and construct smoke stacks, tunnel sections, railroad cars, and bridge sections when
shipbuilding, ship repairing, and shipbreaking work are either unavailable or in short supply. This work involves
the use of scaffolds in shipyards. OSHA is considering whether all scaffold-related work performed at shipyards,
regardless of who performs the work, should be covered by standards in part 1915, subpart N. If the Agency adopts that
approach, subpart N will apply whenever employees perform work involving scaffolds, including construction operations
in shipyards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that several types of scaffolds specifically addressed in the proposed construction scaffold standards
were not addressed in the proposed shipyard scaffold standards. If the Agency were to adopt a comprehensive approach
to scaffold use in shipyards, it would incorporate the various construction scaffold standards into part 1915, except
that the shipyard scaffold standard's threshold height for the provision and use of fall protection (5 feet (1.52
m)) would apply. Placing those standards in part 1915 would make the proposed reference to part 1926 unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency is considering if the use of the term ``shipyard workplaces and operations'' in proposed &sect;1915.251(a)(1)
inappropriately limits the scope and application of proposed subpart N. Accordingly, OSHA is contemplating replacement
of the proposed term with the term ``shipyard employment'', so that the activities covered by subpart N would be described
accurately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is also considering whether the proposed exclusion of construction operations from the scope of subpart N should
be limited to outside contractors using non-shipyard employees. Under such an approach, the scaffold operations
of outside (non-shipyard) construction employers would still be subject to part 1926, subpart L. In addition, OSHA
would require that scaffolds addressed by part 1926, but not by part 1915, comply with part 1926, regardless of who
the affected employers and employees were. Accordingly, the Agency seeks comment on all or part of the following alternative
language for proposed &sect;1915.251(a)(1):

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Scope and application. (1) This subpart applies to all scaffolds, except as indicated below, used in shipyard
employment (e.g., shipbuilding, ship repairing, shipbreaking, and related employments), but does not apply to
construction operations being performed in shipyards by outside contractors using non-shipyard employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Types of scaffolds which are specifically covered by 29 CFR part 1926 subpart L, but which are not specifically
addressed by this subpart, shall meet the applicable requirements of part 1926 subpart L, except that fall protection
shall be provided for each shipyard employee working more than 5 feet (1.52 m) above a lower level on such scaffolds.

B. Qualified Person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposed in &sect;&sect;1915.252 (b)(11), (b)(12), (b)(18)(i), and (d)(4) that scaffolds be evaluated by
a capable person, and in &sect;1915.252(d)(7) that scaffolds not be erected, moved, dismantled, or altered except
under the supervision of a capable person. Furthermore, OSHA proposed the following definition, which is identical
to the definition of ``competent person'' in &sect;1926.32(f), for ``capable person'': 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Capable person'' means one who is capable of identifying existing and predictable hazards in the surroundings
or working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous to employees, and who has authorization to take
prompt corrective measures to eliminate them. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its meeting on November 20, 1991, the Shipyard Employment Standards Advisory Committee (SESAC) recommended (Tr.
p. 84) that OSHA replace the term ``capable person'' with the term ``qualified person'' throughout the shipyard standards
(29 CFR part 1915). Accordingly, OSHA is considering the appropriateness of replacing the term ``capable person''
with the term ``qualified person (QP)'' in the above-mentioned standards. The definition being considered for ``qualified
person (QP)'' is based on the definition for ``qualified'' found in &sect;1926.32(l) of the construction standards
to which the word ``person'' and the clause ``and who has authorization to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate
any such problems'' have been added in order to indicate clearly that a ``qualified person (QP)'', for the purposes
of subpart N, would have both the ability and the authority needed to correct problems. Accordingly, OSHA seeks comment
on the following definition, which would apply to subpart N only: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Qualified person (QP)'' means an individual who by possession of a recognized degree or certificate of professional
standing, or who, by extensive knowledge, training, and experience, has successfully demonstrated the ability
to solve or resolve problems related to the subject matter, the work, or the project, and who has authorization to take
prompt corrective measures to eliminate any such problems.

C. Maximum Distance Between the Front Edge of a Platform and the Face of a Vessel or Structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph &sect;1915.252(b)(4), which is effectively identical with proposed &sect;1926.451(b)(4),
reads as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The front edge of all platforms, except those on outrigger scaffolds, shall be positioned not more than 14 inches
(36 cm) from the face of the vessel, vessel section, building or structure being worked on, unless Type I guardrails
are erected along the open edge or body belt/harness systems are used to protect employees from falling. The maximum
distance for outrigger scaffolds shall be 3 inches (8 cm). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is concerned that allowing a 14-inch (36 cm) opening may not be justified by the nature of work performed in shipyards.
Unlike construction work, where an opening of up to 14 inches (36 cm) may be necessary if the structure is being constructed
outward toward the scaffold, the fabrication of vessels and similar structures by shipyard workers is not usually
conducted in that manner. Accordingly, OSHA seeks public comment on the appropriateness of reducing the maximum
space allowed between the front edge of a platform and the face of the structure. Should OSHA extend the 3-inch (7.62
cm) maximum distance provision for outrigger scaffolds to cover all scaffolds? Should OSHA set some other distance?
If so, what should that distance be? Please submit supporting information with any suggestions.

D. Interior Hung Scaffolds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA recently became aware of a type of scaffold used in shipyards that consists of single-level or multi-level platforms
suspended by several wire ropes attached to ``S'' hooks inserted through openings in the overhead longitudinal structural
members in tanks. Wire rope clips are used to form the ends of the ropes into eyes. Those eyes are placed over the bottom
of the ``S'' hooks. The platforms are supported by horizontal struts (usually, metal pipes) with slotted ends into
which the suspension ropes are placed with a bolt or wire placed at the end of the opening. The struts rest on wire rope
clips attached to the suspension ropes. OSHA is concerned that the proposed rules may not adequately address these
scaffolds. The Agency also has some concerns about the adequacy of the proposed requirements for suspension scaffolds,
in general. Accordingly, OSHA seeks public comment on the following issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. OSHA has characterized these scaffolds as a type of interior hung scaffold. To what extent is the above-described
characterization correct? If this characterization is correct, to what extent do the proposed requirements for
interior hung scaffolds (&sect;1915.253(p)) and the general scaffold requirements (&sect;1915.252) adequately
address the above-described scaffolds? To what extent does proposed Appendix A adequately address the above-described
scaffolds? What changes, if any, should be made in proposed subpart N to improve the coverage of the above described
scaffolds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Agency is concerned about the possibility that a suspension rope could be inadvertently disconnected from
an ``S'' hook, thereby allowing an interior hung scaffold to fall. Accordingly, OSHA is considering requiring that
the end of the ``S'' hook which supports the suspension rope be effectively closed. If so, what methods can be used to
close the hook? OSHA is considering if mousing (wrapping rope around the hook opening when the suspension rope is connected)
would adequately assure that the suspension rope did not disconnect from the ``S'' hook. What experience have employers
had with the use of mousing to close the hook opening? OSHA is also considering if locking hooks, such as required in
&sect;1910.66, Powered platforms, should be required. To what extent would the use of locking hooks be appropriate
with these scaffolds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Proposed paragraph &sect;1926.253(p)(3) requires that suspension ropes and cables on interior hung scaffolds
be connected to overhead supporting members by shackles, clips, thimbles, or equivalent means. To what extent do
the ``S'' hooks used on the above-described scaffolds constitute equivalent means of connection? Should OSHA prohibit
the use of ``S'' hooks for suspending these scaffolds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. OSHA is also concerned about the possibility that an ``S'' hook could be inadvertently disconnected from its support,
thereby allowing an interior hung scaffold to fall. Accordingly, OSHA is considering requiring that the ``S'' hooks
be secured to the overhead longitudinal structural members in tanks. If so, what methods can be used to secure them?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In its rulemaking for scaffolds used in construction, OSHA reopened the rulemaking record (58 FR 16509, March 29,
1993) to solicit comments and information regarding the feasibility of providing fall protection and safe access
for employees erecting and dismantling scaffolds, including interior hung scaffolds (proposed &sect;1926.452(t)).
The materials submitted in response to that notice (Ex. 34, with attachments) will be considered when OSHA drafts
the final rule for part 1915, subpart N. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency is considering requiring the provision and use of fall protection and safe access for employees
erecting and dismantling scaffolds used in shipyard employment. To what extent is it feasible for shipyard employers
to provide fall protection and safe access for employees erecting or dismantling scaffolds, such as the above-described
scaffolds, used in shipyard employment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. How would a fall protection requirement affect the erection and dismantling of scaffolds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. OSHA is considering requiring that measures be taken to prevent the swaying of vertical lines suspending employees
erecting or dismantling the above-described scaffolds. What measures have been taken to prevent such swaying? What
other methods would be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. OSHA is considering specifying a minimum diameter for wire ropes used to suspend these scaffolds. Proposed 1915.252(a)(4)(ii)
requires that ropes suspending catenary scaffolds be equivalent to at least one-half inch diameter wire rope. Would
that minimum diameter be appropriate for the above described scaffolds? If not, how should OSHA address the minimum
diameter for ropes used to suspend such scaffolds? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. OSHA is considering requiring that only improved plow steel wire rope be used as suspension ropes on scaffolds.
To what extent would such a requirement be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. OSHA is concerned that incorrect size wire rope clips might be used on the wire ropes used to suspend scaffolds.
Accordingly, OSHA is considering specifying that when clips are used they must be the right size for the rope. To what
extent would such a requirement be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. When a U-bolt wire rope clip is installed backwards on a wire rope (i.e., the saddle is placed on the dead end and the
U-bolt is placed on the live end of a rope), the live end may be damaged through contact with the U-bolt. OSHA is concerned
that the use of U-bolt wire rope clips could damage wire rope so that a rope is not capable of supporting a scaffold. Accordingly,
OSHA is considering prohibiting the use of U-bolt wire rope clips on suspension scaffolds. To what extent would such
a requirement be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The struts that support the platforms on the above described scaffolds usually rest on wire rope clips attached
to the suspension ropes. The clips usually are attached to only one section of the rope, instead of two sections as is
the case when an eye is formed in a rope. OSHA is concerned that wire rope clips, especially U-bolt clips, used in this
manner might not provide adequate support for a scaffold. OSHA is also concerned that wire rope clips, especially
U-bolt clips, used in this manner might damage a rope, reducing its load carrying ability (see question 11 above).
Accordingly, OSHA is considering prohibiting the use of wire rope clips in this manner, and seeks comment on the extent
to which wire rope clips adequately support the struts when used in this manner. Would it be appropriate for OSHA to
prohibit the use of U-bolt clips for this purpose, but to allow such a use of double-saddle clips? If the use of clips
is allowed for this purpose, (1) are clips necessary on the top of each strut as well as at the bottom in order to adequately
secure each strut to its wire rope, and (2) how many clips should OSHA require, as a minimum, for rigging these scaffolds?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. OSHA is considering requiring that measures be taken to prevent the unintentional dislodgement of a suspension
rope from the slot in a strut. Accordingly, the Agency seeks comment on the feasibility of complying with such a requirement.
If such a requirement is promulgated, should OSHA specify the use of a bolt and nut that are at least 1/2 inch (1.27 cm)
in diameter for this purpose? Also, Should OSHA prohibit the use of tie wires for this purpose? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. OSHA is concerned that suspension ropes used on the above-described scaffolds could be damaged through contact
with the struts or the overhead longitudinal structural members found in tanks. Accordingly, OSHA is considering
requiring that measures be taken to prevent damage to suspension ropes from contact with the struts or the overhead
longitudinal structural members. To what extent do the procedures currently used to rig such scaffolds prevent damage?
What, if any, changes to rigging procedures or equipment are needed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. OSHA is considering setting minimum requirements (such as length, diameter, thickness (wall thickness for pipes),
shape, or type of material) for the struts used to support the above-described scaffolds. What, if any, minimum requirements
should the Agency set for the struts? To what extent would struts currently in use satisfy any such requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. OSHA is concerned that scaffolds designed by persons lacking the necessary skills and knowledge may prove to be
unsafe. Accordingly, OSHA seeks comment on the level of expertise that should be required for persons who design scaffolds
and scaffold components. Should OSHA require that scaffolds and scaffold components be designed by a registered
professional engineer? Should OSHA require that scaffolds and their components be designed by a person who is ``qualified''
as defined in &sect;1926.32(l) (see discussion of Item B, above)? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. OSHA is considering prohibiting the performance of heavy structural repairs and steel erection from the above-described
scaffolds to prevent situations where an overload could occur. To what extent are structural repairs and steel erection
performed from such scaffolds? How reasonable would it be for OSHA to require that any such work be performed using
other means of access? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Proposed paragraph &sect;1915.252(e)(1)(i) requires that employees on catenary scaffolds, float scaffolds,
and needle beam scaffolds, all of which are non-adjustable scaffolds, be protected by personal fall arrest systems.
Since the above-described scaffolds and interior hung scaffolds in general are also non-adjustable suspension
scaffolds, OSHA is considering requiring the provision of personal fall arrest systems for employees working on
the above-described scaffolds. The Agency is also considering requiring personal fall arrest systems for suspended
scaffolds in general. To what extent are such systems currently provided to and used by affected employees? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. OSHA is considering requiring the use of guardrail systems on the above-described scaffolds. Accordingly, the
Agency seeks information on methods that are currently used to provide guardrail systems on those scaffolds. To what
extent are the ropes used to suspend the scaffold capable of serving as vertical supports in a guardrail system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. In what types of shipyard operations, other than for blasting and painting, are the above-described scaffolds
used? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Does the use of the above-mentioned scaffolds expose employees erecting, dismantling, or using them to any unique
hazards? If so, what are those hazards, and how can the employer prevent them or protect employees from them? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. OSHA is considering requiring that the suspension ropes on the above-described scaffolds be secured at the bottom
of the tank. To what extent are suspension ropes currently being secured? What methods are being used? What other methods
would be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. OSHA is considering requiring that the suspension ropes on the above-described scaffolds be kept in a vertical
position while employees are on the scaffolds. To what extent are suspension ropes currently kept in a vertical position?
What methods are being used? What other methods would be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. OSHA is considering requiring that platform units used on the above-described scaffolds be secured to the supporting
struts. To what extent are those scaffolds currently secured to the supporting struts? What methods are used or can
be used for securing the platform units to the struts?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Supported scaffolds and scaffold components shall be inspected for visible defects periodically and after any
occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity. Suspension scaffolds and scaffold components
shall be inspected for visible defects immediately after installation prior to their first use; periodically thereafter
(preferably before each use); and after any occurrence which could affect a scaffold's structural integrity.

This language does not specify who is to perform the inspection or what qualifications that person must possess, nor
does it specify how frequently inspections must occur. The Agency sought public comment in these matters for both
supported and suspension scaffolds in Issue 13 of the proposal. In that issue the Agency stated incorrectly that the
proposed rule required supported scaffolds and scaffold components to be inspected for visible defects prior to
each workshift and after any occurrence which could affect the scaffold's structural integrity. The Agency intended
all scaffolds and scaffold components to be inspected for visible defects prior to each workshift. However, proposed
paragraph &sect;1915.252(d)(3) simply expresses a preference for inspection before each use. The Agency also sought
public comment on whether the scaffold inspector should be an engineer, a qualified person, or a capable person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received three comments (Exs. 6&hyph;1, 6&hyph;3, and 6&hyph;7) in response to Issue 13. Two of these commenters
(Exs. 6&hyph;1 and 6&hyph;3) stated that the proposed rule uses specification-oriented language and is unnecessarily
restrictive, and that a thorough inspection before each workshift would be impossible and expensive. These two commenters
added that existing rule &sect;1915.71(b)(5), which requires that scaffolds be maintained in a safe and secure condition
and that defective components be replaced, is performance-oriented and has caused the industry to implement effective
programs to ensure safe scaffolds. They recommended the retention of existing &sect;1915.71(b)(5), and that proposed
&sect;1915.252(d)(3) not be included in the final rule. The other commenter (Ex. 6&hyph;7) stated that ``[s]caffolds
should be inspected by a capable person during and immediately after the system is anchored. Thereafter, the system
should be inspected daily by the employees using the system.'' This commenter added that the proposed frequency of
inspections adequately reflects current shipyard practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA does not believe that proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) is unnecessarily restrictive. To the contrary, OSHA is
concerned that proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) and existing &sect;1915.71(b)(5) might not adequately address
the hazards associated with the use of unsafe scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks public comment on the adequacy
of proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3), and on the appropriateness of replacing proposed &sect;1915.252(d)(3) with
the following language, which is the same as the corresponding proposed requirement for scaffolds used in the construction
industry (51 FR 42706, November 25, 1986) except that ``competent person'' has been changed to ``qualified person''
(see discussion of Item B, above):

F. Correction to Proposed &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The word ``not'' was inadvertently dropped from paragraph &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) when proposed subpart N was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (53 FR 48207, November 29, 1988). Due to a typographic error, proposed &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) Counterweights shall be removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preamble discussion for proposed &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) (53 FR 48188) clearly states that OSHA intended
to prohibit the removal of counterweights until the scaffold is disassembled. In addition, the Agency notes that
the corresponding provision in proposed part 1926, subpart L (&sect;1926.451(b)(18)(iv)) states that ``counterweights
shall not be removed&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' Proposed paragraph &sect;1915.252(b)(18)(iv) should have
read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) Counterweights shall 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 be removed from a scaffold until the scaffold is disassembled (emphasis added).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the proposed provision as corrected.

H. Performance of Electric Welding Operations From Suspension Scaffolds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA raised the issue of the regulation of electric welding on suspension scaffolds in Issue 2 of the NPRM (53 FR 46197).
The Agency asked for input on six precautions that might reduce the possibility of the welding current arcing through
the wire rope when welding is performed by employees on suspension scaffolds. OSHA received only one response to Issue
2. That commenter (Ex. 6&hyph;7) stated that the use of welding equipment on suspended platforms has not caused any
safety hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the issue of welding work performed while on scaffolds, OSHA seeks public comment on the following provisions that
are being considered for inclusion in the final rule. These requirements are the same as those found in section 6.2.9
of ANSI A10.8&hyph;1988 except that in paragraph (b) the term ``unit'' has been changed to ``scaffold'' so that the
language clearly indicates the Agency's intent.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To reduce the possibility of the welding current arcing through the suspension wire rope during the course of welding
from suspension scaffolds, the following precautions shall be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) An insulated thimble shall be used to attach each suspension wire rope to its hanging support (such as cornice hook
or outrigger). Excess suspension wire rope and any additional independent lines from grounding shall be insulated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The suspension wire rope shall be covered with insulating materials at least 4 feet (1.22 m) above the hoist. In
the event a tail line exists below the hoist, it shall be insulated to prevent contact with the platform. The portion
of the tail line that hangs free below the scaffold shall be guided or retained, or both, so that it does not become grounded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each hoist shall be covered with protective cover made from insulating materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In addition to a work lead attachment required by the welding process, a grounding conductor shall be connected
from the scaffold to the structure. The size of this conductor shall be equal to or greater than the size of the welding
process work lead and shall not be in series with the welding process or the work piece. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the scaffold grounding lead is disconnected at any time, the welding machine shall be shut off.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

Paragraph (b) above addresses suspension scaffolds with hoists but does not specifically address non-adjustable
suspension scaffolds (i.e., scaffolds that do not have hoists). The Agency believes that employees performing welding
operations from non-adjustable suspension scaffolds are exposed to the same or similar hazards as those faced by
employees on adjustable suspension scaffolds. Accordingly, the Agency seeks public comment on the following issues:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should OSHA require that wire ropes on non-adjustable suspension scaffolds from which employees are performing
welding operations be insulated to a height above the scaffold sufficient to prevent accidental contact between
the ropes and an active welding rod or an uninsulated welding lead? If so, what should that height be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Should OSHA require that an insulated thimble or equivalent be used to attach each suspension wire rope to the platform
of a non-adjustable suspension scaffold used for welding operations? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What other measures should OSHA require for the protection of employees performing welding from suspended scaffolds?

I. Incorporation of Dockets S&hyph;205, S&hyph;205A, and S&hyph;205B (Part 1926, Subpart L, Scaffolds Used in the
Construction Industry)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 25, 1986, the Agency proposed to update the requirements for protection of employees on scaffolds used
in construction (part 1926, subpart L, 51 FR 42680). The public record on scaffolds used in construction was reopened
on March 29, 1993 (58 FR 16509), and again on February 1, 1994 (59 FR 4615). The proposed construction industry requirements
for scaffolds were generally consistent with those proposed for shipyards in 1988. The construction proposal and
the two notices of limited reopening generated public input which OSHA is considering as the Agency drafts the final
rule for scaffolds covered by part 1926, subpart L. Many of those materials contain relevant information or raise
scaffold-related concerns not yet addressed in the comments on part 1915, proposed subpart N. The Agency believes
that, in developing separate standards for the construction industry (part 1926) and for the shipyard industry (part
1915), the substance of those standards should be consistent, except where there are demonstrable differences in
scaffold use which would justify differences in coverage. Therefore, OSHA has determined that the Agency needs to
consider the information generated in the subpart L rulemaking when the Agency drafts the final rule for scaffolds
in the shipyard industry. In addition, OSHA notes that Docket S&hyph;205B also contains scaffold-related materials
from the proposed general industry standard for walking and working surfaces (Docket S&hyph;041, part 1910, subpart
D) and an August, 1993, NIOSH study of construction-related fatalities titled Fatal Injuries to Workers in the United
States, 1980&hyph;1989: A Decade of Surveillance. In order to assure that those relevant materials are considered
by both the Agency and the public as they relate to scaffold use in shipyards, OSHA is incorporating pertinent exhibits
from the construction industry rulemaking record (Dockets S&hyph;205, S&hyph;205A, and S&hyph;205B) into the
part 1915, subpart N rulemaking (Docket S&hyph;047). All the materials incorporated from subpart L will be identified
in the subpart N docket as Exhibit 8, with attachments.

J. Costs, Benefits, and Technological Feasibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the regulatory analysis accompanying the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 29, 1988, the Agency identified three provisions that would impose compliance burdens: (1) Requiring
scaffolds to be no more than 14 inches from the vertical work area unless there was a guardrail or body belt employed;
(2) prohibiting the use of ladders on top scaffolds; (3) forbidding workers to ride on mobile scaffolds unless the
surface to be driven over was free of hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments from the shipyard industry about the costs of these provisions, other provisions in
the original proposed rule, and the issues raised in this notice, especially the use of interior hung scaffolds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to update the rulemaking record, the Agency solicits information regarding: (1) The annual number of accidents
(especially falls) that occur while workers are engaged in erecting or working on scaffolds; (2) the annual number
of workers injured; (3) the severity of injuries; and (4) the causes of accidents. OSHA also solicits comments regarding
the extent to which shipyard scaffold accidents will be avoided by complying with the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also requests comments, with supporting information, about the technological feasibility of applying
the proposed standard, including the alternatives set out in this notice, to the shipyard industry.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft proposed regulations would replace existing regulations under 34 CFR part 361 governing The State Vocational
Rehabilitation Services Program. These draft proposed regulations, however, do not include the provisions relating
to order of selection under 34 CFR 361.36 that were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 for comment on July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38482). Final regulations relating to the order of selection requirement will be
published as a separate document later this year. In addition, these draft proposed regulations do not implement
section 106 of the Act relating to evaluation standards and performance indicators for The State Vocational Rehabilitation
Services Program. Proposed regulations implementing section 106 will also be published separately for public comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Staff from OSERS and other offices of the Department of Education will be available at the meetings and teleconferences
to discuss the draft proposed regulations and provide technical assistance and clarification of the proposed provisions.
Participants are particularly encouraged to express their support for or raise concerns about specific sections
of the regulations and, if possible, to provide alternative language if they disagree with the wording in the draft
proposed regulations.

The Assistant Secretary encourages interested parties to participate in one of the meetings or teleconferences.
There will be three meetings held in Washington, DC. Additional meetings will be held in Chicago, Illinois, and Oakland,
California. There will be three teleconferences to allow individuals to participate who cannot travel to the meeting
sites. Individuals will have to reserve a space for the meetings or teleconferences. Reservations will be accepted
on a first-come, first-served basis. Both meeting space and teleconference lines are limited. Given the level of
response expected, individuals should plan on participating in only one meeting or teleconference and should make
reservations as soon as possible. When making reservations, individuals must indicate the need for any special accommodations,
including sign language interpreters. The meeting rooms and proceedings will be accessible for individuals with
disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meetings in Washington, DC, will be held on April 19, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.; May 12, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon;
and May 17, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon. The location for these three meetings is the Mary Switzer Building, room 3065,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its rating schedule regarding evaluation of diseases
of the ear and other sense organs. This amendment is necessary in order to comply with a General Accounting Office (GAO)
study, which recommended that medical criteria in the rating schedule be reviewed and updated. The intended effect
is to update the portion of the Schedule for Rating Disabilities pertaining to diseases of the ear and other sense organs
to ensure that it uses current medical terminology and unambiguous criteria for evaluating these disabilities and
reflects recent medical advances.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to the advance notice of proposed rulemaking published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 2, 1991, we received comments and suggestions from VA medical doctors and VA Rating Specialists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments included suggestions that we delete several diagnostic codes, include diagnostic codes for additional
conditions, and change evaluation criteria for a number of conditions. We have considered all of these suggestions
and implemented several as explained in the following proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If medical terminology in the rating schedule is outdated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is difficult for a rating specialist to accurately associate medical evidence with the proper evaluation criteria.
For that reason, we propose to update the medical terms which identify diseases of the ear so that the schedule uses
the most common terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking, we also contracted with an outside consultant
to recommend changes to the evaluation criteria to ensure that the schedule uses current medical terminology and
unambiguous criteria, and that it reflects medical advances which have occurred since the last review. The consultant
convened a panel of non-VA specialists to review that portion of the rating schedule dealing with hearing and ear conditions
in order to formulate recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to adopt many of the recommendations the contractor submitted. Some recommendations, however,
addressed areas other than evaluation criteria, such as percentage evaluations and frequency of examinations.
Since these suggestions are clearly beyond the scope of the contract and deal with issues which would affect the internal
consistency of the entire rating schedule rather than one section, we have generally not adopted them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to change the terminology describing several of the conditions in this section for clarity and to reflect
current medical terminology. Under diagnostic code 6201, the term ``otitis media, catarrhal, chronic'' is outdated
and we propose to replace it with ``chronic otitis media, with effusion (serous otitis media).'' Similarly, ``chronic
otitis externa'' is the medically preferred term for ``auditory canal, disease of'' and we propose to use it as the
heading for diagnostic code 6210. Meniere's syndrome (diagnostic code 6205) is often referred to as ``endolymphatic
hydrops'' and we propose to add this designation in parenthesis to the heading of this diagnostic code. When first
included in the rating schedule, the term ``chronic labyrinthitis'' under diagnostic code 6204 was used to indicate
pathology affecting organs of equilibrium. That term, however, is not used in current medical practice; these conditions
are currently described as vestibular disorders. For this reason, we propose to change the heading of code 6204 to
``peripheral vestibular disorders.'' Since the word ``neoplasm'' connotes a pathological abnormality better
than the term ``new growth,'' we propose to substitute that word under diagnostic codes 6208 and 6209, which pertain
to malignant and benign conditions, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of grammatical elements are useful in eliminating ambiguity and ensuring that the schedule presents rating
criteria as precisely as possible. We are proposing editorial changes, primarily of syntax and punctuation, throughout
this portion of the schedule. These changes are intended to clarify the rating criteria and represent no substantive
amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.85 describes the use of tables VI and VIa in the evaluation of hearing impairment. Table VI is a chart of average
puretone decibel losses and speech discrimination percentages, with conversion to Roman numeral designations
where the values intersect. Table VIa assigns Roman numeral designations to ranges of average puretone decibel loss
without regard to speech discrimination. The Roman numeral designations derived from tables VI or VIa for each ear
are then transferred to Table VII and combined to yield diagnostic codes and disability percentages from 0 to 100.
Higher numeric designations equate to a higher disability percentage. Currently table VIa is reserved for cases
of language impairment or inconsistent test results, and table VI is used in all other hearing loss ratings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on research and statistical studies conducted by the Veterans Health Administration, we propose the addition
of two new provisions to &sect;4.85. The first new provision, designated as &sect;4.85(d), directs that the rating
specialist choose the higher Roman numeral designation derived from table VI or VIa whenever puretone thresholds
in four of five specified testing frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hertz (Hz)) are 55 decibels hearing
level (dBHL) or more. While results of speech discrimination tests with this type of hearing loss in a controlled setting
are often near normal, they do not reflect the true extent of difficulty understanding speech in the everyday work
environment, even with the use of hearing aids. Table VIa, which measures pure tone loss only, will be used as an alternative
to the combination of speech discrimination and pure tone scores for this particular configuration of hearing loss,
but only if it results in a higher evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second new provision (&sect;4.85(e)) directs that the rating specialist choose the higher Roman numeral designation
derived from table VI or VIa when puretone thresholds are 30 dBHL or less at frequencies of 1000 Hz and below, and are
70 dBHL or more at 2000 Hz. The rating specialist will then elevate the Roman numeral designation to the next higher
number. This type of hearing loss is an extreme handicap in the presence of any environmental noise, and often cannot
be overcome by the use of hearing aids. It is therefore appropriate to assign the next higher numeric designation in
order to compensate for this outcome. The intended effect of these two new provisions is to fairly and accurately assess
the hearing disabilities of veterans as reflected in a real life industrial setting and is thus a liberalization of
the current version of this section of the Schedule.

Table VII currently includes a footnote indicating entitlement to special monthly compensation when the criteria
for a 100 percent evaluation are met. Entitlement to special monthly compensation under 38 CFR 3.350(a) (38 U.S.C.
1114(k)) for total deafness is only one of many instances in which hearing loss is a factor in establishing special
monthly compensation. Because the criteria for entitlement to special monthly compensation contained in 38 CFR
3.350 are extremely complex, we propose to delete the footnote in favor of a note following &sect;4.85 directing rating
specialists to refer to &sect;3.350 when evaluating any claim for impaired hearing to determine whether the veteran
is entitled to special monthly compensation. We believe that this will be more effective than the footnote in ensuring
complete review for special monthly compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 4.86, 4.86a, and 4.87 currently deal with tests to evaluate hearing loss, evidence of hearing loss other
than puretone and controlled speech audiometry, and the definition of impaired auditory acuity. All three of these
provisions are closely related to the evaluation of hearing loss and should be included in one section. We propose
to state that the evaluations are designed to measure best uncorrected hearing, reflecting the accepted testing
method of measuring hearing without hearing aids in place. We therefore propose to reorganize this material so that
it is contained in a single section, &sect;4.86, and to delete &sect;4.86a. Section 4.87a has been redesignated as
&sect;4.87. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suppurative otitis media is currently classified under diagnostic code 6200, and mastoiditis under diagnostic
code 6206. Since mastoiditis is often a complication of suppurative otitis media, we propose to include mastoiditis
under diagnostic code 6200 and delete diagnostic code 6206. Cholesteatoma is another condition associated with
suppurative otitis media, and we propose to include it under diagnostic code 6200 as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diagnosis of ``otitis interna,'' (diagnostic code 6203), is archaic and the medical advice we received indicates
it is no longer a recognized category of disability. For this reason, we propose to delete diagnostic code 6203 from
the schedule and to rate the symptoms attributed to this condition under peripheral vestibular disorders, code 6204.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to amend the NOTE which currently follows diagnostic code 6204 to state that objective findings supporting
the diagnosis of disequilibrium are required prior to the assignment of any compensable evaluation. This requirement
will preclude the use of purely subjective symptoms as the exclusive basis for payment of compensation. The words
``severe,'' ``moderate'' or ``mild'' now precede the evaluation criteria for compensable evaluations under diagnostic
codes 6204 and 6205. These descriptions do not materially help to explain or clarify the specific evaluation criteria
they precede. For that reason, we propose to delete these labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation criteria under the diagnostic code for Meniere's disease (6205) currently require ``frequent episodes''
for an evaluation of 100 percent. We propose to clarify this ambiguous requirement by specifying that such attacks
must occur more than once weekly for this level of disability since, in our judgment, such frequency would most reasonably
constitute total disablement. We also propose to include the criteria of deafness to the 60 percent evaluation, since
this is a common symptom of the disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current evaluation criteria for loss of auricle, code 6207, are unclear because they do not specify the extent
of loss required to qualify for the various evaluation levels. We propose to revise the criteria to indicate that the
30 percent evaluation requires complete loss of one auricle and that the 50 percent evaluation requires complete
loss of both. This is consistent with the current instructions for the 10 percent evaluation which require a quantifiable
loss of one-third or more of one auricle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the likelihood of serious disablement and the severe side effects which chemotherapy and radiation treatment
produce in the average person, we propose to assign a 100 percent evaluation under the diagnostic code for malignancies
(6208), with the total evaluation continuing after the cessation of surgical, X-ray, antineoplastic or other theraputic
procedure. We propose to continue the total evaluation under this code indefinitely after treatment is discontinued,
and to examine the veteran six months thereafter. If the results of this or any subsequent examination warrant a reduction
in evaluation, the reduction would be implemented under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e). This method has the advantage
of offering the veteran timely notice of any proposed action and, under the provisions of 38 CFR 3.105(e), the opportunity
to present evidence showing that the action should not be taken. This is consistent with evaluation of malignancies
which we have proposed in other parts of the Schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation for benign neoplasms of the ear (diagnostic code 6209) currently instructs the rater to evaluate the
condition based on impairment of function, with a minimum evaluation of 10 percent. Likewise, there is an instruction
to add 10 percent to the evaluation for residuals of malignant new growths. We propose to delete these minimum evaluations.
Advances in reconstructive surgery have reduced the disability associated with this condition and loss of function
is the most accurate way of evaluating the residuals of this condition. Since any disability sufficient to warrant
a compensable evaluation would be noted on VA examination, a minimum evaluation is no longer appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation for tinnitus (diagnostic code 6260) currently requires that the condition be ``persistent'' in order
to qualify for a 10 percent evaluation. Tinnitus is a subjective sensation which, under certain circumstances, comes
and goes. The word ``persistent'' suggests a meaning of constant, and we propose to replace it with ``recurrent,''
meaning that the tinnitus might not always be present, but that it does return at regular intervals. Requiring that
tinnitus be ``recurrent'' will allow a realistic evaluation of the typical disablement from this condition.

Tinnitus can be caused by a number of conditions, including injuries, acute diseases and drug reactions. Compensable
evaluation for persistent tinnitus is currently restricted to conditions caused by head injury, concussion or acoustic
trauma. Since the severity of disablement from tinnitus does not depend on its origin, we propose to eliminate the
restriction that tinnitus result from trauma, and provide instead for a compensable evaluation whenever tinnitus
is recurrent. We also propose to remove reference to diagnostic code 8046 (cerebral arteriosclerosis), and to remove
reference to tinnitus under diagnostic code 6204 (peripheral vestibular disorder) in order to allow separate evaluations
for tinnitus when caused by cerebral arteriosclerosis and peripheral vestibular disorder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No change is proposed in &sect;4.87b, which provides evaluations for loss of smell (diagnostic code 6275) and taste
(diagnostic code 6276) except wording changes in the NOTE following, for clarity, and redesignation of the section
as &sect;4.87a.

The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason
for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries
could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and
final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of &sect;&sect;603 and 604.

(a) Examinations will be conducted using a controlled speech discrimination test together with a puretone audiometry
test. The horizontal rows in Table VI represent levels of speech discrimination determined from the controlled speech
discrimination test. The vertical columns in Table VI represent levels of puretone decibel loss determined from
the puretone audiometry test. The Roman numeral designation of impaired efficiency (I through XI) is determined
at the point where the horizontal row (percentage of speech discrimination) and the vertical column (puretone decibel
loss) intersect. For example, with 70 percent speech discrimination and average puretone decibel hearing loss of
64, the Roman numeral designation is V. Each ear will be evaluated separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The percentage evaluation will be determined from Table VII. The horizontal row of Roman numeral designations
represents the ear having the better hearing and the vertical column the Roman numeral designations for the ear having
the poorer hearing. The percentage of disability and the diagnostic code are located at the point where the row and
column intersect. For example, if the better ear (horizontal row) has a Roman numeral designation of ``V'' and the
poorer ear (vertical column) has a Roman numeral designation of ``VII,'' the row and column intersect where the percentage
evaluation is 30 percent and the diagnostic code is 6103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Table VIa provides Roman numeral designations based solely on puretone decibel hearing loss averages. It is for
application when the Chief of the Audiology Clinic certifies that language difficulties or inconsistent speech
discrimination scores make the combined use of puretone decibel hearing loss and speech discrimination inappropriate.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has decided to withdraw the proposed rulemaking to exempt Omega Phase Transformations, Inc. (Omega) from processing
prohibitions in the Asbestos Ban and Phaseout (ABPO) Rule and not to initiate rulemaking in response to a similar petition
from Vitrifix, Inc. (Vitrifix). Omega and Vitrifix had petitioned EPA for exemptions from the ABPO Rule for thermal
processes that convert asbestos-containing waste material into non-asbestos glass, and EPA had agreed to initiate
rulemaking to exempt such processes from the ABPO Rule. EPA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 2, 1992, to grant an exemption to Omega for its vitrification process. EPA has since decided that thermal conversion
processes that destroy asbestos are not prohibited by the ABPO Rule. Accordingly, the exemption rulemaking is unnecessary.

I. Background and Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 12, 1989 (54 FR 29460), EPA issued the ABPO Rule at 40 CFR 763.160&hyph;763.179 under section 6 of the Toxic Substances
Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2605, to prohibit, at staged intervals, the manufacture, importation, processing
and distribution in commerce of several categories of asbestos-containing products identified in the ABPO Rule.
One banned category is ``new uses of asbestos,'' which is defined in the ABPO Rule as ``commercial uses of asbestos
not identified in &sect;763.165 the manufacture, importation or processing of which would be initiated for the first
time after August 25, 1989'' (40 CFR 763.163). ``New uses of asbestos'' are banned by the ABPO Rule after August 27,
1990 (40 CFR 763.165(a), 763.167(a), and 763.169(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 18, 1991, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 947 F2d 1201 (5th Cir., 1991), vacated and remanded most of the ABPO Rule. The ban on ``new uses of asbestos'' is unaffected
by the Court's remand and remains in effect. For a more complete discussion of the decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, see 58 FR 58964, November 5, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ABPO Rule specifies that applications for exemptions for new uses of asbestos will be treated as petitions to amend
the ABPO Rule pursuant to section 21 of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2620) (See 54 FR 29464, July 12, 1989 and 40 CFR 763.173.) Section
21 of TSCA provides, in part, that any person may petition EPA to initiate a proceeding for the issuance, amendment,
or repeal of a rule issued under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8. The petition must set forth the facts which it claims establish
the need for the action. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days after filing. If EPA grants the petition,
EPA must promptly commence an appropriate rulemaking (15 U.S.C. 2620(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ABPO Rule also establishes general requirements for submission of data that are needed for EPA decisions on all
exemption applications, including those submitted as section 21 petitions (40 CFR 763.173). Petitioners must submit
evidence which demonstrates, among other requirements, that the proposed manufacture, importation, processing,
distribution in commerce, and use, as proposed, will not present an unreasonable risk of injury to human health (40
CFR 763.173(d)(1)(ix)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to requests for clarification of the ABPO Rule from the State of California (September 29, 1989) and Omega
(October 13, 1989) with respect to ``processes that transform asbestos into asbestos-free material'' EPA responded
that ``processing for commercial purposes asbestos-containing material (ACM) by vitrification, or other transformation
processes, was a `new use' within the meaning of the [ABPO Rule].'' Therefore, it was subject to the Rule and to the exemption
application procedures outlined in the Rule. EPA also noted that the ABPO Rule ``does not regulate disposal activities''
and:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
operations that transform asbestos-containing materials, as defined in 40 CFR 61.141, into nonasbestos material
solely for disposal, (as an alternative disposal method under the asbestos NESHAP regulations), would be subject
to the disposal requirements at 40 CFR 61.151 or 61.152, or any final standards revising the asbestos NESHAP under
40 CFR 61.155.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Letter to State of California, Department of Health Services, dated March 29, 1990. See also, letter to Omega, dated
March 30, 1990). The National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants Standard for Operations that Convert
Asbestos-containing Waste Material into Non-asbestos (Asbestos-free) Material (the Asbestos NESHAP Standard)
went into effect in November 1990 (40 CFR 61.155).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1990, Omega submitted a TSCA section 21 petition to EPA requesting an exemption from the ABPO Rule's ``new
use'' prohibitions in order to operate its vitrification process at a location in California. Omega's proposed process
converts ACM (e.g., demolition debris from asbestos abatement projects) into glass. Omega proposed to sell the glass
as aggregate for paving material, among other uses. In addition, the metal ingots produced from the molten metal waste
by-product would be sold as scrap metal. The Omega vitrification process is a modification of glassmaking technology
which would utilize high temperatures over 2000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to melt the asbestos fibers. Evaluation of the Omega process for the proposed rule indicates that when asbestos
is exposed to temperatures over 2000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, the needle-like structure of asbestos fibers breaks down to form amorphous molten glass and asbestos fibers
are destroyed. The Omega petition was followed by a section 21 petition from Vitrifix, Inc., on November 26, 1990.
An earlier feasibility test conducted by Vitrifix for EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards demonstrated
that, under the test conditions utilizing high temperatures over 2000 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, ACM waste material was converted into non-asbestos material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA granted Omega's and Vitrifix's section 21 petitions on January 7, 1991, and February 20, 1991, respectively,
indicating its intent to initiate rulemakings under TSCA section 6 to amend the ABPO Rule to allow Omega and Vitrifix
to operate their proposed vitrification operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 2, 1992 (57 FR 23183), EPA issued a proposal to amend the ABPO Rule to allow vitrification by Omega. EPA never
issued a proposed rule to allow vitrification by Vitrifix. EPA has reached the conclusion, as explained below, that
thermal processes that convert asbestos into non-asbestos material are not governed by the ABPO Rule. It was not the
intent of the ABPO Rule to regulate processes that permanently remove asbestos from the environment. Rather, the
objective was to prevent introduction of new asbestos into the environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ABPO Rule specifically prohibits ``processing for any use'' an asbestos-containing product listed in 40 CFR
763.165, including ``new uses of asbestos'' (40 CFR 763.167). The ABPO Rule, however, does not prohibit disposal
or processing for disposal. Because thermal conversion operations destroy asbestos fibers, such operations constitute
processing for disposal and do not constitute use of asbestos as contemplated by the ABPO Rule, and are, therefore,
not regulated by the ABPO Rule. EPA is revising its initial response on the issue of vitrification (as set forth in EPA's
March 29, 1990, letter to the State of California) to reconcile the function of these operations with the intent of
the Rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation is consistent with EPA's overall intent when it promulgated the ABPO Rule. In general, EPA developed
the ABPO Rule to limit the introduction or continued marketing of additional asbestos products, rather than to regulate
disposal of products that were already in use when the ABPO Rule was issued. In keeping with the overall objective to
reduce entry of asbestos into commerce and into the environment, the ABPO Rule does not prohibit other distribution
activities undertaken solely to dispose of asbestos. (see generally 40 CFR 763.163). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some situations, thermal conversion operations may still be subject to the ABPO Rule. If the end product contains
asbestos that has not been converted into glass, for example, and the end product is used for any purpose, the operation
would be subject to the prohibition against processing for use in &sect;763.167 of the ABPO Rule. In that case, an exemption
would be necessary to engage in the activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As building materials deteriorate, or as buildings are renovated or demolished, much of this asbestos waste will
require disposal. In a national survey of asbestos-containing friable materials in buildings, conducted in 1984,
EPA estimated that approximately 20 percent of all buildings have some asbestos-containing friable materials.
EPA further estimated that buildings targeted in the survey contained approximately 1.2 billion square feet of sprayed-
or trowelled-on ACM (in an estimated range of 18,000 to 365,000 buildings), and that approximately 16 percent (or
between 239,000 - 888,000 buildings) contain asbestos pipe and boiler insulation. EPA also estimates that approximately
31,000 schools contain asbestos. (

Asbestos in Buildings - A National Survey of Asbestos-Containing Friable Materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 - EPA Publication No. 560/5&hyph;84&hyph;006, October 1984, EPA Docket No OPPTS&hyph;62105). In addition to building
materials, asbestos is a component of automotive brakes, clutches and transmission components, as well as other
commercial and industrial friction materials which are eventually discarded for disposal after the components'
useful life. The magnitude of asbestos waste requiring disposal will place an increasing economic burden on society
as landfill capacity decreases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By converting asbestos into glass, vitrification provides an alternative to land disposal of asbestos waste and
produces a commercially useful non-asbestos product. Vitrification avoids costs of landfilling and of health costs
associated with exposure to asbestos waste. These costs could include a substantial burden on the individual and
society, including medical costs of treating asbestos-related diseases resulting from exposure to asbestos throughout
the life cycle of asbestos products and disposal of asbestos waste. The asbestos vitrification process destroys
asbestos and eliminates any risks from asbestos exposure which occur in the disposal and landfill stages of the asbestos
fiber life cycle.

III. Asbestos Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several existing regulations provide protection against asbestos exposures and releases from asbestos conversion
operations if such facilities are established. Owners or operators of facilities that intend to commence operations
to convert asbestos-containing waste material into non-asbestos material are subject to permit and performance
requirements under the Asbestos NESHAP Standard and to certain reporting requirements under several other EPA regulations.
In addition, such companies would be subject to the worker protection requirements of the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) or of OSHA-approved state, or EPA asbestos worker protection standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Asbestos NESHAP Standard was established as an alternative to land disposal of asbestos waste (55 FR 48406, November
20, 1990). The Standard establishes permit and performance requirements, including a requirement to obtain EPA
approval to construct a facility, as well as monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. During normal
operations, a company must demonstrate by laboratory analysis that ACM is completely destroyed. If laboratory testing
reveals that the output material contains asbestos, the company must reprocess the ACM, or dispose of it as asbestos-containing
waste material according to 40 CFR 61.150. Continuous monitoring requirements are also imposed under &sect;61.155
of the Asbestos NESHAP Standard. The Standard is designed to ensure that there are no visible air emissions and that
the output material contains no asbestos. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities may also be subject to public disclosure and notification requirements under
the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) (42 U.S.C. 11001 11050). Among other things, EPCRA
requires emergency notification of any release of 1 pound or more of friable forms of asbestos to the appropriate State
Emergency Response Commission and Local Emergency Planning Committee. Section 313 of EPCRA requires submission
of Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports to EPA and designated State officials, including the amount of the toxic
chemical entering each environmental medium, such as air and water, annually. Asbestos thermal disposal facilities
would be subject to section 313 of EPCRA only if they fall within the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes
20-39, they employ the equivalent of 10 full time employees, and they manufacture, process, or otherwise use a listed
toxic chemical in excess of the TRI reporting thresholds. Conversion of material containing friable forms of asbestos
into non-asbestos glass that is distributed in commerce is subject to section 313 reporting if the facility otherwise
meets the SIC Code and threshold requirements. Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101&hyph;13109),
facilities that are required to file a TRI report under EPCRA section 313 must include with it certain additional information
about toxic chemical source reduction and recycling. Under the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), certain releases must also be reported to the National Response Center and advertised
in local newspapers (42 U.S.C. 9663, 9611 (g)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities are also subject to OSHA, EPA, or State laws for occupational exposure to asbestos
in the workplace (see e.g., 29 CFR part 1910 and 1926 and 40 CFR 763.120&hyph;763.125). These laws all set permissible
exposure limits to asbestos and establish required work practices to protect workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asbestos thermal disposal facilities must also obtain construction approval from other appropriate Federal, State
and local authorities.

EPA has established a record of those documents EPA considered in addressing Omega's and Vitrifix's petitions. The
record consists of documents located in the file designated by docket control number, OPPTS&hyph;62105 located
at the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC). A public version of the record, without any confidential
business information, is available in the TSCA NCIC for reviewing and copying from noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard proposes to amend the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations by establishing new procedures for determining
Great Lakes pilotage rates, and revising the financial reporting requirements mandated for Great Lakes pilot associations.
The proposed methodology would adopt methods which have proven effective in ratemaking methodologies used by regulators
of other public service industries. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) does not propose a change to the existing
Great Lakes pilotage rates and charges, but proposes to standardize the methodology by which those rates would be
determined in the future.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 (Pub. L. 86&hyph;555, 46 U.S.C. 9301 et seq.), vessels of the United States
operating on register and foreign vessels must engage a U.S. or Canadian registered pilot when traversing the waters
of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Pilotage Act, as amended, vests the Secretary of Transportation with responsibility
for setting pilotage rates. The Great Lakes Pilotage Act 49 U.S.C. 9303 provides that the Secretary shall prescribe
by regulation rates and charges for pilotage services, giving consideration to the public interest and the costs
of providing the services. This authority, except for the authority to enter into, revise or amend arrangements with
Canada, has been delegated to the Commandant of the Coast Guard by 49 CFR 1.46 (a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Currently, the navigable waters of the Great Lakes are divided into eight pilotage areas. United States registered
pilots, along with their Canadian counterparts, provide pilotage services in areas 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Pilotage
area 3 (the Welland Canal) is currently a wholly-Canadian area where only Canadian pilots provide services. Pilotage
areas 2, 4, 6, and 8 are ``undesignated waters.'' Pilotage areas 1, 5, and 7 are ``designated waters.'' Pilots are required
to direct navigation of vessels in designated waters. Pilots are required to be on board and available to direct navigation
in undesignated waters. The seven U.S. pilotage areas are grouped together into three pilotage districts. District
1 consists of areas 1 and 2. District 2 consists of areas 4 and 5. District 3 consists of areas 6, 7, and 8. Each district
has its own pilot association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9305 of the Pilotage Act provides that the Secretary of Transportation, subject to the concurrence of the
Secretary of State, may make agreements with the appropriate agency of Canada to prescribe joint or identical rates
and charges. The latest Memorandum of Arrangements between Canada and the United States specifies that the Secretary
of Transportation and the Minister of Transport will arrange for the establishment of regulations imposing identical
rates. In the past, consultations resulted in nominally identical U.S. and Canadian rates. Not only are generally
uniform rates required by the agreement with Canada, but they are also important from the standpoint of predictable
costs for vessels requiring pilotage. However, there are differences in the cost bases and in the operating organizations
of the U.S. and Canadian pilots, particularly with regard to pilot compensation. These differences need to be taken
into account in reaching identical U.S. and Canadian rates. Therefore, the proposed methodology, like its predecessor,
would not translate directly into new rates, but rather would form the basis for proposals to be negotiated with Canada.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 7, 1988, the Department of Transportation published the Great Lakes Pilotage Study Final Report (1988
DOT Pilotage Study). The study revealed weaknesses in accounting for the expenses incurred by the pilot associations
and the need to formally establish the factors used in establishing pilotage rates. On April 25, 1990, the Coast Guard
published a final rule (55 FR 17580) establishing improved audit requirements and general guidelines and procedures
to be followed in ratemaking (CGD 92&hyph;072). In May, 1990, the Inspector General (IG) for the Department of Transportation
initiated an audit of Coast Guard oversight of Great Lakes pilotage. The final report of the audit (Audit of the U.S.
Coast Guard's Oversight and Management of the Great Lakes Pilotage Program), detailing further issues affecting
the basis for Great Lakes pilotage rates, was issued on December 14, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 2, 1991, a DOT Task Force was formed to: (1) Develop an interim rate adjustment; and (2) establish a new pilotage
ratemaking methodology. On June 5, 1992, an interim rate increase was published (CGD 89&hyph;104). This rate adjustment
was designed to increase the revenue received by the pilots, pending development of a permanent rate methodology.

Discussion of Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This NPRM proposes a new methodology for setting pilotage rates on the Great Lakes. This NPRM would replace the general
guidelines of the existing methodology, set forth in 46 CFR Part 404, with more detailed and specific steps to be followed
when setting Great Lakes Pilotage rates. It would also make correlative changes to the accounting and reporting requirements
set forth in 46 CFR part 403. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM would not change the current Great Lakes pilotage rates and charges contained in 46 CFR 401.400&hyph;401.428.
This NPRM proposes to change the methodology by which those rates would be determined during Great Lakes pilotage
ratemaking proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the proposed ratemaking methodology would provide that the Director of Great Lakes Pilotage (the Director),
determine the timing for reviews of pilotage rates. Interested parties would be able to petition the Director for
a review at any time. However, the Director would decide, under applicable law, if a review is warranted. If the Director
determined that a review is warranted, he or she would accomplish this review by following the steps detailed in this
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basically, these steps involve the projection of operating expenses (including pilot compensation) and revenues
(using the current rate schedule), based on the anticipated demand for pilotage services, by pilotage area for the
succeeding navigation period. Interest expense on the debt of the pilot organizations, and allowances for federal
income taxes and the capital invested in the pilot organizations would be subtracted from this projected operating
profit or loss. Ideally, projected revenues received under the existing rate schedule would be sufficient to cover
projected operating expenses, interest, and allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a rate adjustment appeared warranted, the Director would calculate a new hourly rate schedule for basic pilotage
service in each pilotage area by dividing the sum of the projected costs (operating expenses, interest expense, and
tax and return allowances) by the projected hours of pilotage service. The Coast Guard would publish any proposed
rate adjustments in a NPRM inviting comments on the changes. That NPRM, and any subsequent comments on it, would then
form the basis for negotiations on pilotage rates between the United States and Canada. Once these negotiations resulted
in an agreement to change pilotage rates, the Coast Guard would publish a rule establishing a new rate schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also proposes to change the financial reporting requirements for pilot associations to more closely comport
to ratemaking needs. The proposed changes to the reporting requirements, while an integral part of the ratemaking
process, should be considered independently from any proposed ratemaking provisions. This NPRM also proposes to
add a certification requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposals contained in the discussion section of this preamble are presented in two parts. Part A of this section
discusses proposed revisions to the ratemaking methodology. Part B addresses proposed revisions to the financial
reporting requirements. The order of discussion in this preamble differs from the order of presentation in the regulations.
The revisions to the ratemaking methodology are discussed first because an understanding of the methodology is important
to an understanding of the proposed changes to the financial reporting requirements, and because the changes to the
proposed methodology are more extensive than the changes to the financial reporting requirements.

Adoption of Public Service Rate Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Pilotage Act (46 U.S.C. 9303) provides, in part, that the rates and charges for pilotage services shall be fair
and equitable, giving due consideration to the public interest and the reasonable cost and expense of providing and
maintaining such facilities and arrangements as are required for the efficient performance of pilotage services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the provision of service by the pilot organizations contains many of the characteristics and requirements
of a public utility, this NPRM proposes to employ basic utility ratemaking procedures in setting pilotage rates and
charges. Basic utility ratemaking concepts include the non-discriminatory treatment of users, operational and
economic efficiency through the use of ratemaking standards, and other general public policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM describes the general financial structure of public service rates and proposes to apply this structure
to the three U.S. pilot organizations providing pilotage services on the Great Lakes, with several economic standards
applied to cost elements and specific application and designation of revenue categories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This NPRM defines the elements of this basic structure for Great Lakes Pilotage Rates below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Adjusted Operating Revenue: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adjusted Operating Revenue is the sum of all operating revenues received by the pilot organizations for their pilotage
services, less revenues from ancillary pilotage services that are offset against operating expenses, discussed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjusted Operating Expense: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adjusted Operating Expense is the sum of all operating expenses incurred by the pilot organizations for their pilotage
services, less the sum of all disallowed expenses, discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjusted Operating Profit (Loss): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adjusted Operating Profit (Loss) is the Adjusted Operating Revenue, less the Adjusted Operating Expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjusted Interest Expense: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adjusted Interest Expense is the reported pilot association interest expense on operations, adjusted to exclude
any interest expense attributable to non-pilotage operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjusted Earnings Before Tax: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adjusted Earnings Before Tax is the Adjusted Operating Profit (Loss), less the Adjusted Interest Expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Tax Allowance: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Tax Allowance is the Federal statutory tax on Earnings Before Tax, for those pilot organizations subject
to federal tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adjusted Net Income: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adjusted Net Income is the Adjusted Earnings Before Tax, less the Federal Tax Allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Return Element: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Return Element is the Adjusted Net Income, plus Adjusted Interest Expense. The return element can be considered
the sum of the return to equity capital (the net income) and the return to debt (the interest expense). Both interest
expense and net income must be summed to determine the return to the combined debt and equity investment, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Investment Base: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Investment Base is the net capital invested in the pilot organization, including both equity and debt. Should
capital be invested in other than pilotage operations, that capital and related revenues and expenses would be excluded
from the rate base. The investment base is defined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Return on Investment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Return on Investment (ROI) is the Return Element, divided by the Investment Base, and expressed as a percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Putting actual data into the format described above would generate the pilot organizations' actual financial performance
for a past period. This NPRM proposes to establish prospective rates, however, and therefore propose several additional
regulatory adjustments. These adjustments include establishing a prospective return to investment, adjusting
for inflation, and projecting the need for pilotage services. These adjustments are described in Part A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Investment Base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Investment Base is the recognized capital investment in the useful assets employed by the pilot groups. In general,
it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets, less the value of land. This NPRM proposes to establish
the investment base through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material supplied in the Notes to the
Financial Statement, discussed below. Below are the accounts and methodology this NPRM proposes to use. The account
numbers are taken from the accounting revisions in Part B.

Part A: Proposed Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In summary, the basic steps to be followed in the proposed Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology would be as
follows: (1) Projection of operating expenses, including target pilot compensation; (2) projection of operating
revenues at current rates, including revenues from ancillary services; (3) calculation of investment base; (4)
determination of target rate of return on investment; (5) substitution of data into the basic utility rate structure;
and (6) adjustment of the basic pilotage rate schedule if necessary, subject to the requirements of the Memorandum
of Arrangements between the United States and Canada. The details of each of these steps can be found in Appendix A of
the proposed amendments to 46 CFR part 404.

General Ratemaking Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Director would continue to determine, under applicable law, when reviews of Great Lakes pilotage rates would
be conducted. In addition, this NPRM proposes to allow an interested party or parties to petition the Director for
a review, provided that sufficient justification is included in the request. This would allow the Director to react
to changing circumstances which might affect pilotage rates. The Coast Guard invites comment on whether rate reviews
should be conducted at fixed intervals, and if so, what the timing of the intervals should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes that each of the seven U.S. pilotage areas be treated as separate cost centers for ratemaking calculations.
This is because each area consists of either designated or undesignated waters, and the target pilot compensation
would be different for each.

Part A.1. Derivation of Return on Investment and Adjustment for Inflation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Return on Investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The proposed rate schedule, based on average costs per pilotage hour as developed below, are in part determined by
the permitted rate of return on investment (ROI). This is calculated by dividing the sum of return to debt (interest
expense) and the return to equity (net income), by the investment base. Revenues received must be sufficiently high
to create sufficient net income, when added to interest expense and the sum divided by the investment base, to equal
the allowed rate of return on investment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ROI for any industry can vary significantly depending solely on the mix of debt to equity capital. Many public service
ratemaking authorities determine the allowable ROI using an artificial debt/equity ratio. This is generally done
to encourage equity capital investment in an industry, since the return to equity is generally set higher than the
return to debt. Since such a mechanism is neither feasible nor necessary in the case of pilotage services, this NPRM
does not propose to establish any ROI standard based on a specified debt/equity ratio, but would accept the debt/equity
ratio of each of the pilot organizations as reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to set the allowed rate of return to equity capital at the most recent return on stockholder's equity
for a representative cross-section of transportation industry companies, including maritime companies, with
a minimum rate equal to the interest rate incurred by the associations for debt capital, and a maximum rate of 20.0 percent.
Alternate proposed rate of return to capital percentages should contain reasonable support for their selection
over this NPRM's proposal. For example, under this NPRM's proposed methodology, the computed ROI standard for pilotage
rates, assuming a 50/50 debt/equity ratio, an implicit interest rate of 14 percent on debt capital and a 20 percent
return to equity capital, would be 17.0 percent (.50 times .14, plus .50 times .20 = .170, or 17.0 percent.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The average hourly charge for pilotage services would be set to generate sufficient revenues to cover operating expense
and the return on investment allowance (including Federal taxes, if any). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Adjustment for Inflation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This NPRM proposes to project annual inflation factors to the succeeding navigation season, reflecting the gradual
increase in cost throughout the season. These inflation factors would be applied to the actual costs of the pilot organizations,
other than for pilot compensation, in computing the rate necessary to achieve the target ROI. The factors would not
be applied to pilot compensation costs, which are estimated separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to project the actual annual experienced changes in the average costs per pilot assignment for
each pilotage area after the initial two years of cost inflation under this NPRM's proposed rate methodology. The
initial two years of cost adjustment would be based on the preceding year's change in the North Central Region's Consumer
Price Index, as calculated by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Costs not subject to inflation (depreciation,
for example) would not be adjusted for this initial period. Alternate methods of cost projection proposed during
the comment period of this rule would be carefully considered.

Part A.2. Recognition of Costs for Ratemaking Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Virtually all regulated rates contain economic incentives, penalties, or limits. This NPRM has already mentioned
one such standard sometimes used, an artificial debt/equity ratio for return on investment. This NPRM proposes one
explicit economic standard for Great Lakes pilotage ratemakings_recognition of lease expenses only to the extent
that they either: (a) Approximate open market costs (for those leased assets with readily available markets); or
(b) approximate ownership cost (for those leased assets with limited alternative markets, or which were obtained
through transaction with affiliated companies.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also proposes to place expenses that appear excessive under greater scrutiny than in the past. Regulators
may disallow expenses, subject to appeal by the pilot associations, as excessive or unrelated to the provision of
pilotage services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, while the Coast Guard is unaware of the use of other than the straight-line method of recording depreciation
expense by the pilot organizations, this NPRM does not propose to recognize, for rate-setting purposes, depreciation
expenses on other than a straight-line basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
Recognition of Lease Expenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Economic organizations lease equipment or other assets for a number of operational or financial reasons. This NPRM
proposes no general objection to the leasing of assets. However, lease transactions, and lease transactions with
related companies in particular, are subject to two general guidelines in public ratesetting. The first guideline
allows recognition of lease expense with no adjustment should the lease terms generally approximate the market conditions
for the leased asset. The second guideline allows the recognition of lease expenses only to the extent that the lease
cost approximates the cost of owning the asset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to recognize lease costs to the extent that they generally approximates open market costs, subject
to the condition that a readily available alternative supplier for the leased asset exists. Should there be no readily
available alternate supplier, recognition of lease costs would be limited to the approximate cost of ownership,
including a return to capital. Since related-party transactions by definition are not open market transactions,
this NPRM proposes to generally apply the more stringent guideline to all related-party transactions. (See 14 CFR
399.43, for example). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to amend the financial reporting requirements to require that lease costs be recorded in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) publication FASB&hyph;13, including subsequent rulings
on this subject by the FASB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Part A.3. Ancillary Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Several charges have traditionally been levied for ancillary pilotage services, such as docking/undocking and
moving to an anchorage, as well as penalty charges, such as for delay or cancellation. Revenues received for these
services have been included as part of the overall revenues received by the pilot organizations in estimating the
need for rate changes. However, accepting these revenues as general revenues does not tie the revenues received to
the provision of a service or the incursion of a cost. For example, overhead costs (non-pilot compensation costs)
are incurred in assigning a pilot. Should that order be later cancelled, the revenue received from the cancellation
charge is reported as cancellation charge revenue, but is not linked to the overhead cost of assigning the pilot.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This NPRM proposes to link revenues received for ancillary services to the cost of services provided through the use
of revenue offset methodology. Under this method, revenues received from charges for ancillary services are ``offset''
against the direct expenses of providing that service. In the above example, overhead costs would be reduced by the
revenues received for the cancellation charge, other costs (pilot compensation costs for example) would be unaffected.
The total amount of revenue received (needed) or expenses recognized under revenue offset methodology is unchanged.
However, as discussed below, this NPRM proposes to set the charges for ancillary services separately from the basic
pilotage rates in this NPRM. In addition, this NPRM also proposes to equalize ancillary charges between districts.
For equity, as well as for economic reasons, a docking charge at Duluth should be equal to one at Chicago, Detroit, or
Buffalo. This NPRM will discuss these charges in turn.

Docking/Undocking and Harbor Movement Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The current docking/undocking charges in undesignated waters are $297, $256, and $271, for Districts 1 through 3,
respectively. Districts 1 and 3 also have a direct charge for a moveage in a harbor, at $580 and $531, respectively.
For comparability, during the next ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the docking/undocking charge
at the same level for all three districts (e.g. at $250), subject to supported comment for establishment at any other
level, or for differentiation between districts. This NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation,
but may change the level of the charge from time to time upon review of the Director. In similar fashion, during the next
ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the charge for moveage in a harbor for all three districts at twice the
docking charge, (e.g. $500), under the presumption that a moveage requires both an undocking (or lifting anchor)
and a docking (anchorage). This adjustment is again subject to supported comment as to level and applicability. Again,
this NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge from time to time
upon review of the Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue received for docking/undocking and moveage within a harbor would be offset against revenues required for
pilot compensation.

Delay Charges

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Delay charges, per hour, whether for trip interruption or departure or moveage delays, would be set at the rate determined
in the pilot compensation phase, below, as adjusted for ship size. The maximum basic rate for any 24 hour period would
be the per hour delay charge, as adjusted for ship size, times 16 hours. Delay charges would not be imposed for interruption
caused by ice, weather, or traffic (except from December 1 through April 8 of each year), and would also not be imposed
in undesignated waters if a trip, though delayed, is still completed within the minimum 6 hour period under 401.410(a).
Revenues received for delay charges would be offset against revenues required for pilot compensation.

Cancellation Charges

If a pilot reports for duty and the order is cancelled, the ship would pay the minimum basic pilot compensation charge
for a six-hour period, unadjusted for ship size; if the order is cancelled, and the pilot has started travel but not
arrived, the minimum charge would also apply. If the cancellation is more than six hours after the pilot reports to
the designated boarding point, the ship would pay the minimum basic pilot compensation charge for six-hour period,
plus delay charges for each hour or fraction of an hour over six hours, subject to the maximum basic rate for delay charges
(the delay charge per hour times 16 hours for any 24 hour period.) Revenues received for cancellation charges would
be offset against operating expenses.

As for docking/undocking and moveage, this NPRM proposes that the fee for lock passage should be the same for all three

for all three districts (e.g. $150), subject to supported comment for establishment at any other level, or for differentiation
between districts. This NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge
from time to time upon review of the Director. Revenues received for lock passage charges would be offset against revenues
required for pilot compensation.

Part A.4. Development and Application of Hourly Pilotage Charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The operating expenses recognized under this NPRM's proposed methodology are broken into two major components,
pilot compensation costs and non-pilot operating costs. The projected non-pilot operating costs for the ensuing
navigation season, including the constructed amount necessary to bring the pilot organizations to the ROI standard,
would be divided by the sum of the estimated pilotage hours for both designated and undesignated waters, by District.
This standard charge per hour would be applied on a per hour basis for each supplied pilotage hour, whether in designated
or undesignated waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total pilot compensation costs for designated and undesignated waters are derived from the target pilot compensation
for masters and first mates, times the number of needed pilots. The pilot compensation cost per hour for designated
and undesignated waters is this constructed cost, divided by the pilot hours projected in designated or undesignated
waters. Target pilot compensation and the number of needed pilots is developed below.

The sum of non-pilot operating costs per hour and pilot compensation costs per hour (for designated and undesignated
waters separately) is the total cost per hour to be charged for pilotage services.

Target Pilot Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Coast Guard and Department policy is to maintain income comparability between pilots providing international
regulated pilot services and private masters and first mates operating domestic vessels on the Great Lakes with similar
responsibilities. This NPRM proposes to continue the current income comparability policy of using as target compensation
for pilots in undesignated waters the compensation of first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. Target compensation
for pilots providing service in designated waters would continue to be comparable to masters on Great Lakes vessels,
but this NPRM proposes to set the target at 150% of the compensation of first mates, rather than attempting to determine
the actual average compensation of Great Lakes masters. While the Coast Guard would periodically review this estimate,
available data indicate that this average premium has remained reasonably stable, is relatively simple to administer,
and avoids costly sampling of individual master's contracts, which are not publicly available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM lists below those items proposed to be included as part of the pilot compensation portion of the rate schedule.
Line items here included would be removed from the cost pools included in direct operating expenses to preclude double
counting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This NPRM proposes to exclude profit sharing as a component of pilot compensation expense, since this is a voluntary
contribution by the employer paid from profits, similar in form to the return element proposed to be paid the pilot
organizations (which may be distributed as a bonus). Profit sharing expense, which may have been included in past
rate-setting as an expense item in the pilot associations expense accounts, would be disallowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to add a F.I.C.A. allowance and a workmen's compensation allowance to pilot compensation to ensure
comparability between pilot groups, and to properly reflect the allocated cost of pilot services. Allowances listed
here would be transferred from general pilot association costs (if included there), or added to the cost pools (if
not currently included in general association costs). This NPRM proposes to require these costs to be separately
identified and reported in either the financial statement or by special report (See Part B).

Number of Required Pilots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Coast Guard and Department policies have set the minimum number of pilots needed by establishing specific minimum
annual pilot hours for designated and undesignated waters (1,000 and 1,800 hours per pilot, respectively) for a pilot
to receive comparable compensation discussed above. The required number of pilots for any succeeding navigation
season was determined by dividing a projection of the number of pilot hours required in designated and undesignated
waters, by District, by the minimum standard annual pilot hours. This required number of pilots, for both designated
and undesignated services and individually rounded upward, was then multiplied by the target income per pilot (above)
to determine the revenue necessary under the rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to continue this policy and methodology in determining the number of pilots and the necessary pilot
comparability income to be included in the rate schedule.

The target pilot compensation, by District and by designated (Master) and undesignated (First Mate) compensation,
would then be divided by the estimated pilotage hours in designated or undesignated waters to construct an average
hourly cost per hour for pilot compensation in designated or undesignated waters.

Pilot compensation charges per hour, for designated and undesignated waters separately, would be added to the average
cost for non-pilot compensation expenses per hour. The sum of these average costs, for designated and undesignated
waters separately, would be the average cost per pilotage hour to be recovered under the rate, subject to the adjustment
for vessel size, below.

Part A.5. Adjustment of Pilotage Charges for Vessel Size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
It is accepted belief and practice that pilotage of larger vessels deserves a higher level of compensation than that
for smaller vessels. The current rate schedule uses a vessel size multiplier to increase the charge for larger vessels,
and, presumably, the pilot compensation. (46 CFR 401.400) Also, maintaining shipping in the Great Lakes is a public
benefit and goal, and is supported by government agencies. As smaller ships carry less cargo and are more affected
by pilotage cost on a per-ton basis, a differential in cost (or lesser increase) is likely to encourage the continuation
of their service.

Based on this perceived public interest, this NPRM proposes to continue to use these vessel-size rate multipliers
for the proposed rates for all three districts. However, the average base rate derived above must be adjusted for such
multiplication, since the average base rate is an unweighted charge. This NPRM proposes to adjust the base rate to
reflect a ship weighting factor of 1.0 by dividing the average base rate by the average ship weighting factor derived
from pilot billings. For 1990 the average weighted ship sailing, for designated and undesignated waters was as follows:

This NPRM proposes to adjust the hourly charge for pilot services by dividing the average total pilotage charge by
the average vessel weighting factor for the preceding year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For illustrative purposes only, this adjustment to the pilotage charge per hour is shown below. (In the example, the
hourly rates are derived from the interim rate increase published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 5, 1992 (CGD 89&hyph;104) to calculate charges on an hourly basis.) For District 1, Area 1, ship factor 1.0 would
equal the average cost per hour of $166, divided by the average ship weighting factor of 1.269, or $131. Ship factor
1.3 would be $131 times 1.3, or $170. For ease of calculation this NPRM proposes to continue to use hourly rates rounded
to the nearest dollar.

Part A.6. Application of the Pilotage Charges to Vessel Trips 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The required pilotage charges per pilot hour are determined above. Most trips and sailings, however, are provided
between relatively few points, in part due to pilot changeover, and in part due to ship movements involving mostly
the larger trading ports. For simplicity and operational efficiency, this NPRM proposes to fix the pilotage charges
for selected sailings and trips, based upon average transit time as reported in pilot source forms. This NPRM proposes
that the average time for sailings served more than ten times per year in each direction would adequately define the
necessary pilot time for these repeated sailings, exclusive of delay and demurrage. This NPRM proposes to multiply
the average time for these repeated sailings by the adjusted pilotage charge for Ship Factor 1 to construct a base charge
for these sailings. These base charges would be published in matrix form, by district. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to base the pilotage charges for sailings to less-served points upon the actual time spent in pilotage
(subject to minimum and incremental hourly charges, below), multiplied by the adjusted pilotage charge per hour.
Charges listed in matrix form and computed time-based charges would be subject to the vessel-size multiplier, as
in the current rate schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also proposes, for less-served points, to continue a minimum six-hour pilotage charge, but with additional
charges added in three hour increments. This NPRM's proposal to use three hour increments represents a reduction
from the six hour increments in the current rate schedule, to more closely match the services performed.

Summary of Changes to Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated in Part A, several changes are proposed to the accounting regulations and reporting requirements under
the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations. In order to facilitate ratemaking, this NPRM proposes to require more detailed
financial reporting from each pilot association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes that each pilot association report financial data in a standard format prescribed by the Director,
and that financial statements of each association be signed by an officer of that association to verify accuracy.
In addition, 46 CFR part 403 would be renumbered and reorganized to bring this part into conformance with current regulatory
guidelines on the numbering and organization of regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes that the general ledger account numbers in part 403 be expanded from four digits to five digits,
and placed in Appendices A and B to part 403. This proposed change would allow greater flexibility in making future
changes to the system of accounts. In addition, the definitions of profit and loss accounts currently found in 46 CFR
403.9 would be deleted because this section does not add any significant information to the uniform accounting system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes that the straight line depreciation method would be consistently used by all pilotage associations.
Using this method would evenly allocate the acquisition costs over the useful life of assets subject to depreciation.
It would also minimize the annual fluctuation of operating expenses and their effect over the ratemaking calculations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes that the recording of lease costs be guided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
publication FASB&hyph;13 and subsequent pronouncements on this subject by the FASB. This proposed change would
differentiate capital leases from operating leases, updating the Great Lakes pilotage accounting standards in
conformance with current accounting practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulations (46 CFR part 403), all pilot associations maintain the same general system of accounts.
However, no two associations currently report financial information in the same format, leading to inconsistencies
between associations. This NPRM proposes an adjustment to the system of accounts. This change would facilitate ratemaking
calculations, and would put pilot associations on a comparable footing for ratemaking calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporations are required by law to pay certain expenses (e.g., Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) and Workmen's
Compensation). However, for unincorporated associations, these expenses are paid by the individual members, and
are not shown on the association's financial statement. If these expenses are not considered in the ratemaking calculations
for unincorporated associations, a lower level of compensation for those pilots would be shown, as compared to compensation
for their counterparts in associations organized as corporations. This NPRM proposes that each unincorporated
pilot association report this financial information, now separately reported, in notes to the association's financial
statement. Only reported items would be considered in ratemaking calculations for all pilot associations. The Director
would not impute such items. This change would put pilot associations with different organizations on a comparable
footing for ratemaking calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to require that financial information which is currently reported on a quarterly basis be reported
on a semiannual basis, and to update the address for the Director. This proposed change to the financial reporting
requirements would ease the burden on pilot associations, without affecting the ratemaking process or oversight
of the pilot associations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This NPRM proposes that profit and loss accounts be reported semiannually in accordance with the charter of accounts
proposed in Appendix B to part 403. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes standardized reporting, by account number, for financial data now submitted in summarized, unnumbered
fashion. The proposed revisions and additions to the reporting requirements are necessary to examine selected costs
for reasonableness (lease and interest costs, etc.); to specifically list expenses that would be included in pilot
compensation costs (e.g., pension and health costs, etc.); and to provide identification for costs not currently
listed as incurred in some districts (e.g., pilot insurance, FICA, retirement). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ratemaking purposes, more detailed information is needed than that supplied in the current financial statements
to determine the reasonableness of capital lease agreements and the depreciable lives and residual value of selected
assets. This NPRM proposes that all matters which may materially influence interpretations or conclusions drawn
from the financial statements of pilot associations with regard to the financial condition or earnings position
of the association would have to be clearly and completely stated as footnotes to the financial statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM proposes to continue the requirement that all financial records, including information on lease transactions,
be maintained and be readily available to the Director's auditors for 10 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM does not propose any significant changes to the form of Inter-Association Settlement Statements. However,
comments on whether it is necessary to retain this section, or any other suggested changes, are specifically requested.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, and significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard considers
this proposed regulation to be significant because a rulemaking affecting the setting of pilotage rates is controversial
and of significant interest to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of this rulemaking is to standardize the financial reporting of Great Lakes pilot associations
and to clarify the methodology to be used in future ratemakings. The methodology proposed is expected to have a minimal
impact on pilotage rates. Since the effect of the rulemaking on pilotage rates is expected to be minimal, a full Regulatory
Evaluation is unnecessary.

), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because this proposal does not affect the overall level of pilotage rates, this proposal
should have little or no impact on small entities which pay pilotage rates, or receive income from pilotage rates.
Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this
proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Title: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Great Lakes Pilotage Rate Methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Need for Information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information is necessary for ratemaking calculations and for the proper financial oversight of the Great Lakes
pilot associations. However, pilot associations currently report financial information as required by 46 CFR part
403. This proposal merely amends the existing reporting requirements by separating several existing summary accounts
into their individual components, and requiring that the financial reporting of all accounts be done in a standardized
format. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Use of Information: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reported data would be used in Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking calculations, and for the proper financial oversight
of the Great Lakes pilot associations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Frequency of Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Balance Sheet, and the Profit and Loss Statement, which are currently required quarterly, would be required semiannually.
Revenue and Traffic Statements would be required monthly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Estimate:

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposed rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612 and has determined that this proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Under 49 CFR 1.46(a) the Secretary delegates to the Commandant of the
Coast Guard the authority to carry out the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960, as amended, except the authority to enter
into, revise, or amend arrangements with Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since vessel traffic in the Great Lakes tends to move between U.S. ports in the national marketplace,
pilotage regulations for the Great Lakes is a matter for which regulations should be of national scope to avoid unreasonably
burdensome variances. State action addressing the same subject matter is preempted by 46 U.S.C. 9306, which provides
that a State or political subdivision of a State may not regulate or impose any requirement on pilotage on the Great
Lakes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this NPRM and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The rule
is procedural in nature because it deals exclusively with ratemaking and accounting procedures. Therefore, this
is included in the categorical exclusion in subsection 2.B.2.1_Administrative actions or procedural regulations
and policies which clearly do not have any environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available
in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under

with the system of accounts prescribed in Appendices A, B and C of this part. These financial records shall be prepared
in accordance with the guidelines of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) issued by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). These guidelines are available by writing to the Director, Great Lakes Pilotage
at the address listed in &sect;401.110(a)(9) of this chapter. The Director reserves the right, however, to expand

interest. Each request for waiver must expressly demonstrate that: existing peculiarities or unusual circumstances
warrant a departure from a required procedure or technique prescribed herein; a specifically defined alternative
procedure or technique will result in a substantially equivalent or more accurate portrayal of operating results
or financial condition, consistent with the principles embodied in this part; and the application of such alternative
procedure will maintain or improve uniformity in substantive results between Associations.

(b) Under the Uniform System of Accounts, both balance sheet and profit and loss accounts and account groupings are
designed, in general, to embrace all activities, both pool and nonpool, in which the Association engages. Except
for transactions which are of sufficient magnitude to distort current year operating results, prior year transactions

(c) In order to afford each Association flexibility to establish ledger and subsidiary accounts to meet its individual
needs, a minimum number of accounts are prescribed in the Uniform System of Accounts. Each Association, in maintaining
its accounting records, must use the prescribed chart of accounts. If additional accounts are necessary, the new
accounts must be consistent with the prescribed chart of accounts classification.

(a) Each Association subject to this part shall maintain its accounts on a calendar year basis unless otherwise approved
by the Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each Association shall keep its financial accounts and records on a full accrual basis. All transactions, as nearly
as may reasonably be ascertained, shall be reflected in the Association's books for the accounting period, matching
revenues earned with the costs attaching thereto.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Charges shall be made against income and accruals made for only those liabilities for which a definitely demonstrable
obligation exists. Where a definite obligation has been incurred and the precise liability has not been determined,
an estimate may be made of the currently existing liability on such actuarial or other bases as can be justified from
available information, provided that balances are reevaluated and adjusted at least once each accounting year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) All income taxes shall be accrued by proportionate charges or credits to income each accounting period in such
manner as will allocate the charges for taxes, or the tax credits for losses, to the periods in which the related profits
or losses respectively, are reflected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The accrual of income taxes for each accounting period requires that each Association take up in its accounts an
amount equivalent to the actual tax liability applicable to the period as computed or estimated on the basis of income
tax laws and regulations then in effect, except where the Association computes depreciation for tax purposes at rates
which differ from straight-line depreciation based upon the estimated life of the asset. In all cases, regardless
of the amount of depreciation which is reported to Federal, State, and local tax authorities for tax purposes, each
Associations' financial reports to the Director shall reflect adjustment of cost to reflect straight-line depreciation.

in cash or sold or consumed within one year, including but not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Unrestricted cash; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) Investments and special funds.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 (1) All investments of the Association in land and units of tangible property and equipment shall be included within
this general classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The property and equipment records shall be maintained so as to identify property with each pool operation, with
nonpool operations, and joint pool or nonpool operations. Property used by two or more pools or nonpool operations
will be maintained to permit an equitable proration of depreciation, amortization, and repair and maintenance cost.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Operating and nonoperating property and equipment shall be accounted for separately as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Investment in property and equipment shall be recorded at total cost including all expenditures applicable to

(B) Charge the depreciation and maintenance reserves with the related reserve balance applicable to the property
disposed of; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Charge the cash proceeds of the sale or the value of salvaged material to the appropriate asset accounts; and

depreciation and maintenance reserves, the difference shall be recorded in the appropriate capital gain or loss
accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Upon disposal by sale, retirement, abandonment, dismantling, or otherwise, of equipment depreciated on a
group basis, the Association shall credit the account in which the property or equipment is carried, and charge the
related depreciation reserve with the original cost thereof, less any salvage realized, regardless of the age of
the item. No gain or loss is recognized on the retirement of individual items of property or equipment depreciated
on a group basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) When property or equipment owned by the Association is applied as part payment of the purchase price of new property
or equipment, the new property or equipment shall be recorded at its full purchase price, provided an excessive allowance

The difference between the depreciated cost of assets applied as payment and the amount allowed therefor shall be
treated as retirement gain or loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Association shall maintain property and equipment records setting forth the description of all property
and equipment recorded in balance sheet classification 12000&hyph;13000, Property and Equipment. With respect

established to record current and cumulative cost expiration of assets being depreciated due to wear and tear from
use and the action of time and the elements which are not replaced by current repairs; as well as losses in capacity for
use or service occasioned by obsolescence, supersession, discoveries, change in popular demand, or the requirement
of public authority. Residual values and rates for accrual of depreciation and maintenance shall be calculated using
the straight-line depreciation method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Depreciation shall be calculated from the date on which a building, structure or unit of property is placed in service,
and shall cease on the date such property is disposed of by sale, retirement, abandonment, or dismantling, or when

is reasonably expected to require the use, within one year, of existing resources of a type which are properly classifiable
as current assets, or the creation of other current liabilities. Current liabilities shall include payables incurred
in the acquisition of materials, collections received in advance of performance of services, debts accruing from
expenses incurred from operations, and other liabilities that are regularly and ordinarily subject to current liquidation.

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all debts or obligations for which liquidation or payment
is not reasonably expected to require the use, within one year, of existing resources of a type which are properly classifiable
as current assets, or the creation of current liabilities. Noncurrent liabilities include mortgages, bonds and
debentures maturing more than one year from the date of the balance sheet, or other obligations not payable within
12 months. This classification shall reflect the principal amount or par value of debt securities issued or other
long-term debt assumed by the Association. Discount and expenses on long-term debt shall be recorded in the Deferred
Charges balance sheet group. Premiums on long-term debt shall be recorded in the Deferred Credits balance sheet account
group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In cases where debt coming due within 12 months is to be refunded, or where payment is to be made from assets of a type
not properly classifiable as current, the amount payable shall not be removed from this classification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Gains or losses on liquidation of bonds, debentures, or other debt securities of the Association shall be entered
in profit and loss classification 47000 ``Other Income,'' or 69000 ``Miscellaneous.'' Gains and losses or adjustments

 (1) Each Association shall include in this classification all items which record the aggregate interest of Association
members in assets owned by the Association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The general classification ``Stockholder's Equity (Capital)'' shall be subdivided between that portion representing
direct contributions of the members (Paid-In Capital) and that portion representing income retained from operations
of the Association (Retained Earnings).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ``Paid-In Capital'' classification shall be subdivided between membership shares and ``Other Paid-In Capital.''
Membership shares shall include par or stated value of shares issued or the cash value of the consideration actually
received, in cases of shares having no par or stated value. ``Other Paid-In Capital,'' shall include the excess (premium)
or deficiency (discount) of each value of the consideration received from the issue of any shares having par or stated
value, donations by stockholders, adjustments of capital resulting from reorganization or recapitalization,
and gains or losses from reacquisition and resale or retirement of the Association's shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The ``Retained Earnings'' balance sheet classification shall reflect the balance of net profits, income, and
gains of the Association from the date of formation. In cases where a deficit has been absorbed by a reduction of ``Other
Paid-In Capital'' as a result of a restatement of shares or retained earnings, a new Retained Earnings account shall
be established, dated to show that it runs from the effective date of the restatement. This date shall be disclosed
in financial statements until such time as the effective date no longer possesses special significance.

(a) The purpose of this part is to provide guidelines and procedures for Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking. Included
in this part are explanations of the steps followed in developing a pilotage rate adjustment, the analysis used, and
the guidelines followed in arriving at the pilotage rates contained in part 401 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Director determines the timing for reviews of Great Lakes pilotage rates. These reviews are conducted at his
or her discretion and are intended to determine whether existing Great Lakes pilotage rates are fair and reasonable,
or should be adjusted. An interested party or parties may also petition the Director for a review at any time. The petition
must present a reasonable basis for concluding that a review may be warranted. If the Director determines, from the
information contained in the petition, that the existing rates may no longer be reasonable, a full review of the pilotage
rates will be conducted. If the full review shows that pilotage rates are within a reasonable range of their target,
no adjustment to the rates will be initiated.

Guidelines for the recognition of expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The following is a listing of the principal guidelines followed by the Director when determining whether expenses
will be recognized in the ratemaking process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each expense item included in the rate base is evaluated to determine if it is necessary for the provision of pilotage
service, and if so, what dollar amount is reasonable for that expense item. Each Association is responsible for providing
the Director with sufficient information to show the reasonableness of all expense items. The Director will give
the Association the opportunity to defend any expenses which are questioned. However, subject to the terms and conditions
contained in other provisions of this part, expense items which the Director determines are not reasonable and necessary
for the provision of pilotage services will not be recognized for ratemaking purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining reasonableness, each expense item is measured against one or more of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Comparable or similar expenses paid by others in the maritime industry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Comparable or similar expenses paid by other industries, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Lease costs for both operating and capital leases are recognized for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they
conform to market rates. In the absence of a comparable market, lease costs are recognized for ratemaking purposes
to the extent that they conform to depreciation plus an allowance for return on investment (computed as if the asset
had been purchased with equity capital). Lease costs which exceed these standards are not recognized for ratemaking
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment is allowed for the net capital invested in the
Association by its members. Assets subject to return on investment provisions are subject to reasonableness provisions.
If an asset or other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, the return element is not allowed
for ratemaking purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For ratemaking purposes, the revenues and expenses generated from Association transactions which are not directly
related to the provision of pilotage services are included in ratemaking calculations as long as the revenues exceed
the expenses from these transactions. For non-pilotage transactions which result in a net financial loss for the
Association, the amount of the loss is not recognized for ratemaking purposes. The Director reviews non-pilotage
activities to determine if any adversely impact the provision of pilotage service, and may make ratemaking adjustments
or take other steps to ensure the provision of pilotage service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Medical, pension, and other benefits paid to pilots, or for the benefit of pilots, by the Association are treated
as pilot compensation. The amount recognized for each of these benefits is the cost of these benefits in the most recent
union contract for first mates on Great Lakes vessels. Any expenses in excess of this amount are not recognized for
ratemaking purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Expense items which are not reported to the Director by the Association are not considered by the Director in ratemaking
calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Expenses are appropriate and allowable if they are reasonable, and directly related to pilotage. Each Association
must substantiate its expenses, including legal expenses. In general, the following are not recognized as reasonable
expenses for ratemaking purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Undocumented fees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fees for lobbying; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Fees for non-pilotage personal matters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Fees which are not commensurate with the work performed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Any other fees not directly related to pilotage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) In any Great Lakes pilotage district where revenues and expenses from Canadian pilots are commingled with revenues
and expenses from U.S. pilots, Canadian revenues and expenses are not included in the U.S. calculations for setting
pilotage rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Profit sharing expenses are not recognized for ratemaking purposes.

(a) Appendix A to this part is a description of the types of analyses performed and the methodology followed in the development
of Great Lakes pilotage rate adjustments. Ratemaking calculations in Appendix A of this part are made using the definitions
and formulas contained in Appendix B of this part. Pilotage rates actually implemented may vary from the results of
the calculations in Appendices A and B, because of agreements with Canada requiring identical rates, or because of
other circumstances to be determined by the Director. Additional analysis may also be performed as circumstances
require. The guidelines contained in &sect;404.05 are applied in the steps identified in Appendix A to this part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1: Projection of Operating Expenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The first Step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the amount of fair and reasonable
operating expenses that basic pilotage rates should recover, as determined by the Director. This step consists of
the following phases: (a) Submission of financial information from each Association; (b) determination of recognizable
expenses; (c) adjustment for ancillary revenues; (d) adjustment for inflation or deflation; and (e) final projection
of operating expenses. Each of these phases is detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1.A._Submission of Financial Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each Association is responsible for providing detailed financial information to the Director, in accordance
with Part 403 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1.B._Determination of Recognizable Expenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Director determines which Association expenses will be recognized for ratemaking purposes, using the guidelines
for the recognition of expenses contained in &sect;404.05 of this chapter. Each Association is responsible for providing
sufficient data for the Director to make this determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1.C._Adjustment for Ancillary Revenues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Several charges have traditionally been levied for pilotage services which are additional to basic pilotage
service. These charges are termed ``ancillary charges,'' and are defined as charges for docking, undocking, moveage,
delay, cancellation, and lock transit. Revenues received from these ancillary charges will be offset against the
operational expenses of the Associations. Rates for ancillary services will be set separately from basic pilotage
rates. The method for setting ancillary rates is discussed in Step 7.D., below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1.D._Adjustment for Inflation or Deflation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) In making projections of future expenses, expenses that are subject to inflationary or deflationary pressures
are adjusted. Costs not subject to inflation or deflation (e.g., depreciation, long-term leases, pilot compensation,
etc.) are not adjusted. The inclusion of an inflation or deflation adjustment does not imply that pilotage rates will
be automatically adjusted each shipping season, without a pilotage rate review. The inflation or deflation adjustment
is only made during the expense projection phase of a full-scale pilotage rate review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual cost inflation or deflation rates will be projected to the succeeding navigation season, reflecting the gradual
increase or decrease in cost throughout the year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ratemaking calculations begun after January 1, 1996, the actual annual experienced change in the average cost
in non-pilot operational costs per pilot assignment for each pilotage area will be used to project the inflation or
deflation adjustment. For ratemaking calculations begun prior to January 1, 1996, the inflation or deflation adjustment
will be based on the preceding year's change in the North Central Region's Consumer Price Index as calculated by the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 1.E._Projection of Operating Expenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Once all adjustments are made to the recognized operating expenses, the Director projects these expenses for
each pilotage district. In doing so, the Director takes into account foreseeable circumstances which could affect
the accuracy of the projection. The Director will determine, as accurately as reasonably practicable, the ``projection
of operating expenses.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 2: Projection of Target Pilot Compensation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The second Step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the amount of target pilot compensation
that pilotage rates should provide in each area. This Step consists of the following phases: (a) Determination of
target rate of compensation; (b) determination of number of pilots needed in each pilotage area; and (c) multiplication
of the target compensation by the number of pilots needed to project target pilot compensation needed in each area.
Each of these proposed phases is detailed below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 2.A._Determination of Target Rate of Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in undesignated waters is average annual compensation
for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. The average annual compensation for first mates is determined based on
the most current union contracts, and includes wages and benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Target pilot compensation for pilots providing services in designated waters approximates the average annual
compensation for masters on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. It is calculated as 150% of the compensation earned by first
mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 2.B._Determination of Number of Pilots Needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of designated waters is established by dividing the projected
bridge hours for that area by 1,000. Bridge hours are the number of hours a pilot is aboard a vessel providing basic pilotage
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The basis for the number of pilots needed in each area of undesignated waters is established by dividing the projected
bridge hours for that area by 1,800. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining the number of pilots needed in each pilotage area, the Director is guided by the results of the calculations
in steps 2.A. and 2.B. However, the Director may also find it necessary to make adjustments to these numbers in order
to ensure uninterrupted pilotage service in each area, or for other reasonable circumstances which the Director
determines are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 2.C._Projection of Target Pilot Compensation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The ``projection of target pilot compensation'' is determined separately for each pilotage area by multiplying
the number of pilots needed in that area by the target pilot compensation for pilots working in that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 3: Projection of Revenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The third step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to project the revenue that would be received
in each pilotage area if existing rates were left unchanged. This step consists of two phases: (a) Projection of future
vessel traffic and pilotage revenue; and (b) adjustment for ancillary revenues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 3.A._Projection of Revenue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Director generates the most accurate projections reasonably possible of the pilotage service that will be
required by vessel traffic in each pilotage area. These projections are based on historical data and all other relevant
data available. Projected demand for pilotage service is multiplied by the existing pilotage rates for that service,
to arrive at the projection of all pilotage revenue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 3.B._Adjustment for Ancillary Revenues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The projection of pilotage revenue from Step 3.A., above, is adjusted for ancillary revenues (i.e., revenue from
docking, undocking, moveage, delay, cancellation, and lock transit). Ancillary revenues are subtracted from the
projection of all pilotage revenue because the rates for ancillary services are set separately from the basic pilotage
rates. The method for setting ancillary charges is discussed in Step 7.D., below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After adjustment for ancillary revenues, the result is the projection for revenues which would be generated by
basic pilotage services if existing rates are left unchanged. The results of these calculations is defined as the
``projection of revenue.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 4: Calculation of Investment Base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The fourth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is the calculation of the investment base of
each Association. The investment base is the recognized capital investment in the assets employed by each Association
required to support pilotage operations. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets,
less the value of land. The investment base will be established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended
by material supplied in the Notes to the Financial Statement. The formula used in calculating the investment base
is detailed in Appendix B to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 5: Determination of Target Rate of Return on Investment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The fifth step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to determine the Target Rate of Return on Investment.
For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment (ROI) is allowed for the recognized net capital
invested in the Association by its members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The allowed ROI is based on the rate of the most recent return on stockholder's equity for a representative cross
section of transportation industry companies, including maritime companies, with a minimum rate equal to the interest
rate incurred by the Associations for debt capital, and a maximum rate of 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Assets subject to return on investment provisions must be reasonable in both purpose and amount. If an asset or
other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, that portion of the return element is not
allowed for ratemaking purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 6: Adjustment Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The next step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to insert the results from steps 1, 2, 3, and
4 into a formula which is based on a standard utility rate structure, and comparing the results to step 5. This basic
utility rate structure takes into account revenues, expenses and return on investment, and is of the following form:

(2) The Director will compare the projected return on investment (as calculated using the formula above) to the target
return on investment (from step 5), to determine whether an adjustment to the basic pilotage rates is necessary. If
the projected return on investment is significantly different from the target return on investment, the revenues
which would be generated by the current pilotage rates are not equal to the revenues which would need to be recovered
by the pilotage rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The basic pilotage revenues that are needed are calculated by substituting in a figure for the projected revenue
which will make the target return on investment equal to the projected return on investment. This ``projection of
revenue needed'' is used in determining the basis for proposed adjustments to the basic pilotage rates. The mechanism
for adjusting the basic pilotage rates is discussed in Step 7 below. The required return, tax, and interest elements
may be considered additions to the operating expenses and pilot compensation components of the hourly charge for
basic pilotage service, which is discussed in Step 7.A. below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Step 7: Adjustment of Pilotage Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The final step in the Great Lakes pilotage ratemaking methodology is to adjust Great Lakes pilotage rates if the
calculations from Step 6 show that pilotage rates in a pilotage area should be adjusted, and if the Director determines
that it is appropriate to go forward with a rate adjustment. Rate adjustments are calculated in accordance with the
procedures found in this step. However, pilotage rates calculated in this step are subject to adjustment based on
requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada, and other supportable circumstances
which may be appropriate. Pilotage rate adjustments consist of the following: (a) Calculation of the hourly pilotage
charge; (b) calculation of pilotage charges for unspecified trips; (c) calculation of pilotage charges for specified
trips; (d) calculation of pilotage charges for ancillary services; and (e) adjustment of pilotage charges for vessel
size. Each of these is detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 7.A._Calculation of Hourly Charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Director determines a proposed hourly charge for basic pilotage service in each pilotage area. This hourly
charge is used in the calculation of pilotage rates discussed in Steps 7.B., 7.C., and 7.D., below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed total hourly charge for pilotage service in each pilotage area consists of two components, i.e.,
pilot compensation, and operating expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The pilot compensation component of the hourly charge is derived by dividing the projected target pilot compensation
for each area, by the estimated pilotage hours (i.e., bridge hours) for that area. This calculation results in a pilot
compensation charge for each hour of pilotage service in that pilotage area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The operating expense component of the hourly charge is derived by dividing the projected operating expenses
for each pilotage district, including the constructed amount necessary to bring the Associations to the ROI standard,
by the estimated pilotage hours (bridge hours). This calculation results in an operating expense charge for each
hour of pilotage service in that pilotage district. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The total hourly charge for basic pilotage service in each pilotage area is derived by adding the pilot compensation
charge for that area to the operating expense charge for the district in which that area is located. These calculations
are adjusted for average ship size as discussed in Step 7.E., below.

Step 7.B._Calculation of Charges for Unspecified Trips 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For transits which are not specified in &sect;401.405 and &sect;401.410 of this chapter, the Director bases basic
pilotage rates on the hourly charge developed in Step 7.A., above. This hourly charge for basic pilotage service is
assessed for each hour that a registered pilot is aboard a vessel, subject to a six-hour minimum each time a pilot is
assigned, with three-hour increments thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Step 7.C._Calculation of Charges for Specified Trips 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For transits which are specified in &sect;401.405 and &sect;401.410 of this chapter, the Director periodically
reviews the average time for each individual transit, using the travel time in both directions. This review will be
accomplished at least once every five years. The proposed basic pilotage fee listed for specified transits in &sect;401.405
and &sect;401.410 of this chapter is based on the result of multiplying the hourly basic pilotage fee by the average
transit time calculated for that transit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During ratemaking proceedings which occur between periodic reviews of average vessel transit times, the rates
for specified transits are adjusted as a group. The pilotage rate for specified transits in each area is adjusted by
subtracting the ``projection of revenue'' from the ``projection of revenue needed'' and dividing by the ``projection
of revenue,'' with the resultant deficit or surplus expressed in percentage terms, rounded to the nearest whole number.
The proposed basic pilotage rates for specified transits are determined by multiplying the existing rates by the
resultant percentage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Ancillary charges are equalized between districts. These charges need not be adjusted during every ratemaking.
These charges are reviewed at intervals of not more than five years, during the periodic review of average vessel transit
time for specified trips discussed in Step 7.C., above. Each of these charges is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Docking, Undocking and Harbor Movement Charges_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For consistency, these charges are set at the same level in all districts. The charges are determined by the Director,
subject to the requirements of the Memorandum of Arrangements between the United States and Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Moveage_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The charge for moveage in a harbor for all three districts is twice the docking charge.

(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Delay Charges_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Delay charges, per hour, whether for trip interruption or departure or moveage delays, are set at the rate determined
in the pilot compensation phase discussed in Step 2 above, as adjusted for ship size. The maximum delay charge for any
24-hour period is the per hour delay charge, as adjusted for ship size, times 16 hours.

are not adjusted for ship size. If the cancellation occurs less than six hours after the pilot reports, the maximum
charge is the basic pilot compensation charge for a six-hour period. If the cancellation occurs more than six hours
after the pilot reports, the charge is the basic pilot compensation charge for each hour or fraction of an hour, to a
maximum of 16 hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Operating Expense_means the sum of all operating expenses incurred by the Association for pilotage services,
less the sum of disallowed expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Target Pilot Compensation_means the compensation that pilots are intended to receive for full time employment.
For pilots providing services in undesignated waters, the target pilot compensation is the average annual compensation
for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. For pilots providing services in designated waters, the target pilot
compensation is 150% of the average annual compensation for first mates on U.S. Great Lakes vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Operating Profit/(Loss)_means Operating Revenue less Operating Expense and Target Pilot Compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Interest Expense_means the reported Association interest expense on operations, as adjusted to exclude any
interest expense attributable to losses from non-pilotage operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Earnings Before Tax_means Operating Profit/(Loss), less the Interest Expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Federal Tax Allowance_means the Federal statutory tax on Earnings Before Tax, for those Associations subject
to Federal tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Net Income_means the Earnings Before Tax, less the Federal Tax Allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Return Element (Net Income plus Interest)_means the Net Income, plus Interest Expense. The return element can
be considered the sum of the return to equity capital (the Net Income), and the return to debt (the Interest Expense).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Investment Base (separately determined)_means the net recognized capital invested in the Association, including
both equity and debt. Should capital be invested in other than pilotage operations, that capital is excluded from
the rate base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Return on Investment_means the Return element, divided by the Investment Base, and expressed as a percent.

Investment base formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Regulatory Investment (Investment Base) is the recognized capital investment in the useful assets employed
by the pilot groups. In general, it is the sum of available cash and the net value of real assets, less the value of land.
The investment base is established through the use of the balance sheet accounts, as amended by material supplied
in the Notes to the Financial Statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Investment Base is calculated using data from the Uniform System of Accounts described in part 403, as audited
and approved by the Director. Accounts, listed in the Investment Base formula below, which end in 999 are not separate
accounts, but the summation of the accounts listed in each particular grouping. For instance, account no. 10999 is
not a separate balance sheet account, it is the summation of all individual balance sheet accounts in the 10000 grouping.
The Investment Base would be calculated as follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 10, 1992, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 to establish
a visibility enhancement scheme for large trailers (57 FR 58406). On October 6, 1993, the agency published a response
to petitions for reconsideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that scheme (58 FR 52021).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA) wrote NHTSA on August 25, 1993, asking that the mounting
height specification for side conspicuity treatment be changed to allow a range of heights from 0.4m to 2.1m. It observed
that the agency had proposed a lower mounting height of 0.4m though it had adopted a height of 1.25m. TTMA observed that
Standard No. 108 permits reflex reflectors to be mounted within 0.4m of the ground, which is 34 inches below 1.25m,
and ``it seems reasonable that the upper location be 34 inches above'' 1.25m, i.e., 2.1m. It also observed that the
only vertical surface of some trailers may be at a height even greater than 2.1m. This observation was reiterated in
a petition for reconsideration of the 1.525m maximum adopted on October 6, 1993, and submitted by Terminal Service
Company (``Terminal''). It asked for a mounting height maximum of 2.28m for cargo tanks, expressing its concern ``that
enforcement personnel will not consider a 508mm (20 inches) to 762mm (30 inches) height above the 1525mm (60 inches)
requirement practicable.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time that NHTSA received TTMA's letter, it was evaluating petitions for reconsideration of the final rule mounting
height of ``as close to 1.25m as practicable''. Ultimately, it granted those petitions and, on October 6, 1993, adopted
a revised mounting height of ``as close as practicable to not less than 375mm and not more than 1525mm'' above the road
surface. This amendment effectively granted TTMA's petition to allow a lower mounting height than the one originally
adopted. It also responded in part to TTMA's request for a higher mounting height, by allowing a maximum height of ``as
close as practicable to *&blank;*&blank;* not more than'' 1.525m, although not as high as the 2.1m requested. However,
TTMA presented no rationale other than symmetry to justify an increase in mounting height from 1.52m to 2.1m. The agency
finds this an inadequate basis upon which to grant TTMA's petition for rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Terminal's rationale is based upon a fear that the mounting height chosen by a manufacturer for application of conspicuity
treatment on cargo tanks will be so much higher than 1525mm that the agency will not deem it ``practicable'' and that
Federal Highway Administration inspectors will not understand the practicability exception to the height requirement.
NHTSA understands this view and wishes to assure Terminal that it regards this concern as unfounded. As the agency
has advised many times in the past in its interpretations of the practicability requirements of Standard No. 108,
the determination of what is ``practicable'' is initially to be made by the manufacturer, whose certification of
compliance covers its determinations of practicability. NHTSA will not question a manufacturer's determination
unless it appears clearly erroneous. In this instance, NHTSA interprets the conspicuity mounting height specification
as allowing mounting heights higher than 1525mm if the trailer manufacturer does not find it practicable to place
the conspicuity treatment at or below 1525mm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Terminal's trailer case provides a good example. Since the conspicuity material cannot provide the required brightness
when the trailer is at an angle to traffic unless it is mounted in a nearly vertical plane, practicability dictates
that the material be moved to the height where the trailer provides a suitable, vertical mounting surface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the agency has determined that no regulatory action is required to give the relief which the petitioner seeks,
the petition by Terminal Service Company for reconsideration of the maximum mounting height requirement is denied.

B. Petition Relating to Adoption of Geometric Visibility Specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph S5.7.1.4.2(a) of Standard No. 108 specifies that, at the location chosen for conspicuity treatment, ``the
strip shall not be obscured in whole or in part by other motor vehicle equipment or trailer cargo.'' TTMA asked that
the words ``trailer cargo'' be deleted and that obscuration of the strip be determined ``when viewed within&blank;&blank;
+/^30 degrees horizontally or perpendicular to the sheeting 15m (50 feet) away and at a height of 1.25m.'' In justification
of its petition, it argued that trailer manufacturers should not be responsible for the possible obscuring of sheeting
by cargo, and that ``[t]here is not a similar prohibition of obscuring lamps by cargo in FMVSS 108.'' TTMA supplemented
its August 1993 letter on September 24 with the example of a container chassis whose gooseneck connector to a tractor
trailer is obscured when an intermodal container is secured to it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although paragraph S5.3.1.1 of Standard No. 108 requires that lamps and reflectors be mounted on a vehicle so that
they are visible at the test points specified in the SAE Standards and Recommended Practices, this section does not
apply to conspicuity sheeting because no SAE standards regarding conspicuity sheeting materials are incorporated
in Standard No. 108. Furthermore, it would be undesirable to impose geometric visibility requirements on conspicuity
sheeting or reflectors because the practicability constraints on long strips of conspicuity material and reflectors
used in lieu thereof are different than those on lamps and reflectors. While it is possible to move lamps and reflectors
to locations that achieve geometric visibility, the locations available for conspicuity materials on some trailers,
such as the container chassis, may be too limited to permit optimization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to obscuration of conspicuity materials, NHTSA considers that strips or reflectors are obscured by
cargo or equipment only if they are not visible when viewed perpendicular to the conspicuity material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for obscuration by cargo should not be difficult to foresee. NHTSA considers that trailer manufacturers
are in a reasonable position to anticipate where cargo will be placed in or on their trailers because they have designed
the trailers to accommodate specific cargo types and loading techniques. For example, with respect to the container
chassis cited in TTMA's supplementary letter of September 24, the manufacturer of a container chassis knows that
the gooseneck connector will be obscured when the load is in place, and may apply conspicuity treatment that allows
for the load. Assuming an overall chassis length of 53 feet, the manufacturer is required to mark at least half of that
(26.5 feet) with conspicuity marking. Assuming a gooseneck length of 9 feet, Standard No. 108 thus requires that the
minimum of 26.5 feet of conspicuity material be applied in the 44 feet of trailer length that is behind the gooseneck.
The manufacturer is not prohibited from affixing the material to the gooseneck as well if it chooses, but in such a location
this material is considered surplus and, because it will be obscured when the load is in place, cannot be included in
the manufacturer's 50 percent determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice denies a petition for rulemaking by Metalcore, Ltd., to amend the trailer conspicuity requirements of
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 as they apply to the rear of van trailers. The reason for the denial is
the importance of maintaining a common image of rear conspicuity while ensuring the availability of appropriate
cues to drivers following large trailers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Metalcore Ltd. is a Canadian company that manufactures aftermarket door seals for van trailers. It sells a model which
includes 1/2-inch wide conspicuity tape on the rigid channel which supports the seal. The installed seals create
a conspicuity tape pattern equivalent to outlining each rear van door with 1/2-inch wide conspicuity tape. In response
to the final rule of December 10, 1992, adopting trailer conspicuity requirements (57 FR 58406), Metalcore submitted
a ``petition for reconsideration'' on November 5, 1993, in which it asked for the adoption of an alternative rear conspicuity
treatment in which outlining the doors of a van in 1/2-inch wide white material would replace the 2-inch wide red/white
stripe across the rear of the body and the 2-inch wide white upper corner markings. However, because the petition was
not filed within 30 days of the final rule, it has been considered as a petition for rulemaking in accordance with NHTSA
regulations (49 CFR 553.35). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Metalcore serves the trailer repair industry, and its products are used mainly on older trailers which are not subject
to Federal requirements for conspicuity systems, and, to a lesser extent, on trailers which were equipped upon manufacture
with conspicuity tape. Metalcore anticipates that fleets wishing to add conspicuity material voluntarily to older
trailers will prefer to do so in a way that they can claim meets the standards for new vehicles. The requested amendment
would allow Metalcore to make the sales claim that the use of its door seals would permit trailer owners to retrofit
a conforming conspicuity system using about 12 feet less tape than the minimum 63 feet necessary for compliance on
a typical 45-foot van trailer. The conspicuity rule does not prohibit the use of Metalcore's product as an auxiliary
reflector on any trailer, and the ultimate value to customers of the Metalcore door seal resides in its qualities as
a door seal rather than in the reflective tape attached to it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA considered that two issues to be important in the consideration of this petition for an alternative conspicuity
system. The first issue was whether it is desirable to have any alternatives to the required conspicuity configuration,
and the second issue was the merit of the proposed alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Desirability of Alternative Conspicuity Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice proposing the conspicuity rule (56 FR 63474) presented alternative treatments but made clear the agency's
desire to achieve a common conspicuity configuration. NHTSA said: ``While the agency is proposing two specific configurations
of conspicuity treatment, it *&blank;*&blank;* anticipates that the final rule would specify only one pattern,
and not allow alternative treatments.'' The NPRM specifically asked for comments ``on the desirability of standardizing
to the maximum extent possible the treatment for all trailers,'' and it introduced for comment the possibility of
exempting certain types of trailers if a standard treatment proved impractical for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments to the docket urged a conspicuity system with sufficient flexibility for universal application without
the need for exceptions. The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) study (see 57 FR 58409
et seq.), completed during the comment period, concluded that a conspicuity system using the most universally applicable
elements of alternative 2 of the proposed rule would meet the minimum needs for safety in terms of an unambiguous reflective
image with adequate sight distance and closing speed cues. In the final rule preamble, NHTSA noted that one of the attributes
of alternative 2 was that it ``promoted uniformity of appearance,'' and the agency adopted the modifications recommended
by UMTRI to establish a universal treatment without the need for exceptions for difficult to treat trailers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Van trailers have more surface available for conspicuity treatment than other trailers, but NHTSA did not adopt requirements
that appeared unsuitable for other types of trailers. Part of the value of the uniform conspicuity treatment is that
it is expected to maximize the conspicuity of the least conspicuous trailers, such as platform trailers, by giving
them a familiar night image. While the agency does not discourage the use of auxiliary material on trailers with large
amounts of surface area, it believes that maximizing the number of common elements between trailer treatments aids
in their recognition. NHTSA, therefore, is disinclined to allow alternative conspicuity treatments in general
because the final rule was designed to make them unnecessary. Standard No. 108 specifies a minimum amount of reflective
material to achieve the safety purpose, and at minimum cost.

Attributes of the Metalcore Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Metalcore has suggested the alternative of substituting 1/2-inch wide white reflective tape stripes outlining
the doors of a van trailer for the required 2-inch wide white upper corner stripes and 2-inch wide red/white stripe
across the full width of the trailer near the bottom of the doors. It claims that the alternative projects approximately
the same reflective area as the requirement of Standard No. 108 and that the total light return of the alternative is
greater because only white material would be used. It further claims that its alternative of outlining in white has
been shown to be superior to the requirements of Standard No. 108 by Carlton University's report (Tansley and Petrusic)
to Transport Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tansley and Petrusic discounted the value of the U.S. red/white pattern in connoting a hazard and suggested that detection
distance should be the principal measure of safety in evaluating conspicuity schemes. According to the petitioner,
Tansley and Petrusic predicted a detection distance of 819 m for the white outline treatment recommended by Carlton
University as compared with a predicted detection distance of 450 m for Standard No. 108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the notice responding to petitions for reconsideration on October 6, 1993 (58 FR 52021, at 52023), the agency discussed
its disagreement with the decision sight distance criterion recommended by Carlton University and the reasons for
NHTSA's use of the stopping sight distance criterion recommended by UMTRI. The agency believes that Standard No.
108 is more cost effective than the Carlton University recommendations while providing a detection distance adequate
for safety and superior recognition and hazard awareness cues. Standard No. 108 also addresses the practicability
problems of trailers other than vans that were not considered in the Carlton University recommendations. NHTSA also
notes that in a demonstration test reported by Transport Canada in its Technical Memorandum TME 9301, the detection
distances found for the Carlton and U.S. rear van treatments were 993 m and 902 m, respectively, with even less difference
in recognition distance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true that compliance with Standard No. 108 and the Metalcore alternative can be achieved with equivalent amounts
of reflective material and that an all white treatment returns more light than a red/white treatment of equal area
(although the petitioner has underestimated the relative brightness of the red material). However, the petitioner's
claims of greater sight distance based on Tansley and Petrusic are in error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The white outlining scheme of Tansley and Petrusic uses 2-inch wide reflective material as does Standard No. 108.
The stripes are perceived at a distance as a line of point sources of light, and the sight distance of a point source depends
on its total light return rather than its luminance per unit area. The sight distance of a 1/2-inch wide stripe will
be less than that of a 2-inch stripe of the same material because it will be perceived as a line of point sources each having
only one fourth the light return. Therefore, the sight distance of the Metalcore alternative will be inferior to the
Tansley and Petrusic scheme cited by the petitioner and to at least the white components of Standard No. 108. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UMTRI report discusses the data of previous researchers concerning the width of conspicuity stripes, and remarked
that ``the luminance of a one-inch treatment must be about double that of a two-inch treatment to achieve equal conspicuity.''
The point source model for visibility distance discussed in the previous paragraph is consistent with data for conspicuity
stripes narrower than 4 inches.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 28, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed amending
Standard No. 105, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Hydraulic Brake Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Air Brake Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
to require medium and heavy vehicles
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be equipped with an antilock brake system (ABS) to improve the lateral stability and control of these vehicles during
braking. (58 FR 50739). The NPRM proposed supplementing the ABS requirement by including a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve
test on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full brake application. The agency believed that the proposed
requirements would improve heavy vehicle stability and control during braking and thus significantly reduce the
deaths and injuries caused when these vehicles jackknife or otherwise lose control. The notice also proposed requiring
an in-cab ABS malfunction lamp and, during a transition period of eight years, an external trailer lamp to warn drivers
of non-ABS tractors of trailer ABS malfunction. The agency believed that the proposed malfunction indicators would
provide valuable information about ABS malfunctioning to the driver and to maintenance and inspection personnel.
The proposal was based on comments received in response to an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) published
on June 8, 1992 and other available information (57 FR 24212).

NHTSA received over 50 comments in response to the NPRM. These commenters included heavy vehicle manufacturers,
brake manufacturers, safety advocacy groups, heavy vehicle users, trade associations, State entities, and other
individuals. The majority of commenters agreed that the agency should take measures to improve the stability and
control of heavy vehicles during braking to reduce the number of loss-of-control crashes. Commenters addressed
specific issues raised in the NPRM, including the decision proposing to require vehicles to be equipped with ABS,
the type of ABS, the braking-in-a-curve test procedure, the implementation schedule for the requirements, the malfunction
indicator requirement, the power requirement, and the rulemaking's cost.

NHTSA believed that this implementation schedule is appropriate given the current state of ABS technology. The agency
believed that it would provide the industry, ABS manufacturers, and maintenance personnel sufficient leadtime
to prepare for the changes that will be required to accommodate the new technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to truck tractors, NHTSA stated that it was confident that ABS for this type of vehicle would be fully developed,
performance tested, and field tested within two years after the final rule since ABS manufacturers have focused their
initial efforts on developing ABS for truck tractors. The agency noted that ABS for truck tractors is currently available
on a commercial basis in this country and throughout Europe. Nevertheless, a two year leadtime appeared to be necessary
to ensure a smooth transition before the agency mandated this technology given the technical complexities and costs
associated with ABS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to trailers, NHTSA noted that ABS manufacturers are currently marketing ABS for these vehicles. NHTSA
stated that it expected its fleet evaluation on 50 ABS-equipped trailers to be completed in 1993. (This evaluation,
titled ``An In-Service Evaluation of the Performance, Reliability, Maintainability, and Durability of Antilock
Braking Systems (ABSs) for Semitrailers'' has been completed and is available for review in the agency's public docket
room. The agency welcomes comments about the report.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to single-unit trucks and buses, NHTSA proposed leadtime of four years and five years, respectively,
after the final rule's publication, resulting in an effective date in 1998 and 1999. NHTSA proposed effective dates
that it believed would give the industry sufficient leadtime to develop, field test, and performance test ABS on straight
trucks and buses. The agency also explained that ABS for such vehicles is still being developed, so these leadtimes
appeared to be necessary to ensure that the technology would be reliable when it is required.

Similarly, manufacturers of brake components and antilock brake systems recommended that the implementation schedule
for the lateral stability and control requirements be accelerated. Rockwell requested that the leadtime for air-braked
single unit trucks and buses be shortened to three years after the final rule. The Heavy Duty Brake Manufacturers Council
requested that the effective dates of the stopping distance rulemaking and the stability rulemaking be ``made coincident
to allow the industry to maximize its efforts by effectively utilizing its limited resources.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Trucking Association (ATA) recommended effective dates of December 31, 1999 for tractors and December
31, 2001 for trailers, claiming that this schedule would permit each fleet, through its own tests, to determine which
ABS is best suited to its operations and to phase ABS in accordingly. In contrast, Advocates for Highway Safety (Advocates)
favored the proposed implementation schedule and opposed any schedule that moved the compliance calendar to the
next century. It believed that a delayed schedule would unreasonably postpone safety benefits for the public because
ABS technology is both reliable and available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has tentatively determined that it may be appropriate to make the effective dates
for the heavy vehicle stability and control requirements concurrent with the stopping distance requirements. This
could facilitate a more orderly implementation process, avoid the need for manufacturers to redesign the brakes
on individual vehicles twice, and reduce the development and compliance costs that manufacturers would face as a
result of these regulations. Specifically, the agency is considering to adopt the following implementation schedule
for both sets of requirements:

This proposed implementation schedule, which would accelerate compliance for air-braked single unit trucks and
buses and hydraulic-braked buses, is consistent with the recommendation of the heavy vehicle manufacturers, brake
manufacturers, and the safety advocacy groups. The agency agrees with the manufacturers that reliable antilock
systems can be developed within this time-frame. NHTSA tentatively concludes that the implementation schedule
recommended by ATA is too protracted, especially in light of the widespread use of ABS in Europe, increased use of ABS
in this country, and the comments by the brake and vehicle manufacturers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests comments about the implementation schedule being proposed in this supplemental notice. Specifically,
commenters should respond to the following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is it appropriate to make the effective dates concurrent for the stopping distance and stability requirements
for heavy vehicles?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is it appropriate to accelerate the stability and control effective dates for air braked trucks and buses and hydraulic
braked buses, and to delay the effective date for the proposed stopping distance requirements for some classes of
vehicles?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Since hydraulic braked trucks and buses would have to be equipped with ABS one year later than air braked trucks and
buses, would truck and bus fleets specify hydraulic brake systems for their new vehicles for that one year to avoid
the additional cost of ABS on air braked trucks and buses?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The agency received comments to the stability and control NPRM from only one bus manufacturer. Do bus manufacturers
have any specific concerns about the revised implementation dates proposed in this notice?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Do the heavy vehicle ABS suppliers have the manufacturing capacity to meet the demand for air braked antilock systems
in 1996 and 1997?

Antilock Brake System Wheel Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that the antilock brake system monitor and control the wheels of the front axle
and of at least one rear axle. NHTSA believed that this would ensure that the wheels on the steering axle are directly
controlled by the antilock braking device. By ``directly controlled,'' the agency meant that the signal provided
at the wheel or on the axle of the wheel directly modulates the braking forces of that wheel. The agency tentatively
concluded that it is necessary to specify that the ABS directly control the steering axle because some ABS control
only a vehicle's drive-axle, a situation which could result in the loss of steering control if the front wheels locked
during braking.

Several commenters addressed the need for front wheel control. ATA strongly opposed mandating ABS for the steering
axle of single-unit trucks and suggested the agency reconsider mandating them on all tractors. In contrast, Rockwell,
WABCO, Freightliner, AAMA, Advocates, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) favored requiring
that ABS be equipped on front axles. AAMA favored equipping each vehicle with ABS that has at least one independent
channel of control for the wheels on a front axle and at least one independent channel of control for the wheels on a rear
axle, but objected to mandating more than two independent channels of control. Because Rockwell, Freightliner,
Advocates, and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) were concerned that the current proposal would
allow ``select low''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 antilock systems on any axle, they recommended that the equipment requirement include language that would require
``independent control of each wheel'' of the axles that are required to be ABS-controlled. They believed such a requirement
would prevent significant degradation in the stopping performance, particularly on a split mu surface.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rockwell WABCO recommended a minimum standard of at least one rear axle having independent wheel brake control. It
opposed allowing select low ABS which it believed would experience significantly longer stopping distances on split
mu surfaces. Allied Signal recommended requiring independent control of the brakes on the steering axle. Bosch recommended
a minimum requirement of a 4S/3M ABS. Freightliner favored requiring at least four independent channels of control,
two for each axle, allowing independent control of each wheel on the forward and rear axle. Similarly, IIHS favored
requiring that the brakes/wheels of the front axle be independently controlled by an antilock system and that the
brakes/wheels of at least one rear axle have similar independent antilock control. Advocates recommended that ABS
be functional on all axles, not just one axle in each multiple axle set on a heavy vehicle. Because commenters differed
on which axle the antilock system should provide independent wheel control, NHTSA has decided to propose requiring
that the wheels on at least one axle be independently controlled, without specifying the axle on which it should be
installed. This would allow manufacturers the flexibility to determine on which axle the wheels would be independently
controlled by the antilock system.

While some ABS are equipped with modulators that independently control each wheel, a select low ABS controls both
wheels on each axle with one modulator while having a wheel speed sensor at each wheel location. As such, both brakes
on the controlled axle are applied and released simultaneously by the ABS. Such a system affords vehicle and directional
stability, and shorter stopping distances on surfaces with uniform friction, but increases stopping distances
if road-surface friction on one side of the vehicle differs from that on the other.

With such a surface, the road is split along its length so that the wheels on one side of the vehicle are on a high friction
surface and the wheels on the other side are on a low friction surface; the term ``mu'' concerns the surface's coefficient
of friction.

After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to propose modifications to the proposal to require heavy vehicles
to be equipped with systems that independently control each wheel on at least one axle of a truck, a truck tractor, or
a bus. Based on the comments and other available information, the agency believes that a minimum requirement that
includes an antilock braking system that controls the wheels on at least one front and one rear axle where the wheels
on at least one of these axles are independently controlled would provide an acceptable level of stopping distance
performance on low mu and split mu surfaces. In addition to the data provided by Freightliner and Rockwell WABCO, the
agency's ABS heavy vehicle testing showed that independent wheel control by an ABS enables a vehicle to stop in a shorter
distance compared with either a vehicle equipped with an axle-by-axle control antilock system, or with a non-ABS
equipped vehicle using a driver best-effort brake application. (``Improved Brake Systems for Commercial Vehicles,''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is also proposing to prohibit tandem control by an antilock system, by requiring that no more than two wheels
be controlled by one modulator valve. As part of its performance test program, the agency tested four different ABS
configurations: individual wheel control, side-by-side control, axle-by-axle control, and tandem control. The
agency found that the tandem control system produced stopping distances that were significantly longer than those
of axle-by-axle control or side-by-side control, particularly on split coefficient of friction surfaces. These
test results are documented in the report, ``Improved Brake Systems for Commercial Vehicles.'' The agency is aware
that the proposed requirements would allow a 6 x 4 truck or truck tractor to be equipped with a 4S/3M antilock system,
i.e., independent control of each front wheel, select low control on one rear axle, and no ABS control on the other rear
axle. The agency's testing has found that vehicle stability is not significantly degraded if two wheels on a tandem
are locked during braking. Accordingly, the agency has used this concept in developing the limited lockup requirements
for the stopping distance rulemaking where one wheel per axle or two wheels per tandem are allowed to lock above 20 mph
during the stopping distance test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests comments to the following questions about independent control of each wheel on at least one axle
and about prohibiting tandem control by an antilock system: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Is it appropriate to require independent control of each wheel on at least one axle? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Would it be appropriate to adopt the alternative recommendations presented by Rockwell, Freightliner, or Advocates?
Would these alternative recommendations provide significantly greater benefits? Would they prevent unreasonably
long stopping distances on split mu surfaces? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Compared to the original proposal that would allow select low systems, what would be the additional marginal benefits
and cost of the requirement proposed in this SNPRM? Of the requirements recommended by Rockwell, Freightliner, or
Advocates? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Is it appropriate to prohibit tandem control by an antilock system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. How much stability degradation has testing showed with a vehicle where one axle of a tandem was not controlled by
ABS? Are there other concerns (e.g., tire flat spotting) about an uncontrolled axle on a tandem? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Would fleet operators be willing to spend an additional $300 per vehicle to upgrade a 4S/3M system to a 4S/4M system
with side-by-side control or axle-by-axle control with in-axle sensors? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

to limit the comment period to 30 days since the agency is statutorily required to finish rulemaking in mid-1994. In
addition, the agency previously provided an opportunity in the September 1993 NPRM to comment on these and other issues
in this rulemaking. This notice proposes relatively limited modifications in the agency's tentative position regarding

This notice is ``significant'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12866. Further, NHTSA has analyzed this supplemental
proposal and determined that it is also significant within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory
policies and procedures. The agency believes that the proposal to make the lateral stability and control requirements
concurrent with the stopping distance requirements would reduce the rulemaking's costs, based on comments by the
manufacturers. The agency further believes that the proposal related to wheel control would reduce cost. The agency's
expectations upon issuing the NPRM were that the ABS on trucks, truck tractors, and buses would provide individual
wheel control on at least one axle. As such, the safety benefits and cost analyses documented in the Preliminary Regulatory
Impact Analysis were performed assuming that to be the case. Therefore, the agency believes that no additional impact
would result from the changes proposed in this notice.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard proposes to amend its regulations for the carriage of certain bulk solid materials by adding materials
carried under Coast Guard Special Permits issued pursuant to this regulation (Special Permits) and other materials
contained in the International Maritime Organization Code of Safe Practice for Solid Bulk Cargoes (IMO Bulk Solids
Code, or ``BC Code''), including coal, to the list of materials permitted under the regulations. The special handling
procedures associated with these materials would also be included in the regulations. The proposed revisions would
harmonize U.S. regulations with recommended international practice, and eliminate the need to apply for Special
Permits, except for newly classified hazardous materials.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bulk solid hazardous materials include materials grouped into a number of specific classes, the definitions of which
are contained in the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Department of Transportation, Hazardous
Materials Regulations (HMR) (49 CFR chapter I, Subchapter C). There are also some solid materials which are not properly
described by any of the hazard classes defined in the HMR, but which when carried in bulk may pose a threat to the vessel
or the crew, most commonly from a tendency to spontaneously generate heat or to deplete the oxygen in the cargo space.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The international standard for the marine transport of solid materials in bulk is the Code of Safe Practice for Solid
Bulk Cargoes, popularly known as the ``BC Code,'' published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In
the BC Code, certain materials which do not fit into the standard IMO hazard classes are placed in the class ``Materials
hazardous only in bulk'' (MHB). This class is defined as materials which, when carried in bulk, present sufficient
hazards to require specific precautions. Examples of such materials include materials that are liable to reduce
the oxygen content in a cargo space, self-heating materials, or materials which become hazardous when wet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BC Code is currently only a recommended standard. However, several countries have adopted the Code in their national
regulations. In addition, recent amendments to Chapter VI of the International Convention for the Safety of Life
at Sea, 1974, as amended, (SOLAS 74/83) adopted certain general provisions of the BC Code. These amendments to Chapter
VI of SOLAS 74/83 were developed by the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes (BC Subcommittee), and adopted
by the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) at its 59th Session in May 1991. As adopted by MSC, the amendments to SOLAS
74/83 entered into force for those countries signatory to the Convention, including the United States, on January
1, 1994. These amendments to SOLAS 74/83 make mandatory the provisions of the BC Code dealing with cargo stowage, the
passage of cargo information from the shipper to the master and the use of oxygen and toxic vapor analyzers. The SOLAS
Chapter VI as amended refers to the BC Code as one possible source of information on the properties and recommended
handling procedures for bulk solid materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many U.S. export shipments are bound for countries which have adopted the BC Code as national regulations. These shipments
therefore already comply with the recommendations of the BC Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard issues Special Permits for shipments of bulk solid materials not listed in 46 CFR part 148 in order to
establish requirements for the safe carriage of these materials. The Special Permits allow the Coast Guard to closely
monitor these shipments in order to determine if the requirements imposed under the permit are adequate to ensure
safe carriage. The Coast Guard also uses Special Permits to allow the shipment of materials not listed in 46 CFR part
148 for which international guidelines have been established. After a history of safe transportation has been established
under a Coast Guard Special Permit, carriage requirements for the material may be included in 46 CFR part 148. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard issues two basic types of Special Permits. The first type of permit is issued for materials for which
recommended handling procedures are contained in the BC Code. This type of permit basically restates the recommendations
contained in the Code. The second type of permit is issued for materials classified as hazardous substances by the
HMR or as hazardous wastes by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). When hazardous substances are transported
in quantities exceeding their reportable quantity (RQ) they, by definition, become hazardous materials. This second
type of Special Permit basically sets forth requirements for preventing crew exposure to the materials and release
of the material to the atmosphere or water.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-five new materials are proposed for inclusion in 46 CFR part 148 as materials which require special handling
when transported in bulk by water. All of the twenty-five are covered by the BC Code; in addition, eleven are regulated
by the HMR (49 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter C), and five are currently subject to Coast Guard Special Permits. Twelve of
the materials proposed for inclusion in 46 CFR part 148 are classified as MHB in the BC Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are ten materials, classified as MHB in the BC Code, which have not previously been regulated by the Coast Guard,
either in 46 CFR part 148 or by Special Permit. It is the Coast Guard's position that these materials, if handled improperly
when loaded as bulk cargoes, pose an unacceptable risk to the vessel and crew. For many of these materials, monitoring
of the cargo space for toxic or flammable gases and oxygen will be required under Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 as amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this proposal is to include in 46 CFR part 148 the above mentioned twenty-five materials and any special
handling procedures associated with these materials, including those requirements which will be imposed by Chapter
VI of SOLAS 74/83 as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As of April 1, 1993, the Coast Guard had the following 45 Special permits outstanding:

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, sixteen comments were received in response to the ANPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Five of the comments requested that the Coast Guard reconsider the necessity of regulating unmanned inland barges
in the same manner as oceangoing vessels. It was never the intent of the Coast Guard to require unmanned barges to comply
with the same requirements as manned vessels. This position is evidenced by question nine in the ANPRM. Barges would
be specifically exempted from complying with the stated requirements in several places in the NPRM. For example,
barges would not be required to carry any gas monitoring equipment. The Coast Guard recognizes that the SOLAS Convention
applies only to self-propelled oceangoing vessels, and that to require vapor detection equipment on unmanned barges
would be unnecessary and impractical since the primary purpose of the equipment is to protect the vessel's crew from
being exposed to harmful vapors or entering spaces which lack the oxygen necessary to support life. Placing personnel
on the vessel to take measurements would increase the likelihood of introducing a source of ignition that would not
otherwise be present. This equipment would also be of little benefit on open hopper barges, where any vapors generated
escape to the atmosphere. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. One comment suggested that the responsibility of the shipper to provide shipping papers be stated with more specificity.
The Coast Guard has adopted this suggestion. Paragraph (a) of &sect;148.60 would contain a provision requiring that
the shipping paper be prepared by the shipper. Additionally, in several sections, including &sect;&sect;148.15(a)
and (b), 148.25(a) and 148.90(c), the responsibility of the shipper would be further clarified. These sections would
state that it is the shipper's responsibility to determine if a Special Permit is required, and to apply for the Special
Permit. The shipper would also be responsible for producing the originating shipping paper, and, most importantly,
the shipper would be responsible for passing information to the master of the vessel (or the tug or towboat operator)
concerning the nature of the cargo to be loaded and any necessary precautions to be taken while loading and transporting
that cargo. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Several comments stated that classification of previously unregulated materials as hazardous would impose unforeseen
burdens on the shippers of these materials. The comments expressed concern that the materials would be subject to
regulations covering all modes of transport, including truck and rail, and that the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) requirements for Material Safety Data Sheets and Hazard Communication Programs would be
applied to shipments of the material.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not the Coast Guard's intent to classify the materials previously unregulated by the Coast Guard as ``hazardous''.
In response to the concerns raised by the comments, this NPRM proposes to change the title of 46 CFR part 148 to ``Bulk
Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling'' thereby eliminating the word ``hazardous''. The proposed rules would
also establish a new classification called ``Potentially Dangerous Materials'' (PDM) which would parallel the
IMO classification MHB. This classification would include materials that may be transported in bulk without posing
undue risk if the precautions described in part 148 are observed. Conversely, if these precautions are not followed,
the material in this category would have the potential to cause harm. In most cases the proposed precautions are simply
good operating procedures that would be followed by a prudent mariner in order to ensure the safety and integrity of
the vessel. Also, proposed &sect;148.1 clearly states that these regulations would apply only to bulk shipments
of these materials by water, and proposed &sect;148.3 clearly states that materials defined as Potentially Dangerous
Materials would be regulated only when being carried as a bulk cargo on board a vessel. These categories and requirements
would clearly reflect the intended status and handling requirements for the materials in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment noted that the amendments to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 will not render the BC Code mandatory, and, that
since the code will remain a recommended standard, it should not be referenced in the Coast Guard regulations. The
fact that IMO has not made the BC Code mandatory through SOLAS does not prohibit any sovereign nation from adopting
the Code or any of its provisions through that nation's domestic statutes and regulations. The Coast Guard proposes,
however, to incorporate by reference in 46 CFR part 148 only those portions of the BC Code dealing with hazardous materials.
Thus, selected pertinent provisions of the BC Code would be adopted in the Coast Guard regulations. Where necessary,
those provisions of the BC Code included in the proposed rules would be modified to fit the nature of the U.S. shipping
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment suggested that the format of the regulations not be substantially altered because those affected by
the regulations are familiar with the current format. The comment suggested that if the motivating concern of the
Coast Guard is reduction of the paperwork burden of the Special Permit process, then the Coast Guard should change
the permitting process to allow for one permit per commodity, with interested shippers becoming a party to that permit,
and extend the expiration date of the permit by ten years. The comment suggested adopting these changes without adding
any of the materials currently carried under Special Permit to the list of materials permitted under the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. It is the Coast Guard's position that while this rule, if adopted,
would alter the current format of the regulations, it would also clarify the responsibilities of shippers and provide
them with important safety information. Elimination of the time-consuming paperwork burden inherent in the Special
Permit process for those materials which have an established record of safe transportation is only one of the motivating
factors for undertaking this regulatory revision. Under this proposal, new or one-time carriers of a material would
be informed of the risks and precautions involved in carrying that material. When the materials currently carried
under Special Permit are not included in the proposed regulations, there is a possibility that a shipper or carrier
might not be aware that a material is potentially dangerous when carried in bulk and therefore might not observe the
appropriate precautions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the inclusion of materials currently carried under Special Permit in 46 CFR part 148 would allow all shippers
more flexibility since they would not have to allow for lead time to obtain a Special Permit, and would have a wider choice
in the number of cargoes that they would be able to carry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. One comment suggested that the Coast Guard differentiate between the hazards associated with the various materials.
This has been done by placing the materials into one of the hazard classes defined by the HMR or by classifying them as
PDM and including provisions with special requirements for materials with the potential to cause significant harm
if mishandled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment stated that there is no need to change U.S. regulations until the amendments to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83
are approved by IMO and the BC Code becomes mandatory. The Coast Guard does not agree with this comment. The amendment
to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 will not make the entire BC Code mandatory, only certain basic provisions concerning the
passage of cargo information from the shipper to the master and the use of vapor detection equipment will become mandatory.
Moreover, since the comment was received, the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83 were adopted at the 59th session
of MSC. Therefore, the Coast Guard has determined that there is no need to further delay the proposal to revise 46 CFR
part 148. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Three comments supported the addition of Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), in both hot-molded and cold-molded briquets,
to the regulations, since they are currently being shipped under Special Permits which mirror the provisions of the
BC Code. The requirements for carrying DRI are included in proposed &sect;&sect;148.245 and 148.250.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Two comments suggested that the provision of Special Permit 1&hyph;92 excepting shipments of DRI lumps, pellets,
and cold-molded briquets on short and sheltered voyages from the requirement that such cargoes must be inerted or
inhibited should be extended to voyages made entirely on the inland waters of the U.S. This comment is adopted and is
included in proposed &sect;148.245(h)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. One comment recommended that precautions for entering inerted holds be added to the requirements for carrying
DRI lumps, pellets and cold-molded briquets. The comment noted that when carbon dioxide is the inerting medium, a
safety risk could possibly be created by carbon monoxide produced by reaction between the carbon dioxide and the DRI.
The recommendation is adopted and appropriate requirements for analyzing the atmosphere of the cargo hold for carbon
monoxide and oxygen prior to entry are included in proposed &sect;148.245(g). Also, that section is referenced in
proposed Table 148.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Four comments recommended that the Coast Guard refrain from publishing any proposed requirements for the carriage
of coal prior to receiving the final report of the Chemical Transportation Advisory Committee (CTAC) Subcommittee
on Coal Transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CTAC formed the Coal Subcommittee in order to obtain the recommendations of the U.S. coal industry, and the Coast Guard
did not intend to publish any requirements for the carriage of coal prior to receiving the Subcommittee's report.
Since this comment was received, the final report of the Coal Subcommittee was submitted to and approved by CTAC. Subsequently,
the Coast Guard prepared and submitted a proposal based on the Coal Subcommittee's final report to the 31st session
of the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes (The ``BC Subcommittee''). The U.S. proposal, with some slight
modifications, was adopted by the BC Subcommittee; and in 1991, the provisions of the BC Code dealing with the transport
of coal were amended accordingly. Proposed &sect;148.240 is based on the BC Code as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;148.240 differs from the report of the CTAC Coal Subcommittee in the following respects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The report offers no guidance on the frequency of monitoring for methane and carbon monoxide, while paragraphs
(i) and (l) of proposed &sect;148.240 set out minimum testing frequency for that coal which is most likely to create
dangerous conditions. Under proposed &sect;148.240(n), it would be within the discretion of the master to reduce
the frequency of monitoring in certain situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The report does not specify that the temperature of a self-heating coal must be monitored. Paragraph (j) of proposed
&sect;148.240 would require such monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The report directs the master to seek expert advice and to consider heading for the nearest suitable port of refuge
if it is determined that the coal is heating. Proposed &sect;148.240(k) would require the master to contact the nearest
Coast Guard Captain of the Port when a coal cargo is heating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments about coal concern the effects of designating coal as a hazardous material and question the necessity
of regulating barge shipments of coal. These issues are addressed in the discussion on the designation of certain
materials as potentially dangerous, and in the discussion of the treatment of barge shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Two comments recommended that, based on experience gained while shipping uncalcined petroleum coke under the
terms of a Coast Guard Special Permit, uncalcined petroleum coke be treated in the same manner as calcined petroleum
coke in the proposed regulations. This recommendation is adopted and is included in &sect;148.295. In addition,
the Coast Guard submitted a paper to the 30th session of the IMO Subcommittee on Containers and Cargoes recommending
that a similar change be made to the BC Code. This proposal met with approval and the BC Code was amended accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. One comment requested that a public hearing be held in the event that woodchips and wood pulp pellets were not removed
from this rulemaking. The Coast Guard declined to schedule a public hearing at this stage of the rulemaking. The only
requirement for shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets included in this proposed rule is that closed holds be
tested prior to entry to ensure that they contain sufficient oxygen to support life. Because most U.S. shipments of
woodchips and wood pulp pellets are currently made in open barges, this requirement would not apply to most U.S. shipments.
The requirement is retained in this proposal in order to comply with the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83. Because
the requirement would not apply to most U.S. shipments of woodchips and wood pulp pellets, the Coast Guard has determined
that a public hearing is not necessary at this time.

Subpart 97.12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart 97.12 of 46 CFR part 97 would be revised to clarify that the subpart would apply to bulk solid cargoes in general
and not only to ores and ore concentrates. Due to experience gained from a casualty to a foreign vessel that loaded a
bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port, the Coast Guard also proposes to extend the applicability of this part to foreign vessels
operating in U.S. navigable waters. Further, existing &sect;97.12&hyph;5, which has not been revised since 1965,
references a manual that was the predecessor of the BC Code and that is no longer in print. The revised section would
include reference to the BC Code as a source of information for use in complying with the requirement that the master
of a vessel be furnished with guidance on safe loading and stowage.

As discussed, the title of part 148 would be changed to read ``Bulk Solid Materials Requiring Special Handling''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NPRM also proposes to modify the structure of the regulations from four to six subparts. Each is explained below
briefly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A would state the purpose and applicability of the regulations, define terms used in the part, and list (in
tabular form) the solid materials permitted to be carried as bulk cargoes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart B would provide all relevant information concerning Special Permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart C would set forth minimum transportation requirements for all materials regulated by 46 CFR part 148 and the
requirements for shipping papers and Dangerous Cargo Manifests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart D would set forth general stowage and segregation requirements for materials according to their hazard class,
and, in addition, would contain stowage and segregation requirements for specific materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart E would contain special handling, loading, and carriage requirements for specific materials. The requirements
for specific materials in subpart D and this subpart would be in addition to the minimum requirements for all materials
and the general requirements for their respective hazard classes contained in subpart C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart F would contain requirements for special equipment or procedures when dealing with certain cargoes. The
requirements of this part would apply when dealing with a cargo only if a provision from this part is included in Table
148.10 in reference to a particular material included in that cargo. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current sections of part 148 would be revised and renumbered as follows:

The appendices B, D.1, D.4 and D.5 of the 1991 Edition of the BC Code would be incorporated by reference. Several provisions
of the proposed rules require the performance of tests specified in the BC Code appendices. Shippers and carriers
in international commerce will be able to comply with the BC Code where such compliance is required by the administration
of the country of origin or destination.

The format for table 148.10 would be modified. The table would include the UN number and hazard class of the materials
and references to sections of special requirements to be followed whenever that material is carried. These revisions

These sections would clarify when a Special Permit is required, who would have to apply for a Special Permit, what information
would be required to be submitted to obtain a Special Permit, and who would be covered by the Special Permit once it is
issued. These proposed sections are more detailed than the current regulations in order to more clearly state each
person's responsibility and to clear up recurring misunderstandings concerning the applicability of the Special
Permit. The submittal of detailed information about the material carried would also greatly decrease the amount
of time currently spent by the Coast Guard in doing the necessary research to process each petition for a Special Permit.

Section 148.270. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section would establish a new category of materials in part 148. Hazardous substances have previously been carried
only under Special Permits issued on a case by case basis. Hazardous substances are classified by the EPA based on the
potential of an accidental release of the material to endanger public health or welfare or the environment. The EPA
assigns to each hazardous substance a ``Reportable Quantity'' (RQ), which is that quantity, the release of which,
requires notification pursuant to 40 CFR part 302. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HMR, in 49 CFR 171.8, defines hazardous materials as including hazardous substances. Hazardous substances are
defined as materials, including mixtures and solutions, that are listed in the appendix to &sect;172.101 and that
are present in a quantity, in one package, that exceeds the RQ of that substance. The definition further sets out the
concentration of a hazardous substance, for mixtures and solutions, that must be present before the mixture or solution
is considered a hazardous substance. For bulk shipments, the entire shipment would be taken into consideration since
there is no package. RQs assigned by EPA do not exceed 5,000 pounds, so any bulk shipment of hazardous substance would
be a shipment of a hazardous material. This section would not relieve the shipper or the master from any of the reporting
requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 302, but would set out minimum requirements for the safe carriage of solid hazardous
substances in bulk.

In spite of the stated intention of this rulemaking to harmonize U.S. regulations with the BC Code, this section, which
applies to zinc ashes, zinc dross, zinc residues, and zinc skimmings, differs significantly from the BC Code. The
provisions of this section are based on two Coast Guard Special Permits, SP 8&hyph;83 and SP 4&hyph;84. The terms of
these permits were developed as the result of a number of incidents involving fires or explosions in cargoes of zinc
skimmings, including at least one with loss of life. The intention of this section is to reduce the possibility of hydrogen
gas generation caused by the reaction of seawater and zinc. Under the proposed section, the cargo hold of vessels selected
to carry zinc ashes, zinc dross, zinc residues or zinc skimmings must be equipped with mechanical ventilation using
motors approved for use in hydrogen gas atmospheres, permanently installed combustible gas detectors, and temperature-sensing
thermocouples.

Section 148.450. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 11, 1991, off the coast of California, a foreign-flag vessel that had loaded a bulk solid cargo in a U.S. port
developed a severe list due to shifting of the cargo. Fortunately, this vessel was able to return to port and off-load
its cargo. The Coast Guard investigation of this marine casualty determined that the cargo shifted because its moisture
content exceeded the safe transportable limit, and that this caused the cargo to behave as a liquid. Due to this marine
casualty and others of a similar nature, the Coast Guard proposes to add a new section that prescribes requirements
for bulk solid cargoes that are subject to liquefaction. The proposed regulations are adapted from the BC Code and
would only apply to calcined pyrites, coal, and metal sulfide concentrates as indicated in table 148.10. The proposed
rules would recommend, but not require, use of the test procedures in appendix D of the BC Code to determine the moisture
content and transportable moisture limit of bulk solid cargoes.

Regulatory Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A draft Regulatory Assessment
is available in the docket for inspection and copying where indicated under ``ADDRESSES''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations would have a multifaceted economic impact on the bulk solids transportation industry.
The Coast Guard estimates that if these regulations are adopted there would be an economic impact on the entire bulk
solid shipping industry of $391,653 per year, after an initial investment of $168,000. Costs associated with preparation
of the vessels and operation and maintenance of the equipment are estimated to be $373,440 annually. The cost of doing
the paperwork necessary under the proposed revisions to this part is estimated to be $18,213 annually, which is less
than half of the $43,745 estimated for the current regulations due to the elimination of the need to apply for Special
Permits for most cargoes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments to add those materials currently carried under Special Permit to those listed in 46 CFR part 148 that may
be carried with special handling, will, if adopted, reduce the paperwork burden on the regulated industry and the
Coast Guard, and provide greater flexibility for shippers of bulk solid materials.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that the bulk solid materials affected by this proposal would be shipped on 18 vessels, by at least one
hundred different shippers. Therefore, the cost of these regulations would be divided among numerous interests
and would not significantly impact any particular interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as
a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment

Special Permits allow the Coast Guard to ensure safety while allowing the shipping industry the flexibility to ship
new materials. Shipping papers are necessary to identify the cargo being shipped and the hazard associated with the
cargo. The Dangerous Cargo Manifest provides information on the location and quantity of hazardous materials on
board a vessel. Shipper's certificates ensure that certain cargoes are acceptable for shipment by vessel.

Federalism

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rulemaking proposes regulations under which certain solid materials requiring special handling may be transported
in bulk by water. The regulations would apply to each domestic and foreign vessel, which is not exempted under 49 U.S.C.
1806(b), that transports solid materials requiring special handling when transported in bulk, when in the navigable
waters of the United States. The authority to establish such regulations for vessels operating in the navigable waters
of the United States has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. Furthermore, since vessels tend to
move from port to port in the national and international marketplace, the safety standards proposed in this rule should
be of national scope to avoid burdensome variances. Therefore, the Coast Guard intends this rule, if adopted, to preempt
state action addressing the same subject matter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The only environmental impact of this rulemaking would be to decrease the likelihood of a spill or release of hazardous
material into the environment. This decrease in the probability of a spill can be attributed to an increased awareness
of the potential danger of hazardous bulk solid materials, and the decreased risk of a fire or explosion on a vessel
carrying these materials. Since bulk carriers currently have a very low rate of spills and releases, this impact would
be minimal.

(2) The surface of the coal is trimmed to a reasonable level to the boundary bulkheads; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Each casing leading into the cargo hold and all other openings to the cargo hold are sealed prior to loading the coal,
and that, unless the coal is as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the hatches are sealed after the coal is trimmed;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) As far as reasonably practicable, no gases which may be emitted by the coal accumulate in enclosed working spaces
such as storerooms, shops, or passageways, and that such spaces are adequately ventilated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The vessel has adequate ventilation as required by paragraph (f) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If paragraph (e) of this section requires the temperature of the coal to be monitored_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The temperature of the coal to be loaded does not, at the time of loading exceed 15
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (27
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) above the ambient temperature or 41
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (105
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) whichever is greater; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (32
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) without requiring entry into the cargo hold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A cargo hold containing coal must not be ventilated unless the conditions of paragraph (f) of this section are met,
or unless methane is detected under paragraph (h) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) If the shipper, terminal operator, or the master of the vessel has any information pertaining to the coal that indicates
that the coal to be loaded has been handled in such a manner as to increase its susceptibility to self-heating, has a
history of self-heating, or has been observed to be heating, the temperature of the coal must be monitored prior to
loading. The monitoring must be at intervals sufficient to determine whether the temperature of the coal is increasing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the shipper, terminal operator, or the master of the vessel has any information pertaining to the coal that indicates
that the coal to be loaded, is freshly mined, or has a history of emitting dangerous amounts of methane, then surface
ventilation, either natural or from fixed or portable nonsparking fans, must be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Electrical equipment and cables in a hold containing a coal described in paragraph (f) of this section must be suitable
for use in an explosive gas atmosphere, or must be deenergized at a point remote from the hold. Electrical equipment
and cables necessary for continuous safe operations, such as lighting fixtures, may not be deenergized. The master
of the vessel shall ensure that the affected equipment and cables remain deenergized as long as this coal remains in
the hold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) For all coal loaded on a vessel, other than an unmanned barge, for a voyage with a duration of more than 72 hours, the
atmosphere above the coal must be routinely tested for the presence of methane, carbon monoxide and oxygen. This testing
must be performed in such a way that the cargo hatches are not opened and entry into the hold is not necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When carrying a coal described in paragraph (e) of this section, the atmosphere above the coal must be monitored
for the presence of carbon monoxide as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section. The results of this monitoring
must be recorded at least twice in every 24 hour period, unless the conditions of paragraph (n) of this section are met.
If the level of carbon monoxide is increasing rapidly or reaches 30% of the LFL, the frequency of monitoring must be
increased.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has adopted and is making available
an environmental assessment prepared by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, with substantial assistance
from APHIS, for the Asian gypsy moth eradication project in North Carolina. We are also making available APHIS' own
finding of no significant impact and record of decision for the Asian gypsy moth eradication project in North Carolina.
The environmental assessment provides a basis for the conclusion that the methods employed to eradicate the plant
pest will not have a significant impact on the environment.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 7 U.S.C. 147a, 148, and 450, the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with the States
and certain other organizations and individuals to control and eradicate plant pests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Asian gypsy moth, which is present in the State of North Carolina, is a destructive pest of plants, especially trees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture (NCDA),
has initiated a project to eradicate the Asian gypsy moth in North Carolina. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCDA, with substantial assistance from USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), has prepared
an environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate the effects of this eradication project on the environment. Based on
the EA and APHIS' own analysis, the Agency has determined that the eradication project in the State of North Carolina
will not have a significant impact on the environment. APHIS has reviewed and adopted the EA that was prepared by NCDA
with substantial assistance from APHIS. The EA for this cooperative Asian gypsy moth eradication project is supported
by and tiered to the Gypsy Moth Suppression and Eradication Projects, Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS)
as Supplemented, 1985. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental assessment, finding of no significant impact, and record of decision have been prepared in accordance
with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.

In accordance with section 506 (b) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, the Secretary is authorized and directed
to conduct research, technical studies, and demonstrations relating to the mission and programs of FmHA and the national
housing goals defined in section 2 of this Act. In connection with such activities, the Secretary shall seek to promote
the construction of adequate farm and other rural housing. The Secretary shall conduct such activities for the purposes
of stimulating construction and improving the architectural design and utility of dwellings and buildings. In furtherance
of this goal, the Rural Rental Housing Diversity Demonstration Program (RRHDDP) is implemented. An appropriate
amount of section 521 new construction rental assistance (RA) is set aside for use with section 515 loan funds.

Procurement of labor, goods, and services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the intents of the RRHDDP is to stimulate the local economy by encouraging procurement of labor, goods, and services
from the local area. FmHA recognizes that defining a local trade area in which to procure the labor, goods, and services
to build an apartment complex is difficult in rural America. To be responsive to the application procedures, applicants
must procure labor, goods, and services from Level One of this paragraph. If labor, goods, and services are not available
in Level One of this paragraph, the applicant may use the trade area defined in Level Two of this paragraph. Documentation
as to why the labor, goods, and services are not available in Level One of this paragraph must be included in the case
file. The applicant may propose to secure labor, goods, and services from Levels Three or Four of this paragraph; however,
documentation as to why same is not available in all of the previous levels must be included in the case file.

Outreach. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Outreach efforts publicizing the availability of loan funds for the eligible RRHDDP States will be aggressively
carried out. Each affected State Director will develop an outreach plan which includes such techniques as news releases,
community meetings, coordination with other Federal, State, and local government organizations, to promote full
utilization of these funds by all qualified applicants regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, marital
status, age, and sex. In addition to the above outreach efforts, States with eligible colonias and/or Tribal lands
should establish liaison with community groups in order to leverage support and assistance provided to residents
of colonias and Tribal lands.

The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal, demographic, household survey in which
the Census Bureau interviews sample households in waves occurring every 4 months over a 21/2 year period. The survey
is molded around a central ``core'' of labor force and income questions that remain fixed during each wave of a panel.
The core is periodically supplemented with questions designed to answer specific needs. These supplemental questions
are referred to as ``topical modules.'' As part of our transition plans for SIPP from paper to an automated questionnaire,
the Census Bureau is requesting an extension of the 1992 Panel in order to conduct 2 additional waves of interviews.
The topical modules for Wave 9 include the following: 1) Work Schedule, 2) Child Care, 3) Child Support Agreements,
4) Support for Nonhousehold Members, 5) Functional Limitations and Disabilities&hyph;Adults, 6) Utilization
of Health Care Services&hyph;Adults, 7) Functional Limitations and Disabilities&hyph;Children, 8) Utilization
of Health Care Services&hyph;Children, and 9) Children's Well&hyph;Being. Wave 9 interviews will be conducted
from October 1994 through January 1995. Wave 10 interviews will have no topical modules and will be conducted from
February 1995 through May 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In a petition submitted by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, on March 11, 1994, the Department of
Commerce was requested to initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended
(19 U.S.C. 1862), to determine the effects on the national security of imports of crude oil and petroleum products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 5, 1994, the Department of Commerce formally accepted the application and initiated an investigation. The
findings and recommendations of the investigation are to be reported by the Secretary of Commerce to the President
no later than December 31, 1994 (i.e., within 270 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The items to be investigated have distinct Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) tariff classification numbers. They include
the following HTS numbers and earlier TSUS numbers:

This publication announces the adoption of the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for VHDL. This FIPS
adopts American National Standard Hardware Description Language VHDL (ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993) as stipulated
in the Specifications Section. The American National Standard specifies the form and establishes the interpretation
of programs expressed in VHDL. The purpose of the standard is to promote portability of VHDL programs for use on a variety
of data processing systems. The standard is used by implementors as the reference authority in developing compilers,
interpreters, analyzers, simulators or other forms of high level language processors, and is used by digital hardware
designers, and by other computer professionals who need to know the precise syntactic and semantic rules of the standard
and who need to provide specifications for digital hardware descriptions.

8. Objectives. Federal standards for high level digital design information and documentation languages permit
Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the design, production, management, and
maintenance of digital electronic systems. The primary objectives of this Federal hardware description language
standard are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_To encourage more effective utilization of design personnel by ensuring that design skills acquired under one job
are transportable to other jobs, thereby reducing the cost of programmer retraining;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the cost of design by achieving increased designer productivity and design accuracy through the use of
formal languages;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce the overall life cycle cost for digital systems by establishing a common documentation language for the
transfer of digital design information across organizational boundaries;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To protect the immense investment of digital hardware from obsolescence by insuring to the maximal feasible extent
that Federal hardware description language standards are technically sound and that subsequent revisions are compatible
with the installed base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce Federal inventory of electronic digital replacement parts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To increase the sources of supplies which can satisfy government requirements for mission specific electronic
digital components.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard language specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Federal standards for hardware description languages are applicable for the design and documentation of digital
systems developed for government use. This standard is suitable for use in the following digital system applications:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Primary design and documentation of digital systems, subsystems, assemblies, hybrid components, and components;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Formal specifications of digital systems throughout the procurement, contracting and development process;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Test generation for digital systems, subsystems, assemblies, hybrid components, and components;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Re-procurement and redesign of digital systems, subsystems, assemblies, hybrid components, and components.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The use of FIPS hardware description languages applies when one or more of the following situations exist:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_When using a formal language for specifying a formal design specification for a complex digital system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The digital system is under constant revision during the development process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_It is desired to have the design understood by multiple groups, or organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The system under development is to be designed by multiple groups, or organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Accurate unambiguous specifications are required in the bid and contracting process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Specifications. The specifications for this standard are the language specifications contained in ANSI/IEEE
1076&hyph;1993, IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This FIPS does not allow conforming implementations to extend the language. A conforming implementation is one that
does not allow inclusion of substitute or additional language elements in order to accomplish a feature of the language
as specified in the language standard. A conforming implementation is one which adheres to and implements all of the
language specifications contained in ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993 except where the language standard permits deviations
and which specifies conspicuously in a separate section in the conforming implementation documentation all such
permitted variations. Also, such conformance shall be with default language processor system option settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANSI/IEEE 1076&hyph;1993 document does not specify limits on the size or complexity of programs, the results
when the rules of the standard fail to establish an interpretation, the means of supervisory control programs, or
the means of transforming programs for processing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Implementation. The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of
VHDL processors, interpretation of FIPS VHDL, and validation of VHDL processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.1. Effective Date. This revised standard becomes effective three (3) months after the publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing approval by the Secretary of Commerce. Prior to that date the requirements of FIPS PUB 172 apply to Federal
VHDL procurements. This delayed effective date is intended to provide sufficient time for implementors of FIPS PUB
172 to make enhancements necessary for conformance of products to FIPS PUB 172&hyph;1. No further transitional period
is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.2. Acquisition of Ada Processors. Conformance to FIPS VHDL should be considered whether VHDL processors are developed
internally, acquired as part of an ADP system procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing
arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for hardware description services. Recommended terminology for
procurement of FIPS Ada is contained in the U.S. General Services Administration publication Federal ADP &amp; Telecommunications
Standards Index, chapter 4 part 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.3. Interpretation of FIPS VHDL. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provides for the resolution
of questions regarding the specifications and requirements, and issues official interpretations as needed. All
questions about the interpretation of this standard should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory,
ATTN: FIPS VHDL Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Voice:
301&hyph;975&hyph;2490, FAX: 301&hyph;948&hyph;6213.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11.4. Validation of VHDL Processors: The validation of VHDL processors for conformance to this standard applies
when NIST VHDL validation procedures are available. At the present time NIST does not have procedures for validating
VHDL processors. NIST is currently investigating methods which may be considered for validating processors for
conformance to this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Waivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government wide savings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology, ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, room
B&hyph;154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), shall be part
of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the NVLAP Procedures (15 CFR part 7), the Director of NIST may terminate a field of testing or a LAP when the Director
NIST determines that a need no longer exists to accredit laboratories for the services covered under the scope of a
LAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requests comments on proposed termination of selected
fields of testing in the Computer/Electronics and Product Testing Laboratory Accreditation Programs offered by
NVLAP, and announces a 60 day comment period for that purpose. The fields of testing proposed for termination are High
Level Protocols, DDN X.25/Blacker Host, Plastics, Seals and Sealants, and Solid Fuel Room Heaters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of all NVLAP programs revealed that these particular fields of testing had very small and/or declining laboratory
enrollments which makes their continuance impractical. NVLAP operates solely on a fee reimbursable basis and it
was determined that fees from laboratories in these fields of testing could not support the costs required to maintain
the programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a comment period, the Director of NIST shall determine if public support exists for the continuation of the fields
of testing. If public comments support the continuation of the fields of testing, the Director of NIST shall publish
a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice announcing their continuation. If public support does not exist for continuation, the fields of testing will
be terminated effective 90 days after the date of this notice of intent to terminate the fields of testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons interested in commenting on the proposed terminations should submit their comments in writing to the address
below. All comments received in response to this notice will become part of the public record and will be available
for inspection and copying at the NIST Records Inspection Facility.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology administers the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation
Program under regulations as found in part 7 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. NVLAP provides an unbiased
third party evaluation and recognition of laboratory performance, as well as expert technical assistance to upgrade
that performance by accrediting calibration and testing laboratories found competent to perform specific tests
or calibrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP accreditation is available to commercial laboratories, manufacturer's in-house laboratories, and federal,
state and local government laboratories. Foreign-based laboratories may also be accredited if they meet the same
requirements as domestic laboratories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NVLAP is comprised of a series of Laboratory Accreditation Programs (LAPS) which are established on the basis of requests
and demonstrated need. Each LAP includes specific test and/or calibration standards and related methods and protocols
assembled to satisfy the unique needs for accreditation in a field of testing, field of calibration, product of service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(j) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA) (15 U.S.C. 2053(j)) requires the Commission to establish an
agenda for action under the laws it administers, and priorities for action at least 30 days before the beginning of
each fiscal year. Section 4(j) of the CPSA provides further that before establishing its agenda and priorities for
action, the Commission shall conduct a public hearing and provide an opportunity for the submission of comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection of priorities from the Commission's agenda of projects and programs is a crucial step in the development
of the Commission's budget for each fiscal year. The Office of Management and Budget requires all Federal agencies
to submit their budget requests 13 months before the beginning of each fiscal year. The Commission is beginning the
process of formulating its budget request for fiscal year 1996, which begins on October 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, the Commission will conduct a public hearing on May 12, 1994, to receive comments from the public concerning
its agenda and priorities for fiscal year 1996. The Commissioners desire to obtain the views of a wide range of interested
persons including consumers; manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers of consumer products; members
of the academic community; consumer advocates; and health and safety officers of state and local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is charged by Congress with protection of the public from unreasonable risks of injury associated
with consumer products. The Commission enforces and administers the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2051

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (15 U.S.C. 1471 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); and the Refrigerator Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1211 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Standards and regulations issued under provisions of those statutes are codified in the Code of Federal Regulations,
title 16, chapter II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Commission has broad jurisdiction over products used by consumers in or around their homes, in schools,
in recreation, and other settings, its staff and budget are limited. Section 4(j) of the CPSA expresses Congressional
direction to the Commission to establish an agenda for action each fiscal year and to select from that agenda a limited
number of projects for priority attention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission priorities are selected in accordance with the Commission statement of policy governing establishment
of priorities codified at 16 CFR 1009.8. That policy statement includes the following factors to be considered by
the Commission when selecting its priorities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Frequency and severity of injuries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Causality of injuries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Chronic illness and future injuries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Costs and benefits of Commission action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Unforeseen nature of a risk of injury.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Vulnerability of the population at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Probability of exposure to hazard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order of listing of these criteria does not indicate their relative importance. The Commission will consider
these criteria to the extent feasible and as interactively as possible when evaluating each candidate project in
the selection of its priorities for fiscal year 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who desire to make oral presentations at the hearing on May 12, 1994, should call or write Sheldon Butts, Deputy
Secretary, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Washington, DC 20207, telephone (301) 504&hyph;0800, telefax
(301) 504&hyph;0127, not later than April 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presentations should be limited to approximately ten minutes. Persons desiring to make presentations must submit
the written text of their presentations to the Office of the Secretary not later than May 5, 1994. The Commission reserves
the right to impose further time limitations on all presentations and further restrictions to avoid duplication
of presentations. The hearing will begin at 10 a.m. on May 12, 1994, and will conclude the same day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments on the Commission's agenda and priorities for fiscal year 1996, should be received in the Office
of the Secretary not later than May 5, 1994.

Notes on Reimbursable Rates
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
1Daily percentages are applied to both inpatient and outpatient services provided when billing third party payers
(such as insurance companies). Pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 1095, the inpatient daily percentages are
55 percent hospital, 5 percent physician, 40 percent ancillary. The outpatient daily percentages are 57 percent
hospital, 10 percent physicians and 33 percent ancillary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2DoD civilian employees located in overseas areas shall be rendered a bill when services are performed. Payment is
due 60 days from the date of the bill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3Charges for PRIMUS/NAVCARE and high cost medications/services requested by external providers (Physicians,
Dentists, etc.) are only relevant to the Third Party Collection Program. Third party payers (such as insurance companies)
shall be billed for high cost services in those instances in which non-active duty eligible beneficiaries have medical
insurance and are seen by providers external to a Military Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) and obtain the prescribed
service or medication from an MTF. Eligible beneficiaries are not personally liable for this cost and shall not be
billed by the MTF. The standard cost of high cost medications includes the cost of the drugs and dispensing services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4All quantities shown are tablets unless otherwise stated. The third party charge is only for the strengths and the
dosage cited. Charges will vary if the strengths and dosage are changed. The method of computing standards costs to
be charged for high cost medications is actual cost to the pharmacy, plus a 30 percent dispensing fee. Only medications
listed in this schedule may be billed. If a different dose is issued for a medication that is listed, only bill if the
cost is $100 or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5The attending physician is to complete the common procedure terminology code to indicate the appropriate procedure
followed during cosmetic surgery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6Cosmetic surgery rates will be charged for dependents of active duty members, retirees, and their dependents and
survivors. The patient shall be charged the rate as specified in the FY 1994 reimbursable rates for an episode of care.
The charges for elective cosmetic surgery are at the full reimbursement rate (designated as the Other rate_in Section
I, ``Inpatient and Outpatient Rates'' and Section II, ``Per Outpatient Visit''). The patient will be responsible
for both the cost of the implant(s) and prescribed rates.

<DOCTITLE>Supplemental Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton Air Force Base (AFB), CA</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 30, 1994, the Air Force signed the Supplemental ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB. The decisions
included in this Supplemental ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained
in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 4, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Norton AFB will close on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment
Act (BCRA) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base Realignment
and Closure. This Supplemental ROD documents certain disposal decisions which this office previously deferred,
and modifies certain previous decisions made in the December 15, 1993, Partial ROD supplemented on January 14, 1994.
The decisions in this document, coupled with those in the previous ROD, complete the disposal decisions for Norton
AFB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision conveyed by the Partial ROD was to dispose of Norton AFB in a manner that enabled the development of a regional
airport with the capacity for commercial and industrial development. This allowed for the central theme of the proposed
future land use plans discussed in the FEIS to be fully implemented. The environmental findings and mitigation measures
contained in the initial ROD remain fully applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 109 acres within three (3) noncontiguous parcels are retained within the Department of Defense for
continued military use. This Supplemental ROD contains minor boundary realignments of some parcels previously
addressed. Two (2) parcels comprising approximately 24.9 acres were declared access and are reserved for transfer
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. In total, approximately 1,942 acres are surplus to the needs
of he Federal Government. The base has been divided into twenty-four (24) parcels of land, roadways and utilities.
Five (5) airfield parcels were previously conveyed for public benefit (airport purposes), and three (3) parcels
were previously made available for negotiated sale to eligible public bodies or public sale. Two (2) parcels will
be assigned to the Secretary of the Interior for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance for recreation purposes,
two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Department of Education for further disposal as a public benefit conveyance
for health purposes, and two (2) parcels will be assigned to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for further
disposal as a public benefit conveyance for homeless assistance. Eight (8) parcels will be conveyed by negotiated
sale. The road network is an integral part of all parcels. Primary roads may be conveyed by negotiated sale to an eligible
public body. Secondary roadways that fall within a parcel completely will be included as part of the parcel. The utility
systems are totally integrated systems, prohibiting their separation among the various parcels. Therefore, disposal
of the utility systems will include conditions under which the recipients must provide service to all parcels. Utility
easements will be granted as appropriate. The gas and electric systems with appropriate easements for maintenance
and repair will be conveyed through negotiated sale to utility purveyors, or eligible public bodies. Water and wastewater
are required to support redevelopment efforts and are contingent on the recipient continuing to provide the necessary
service to all parcels. Water and wastewater systems will be assigned to HHS contingent upon formal request for conveyance
for use in the protection of public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal
adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statutes and regulations,
and all reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E.B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696&hyph;5534.
Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, Suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The option to download the following information from the AAIS is available for all selections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Advanced Planning Briefings for Industry (APBI): APBI provides 5-year projected requirements for AMCCOM ammunition,
weapons, and chemical items, as well as 1-year projected requirements for AMCCOM spare parts. In addition, the system
contains a listing of upcoming conferences which industry may attend, and various publications which are available
for information purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Performance Incentive Contracting (PIC): PIC is designed to obtain the best purchase value for the Government
after considering price and contractor performance history. The Government recognizes that even among responsible
contractors there are different degrees of performance risk. The Government, under this program, is willing to pay
higher prices to lower risk contractors to obtain on-time delivery of quality products. The PIC program works under
the premise that award to a contractor with a good delivery and quality record for the Federal Stock Class (FSC) in question
will improve the chances of the Government receiving a quality product on time. Under the PIC program, an award may
be made to other than the low-price offeror. The on-line system provides the policy, definitions, applicability,
procedures, and clauses/provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Procurement History: The history provided is pertinent to HQ, AMCCOM (R) procurement only. The contractor is prompted
to enter the NIIN (last nine positions of the NSN). If record is found, the latest unit price, award date and contractor
is provided. A former restriction on the number of history requests that the Central Processing Point allowed per
day has been eliminated for those contractors who utilize this system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Solicitation Information: The program provides daily information on solicitations issued from HQ, AMCCOM. The
data displayed is the same type of information currently provided in the lobby area of HQ, AMCCOM. Daily synopses that
are published in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) are available to view or search on a particular keyboard. Cancelled
and not issued status is provided by entering a solicitation number. A hard copy of the solicitation and the technical
data package (TDP) can be requested electronically. Requests are accepted whether you have a Federal Supply Code
for Manufacturers (FSCM) code or not. Viewing the contents of solicitations issued by HQ, AMCCOM can be performed
on-line or downloaded to a personal computer (PC) for further review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Industrial Committee of Ammunition Procedures (ICAP): The program provides the minutes from recent ICAP meetings.
These minutes are provided in order to make industry more aware of information being discussed by the committee. The
program also contains a forecast of agenda topics and the current roster of the ICAP members identified by the segment
of industry each member represents. The minutes are prepared by industry and are included in the system through the
office of the AMCCOM Command Ombudsman.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Excess Production Equipment: Provides information on Government-owned excess production equipment. Three
menu selections provide: (1) Location and amount of excess production equipment; (2) details on sales of production
equipment; (3) listing of production equipment that is identified for excess/redistribution. This allows the user
to search by manufacturer name or key word in the description.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The overall project was authorized for water quality control by the Flood Control Act of 1966, Public Law 89&hyph;789;
as modified by the Flood Control Act approved 31 December 1970, Public Law 91&hyph;611; and as amended by the Water
Resources Development Acts of 1974 and 1976. A final environmental impact statement for the project dated July 1976
was filed and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 27 May 1977. Facilities already constructed include a ring dike at Estelline Springs (Area V), the Bateman low-flow
collection dam on the South Fork of the Wichita River (Area VIII) and Truscott Brine Lake which is located on Bluff Creek,
a tributary of the North Fork of the Wichita River near Truscott, Texas. The Lowrance (Area X) low-flow collection
facility, which will pump into Truscott, is currently under construction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds have been appropriated to begin completion of design and construction of the remaining authorized facilities
at Areas VI, VII, IX, Crowell Brine Lake, XIII, and XIV, Oklahoma and Texas. Significant issues to be addressed in the
DSEIS include changes in the pool size of the Crowell Brine Lake, changes in methods of collection and disposal (Deep
Well Injection) at Areas XIII and XIV, and possible changes in location and types of collection facilities and disposal
at Area VI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reasonable Alternatives to be Considered Include: No action, deep well injection, and relocation of the Area VI Brine
Storage Lake.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant Issues to be Addressed in the DSEIS Include: The potential impact of decreased chloride concentrations
in the Red River Basin on primary production and sport fish abundance in Lake Texoma, impacts on Federally listed threatened
and/or endangered species, changes in land use at the Area VI disposal site, and any changes in fish and wildlife mitigation
requirements resulting from the noted changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A scoping meeting is not planned, however, a news release informing the public and local, state, and Federal agencies
of the proposed action will be published in local newspapers. Comments received as a result of this notice and the news
release will be used to assist the Tulsa District in identifying potential impacts to the quality of the human or natural
environments. Affected Federal, state, or local agencies, affected Indian tribes, and other interested private
organizations and parties may participate in the scoping process by forwarding written comments to the above noted
address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DSEIS is expected to be available for public review and comment by June 1994. Any comments and suggestions should
be forwarded to the above noted address no later than 1 May 1994 to be considered in the DSEIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
For reasons set forth in the summary and under the authority of DOD Directives 5126.9 and 4500.34 this revision will
supersede in part the current procedures published in DOD 4500.34&hyph;R, Chapter 2, Personal Property Traffic
Management Regulation; the TQAP pamphlet, dated February 1992; and the CONUS Automated Rates System pamphlet, dated
1 May 1991. The proposed revisions were initially published for comments in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

were received in writing and telephonically during the review of the program, September 1993 through January 1994.
There were 12 individual letter responses to the September 1993

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 item. This also included letters from carrier association/bureau. Some changes were made to the proposed revisions
based on the comments received. The significant changes contained in the revision are as follows and will apply in
lieu of cited TQAP pamphlet, DOD 4500.34R, and CARTS paragraphs:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Carriers will provide a copy of the DD Form 1840, Joint Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery, to the origin PPSO
within 75 calendar days of delivery of the shipment. The PPSO will sign and return by mail a receipt if a self addressed
stamped card or letter of transmittal is included by the carrier. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph C.4.c.(8) and
DOD 4500.34R, page A&hyph;23, para 52.e.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of freight forwarders oppose this change, while the van line carriers prefer to send the form to origin
or have no preference. Most of the carriers commented that they believe the service member should be responsible for
returning the form to a PPSO. The DOD strongly believes it is necessary to cut out the middle-man in the processing of
the DD Form 1840. This will lighten the administrative burden on the PPSOs and the carrier industry as well. In addition
to cutting out the middle man, the time for returning the form has been expanded to accommodate overseas mail. Other
paperwork must be returned to the carrier to show proof of delivery or to ensure payment to the carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. All shipments will be scored within 12 months of pickup date. If no destination information is known, the origin
PPSO will contact the destination PPSO to confirm the status of the shipment and request feedback on carrier performance
at time of delivery. This will also ensure that if the shipment is still in SIT points will not be taken away from the carrier
for not providing a DD Form 1840. Unless there is evidence in the file to show otherwise, these types of shipments will
usually score at 100. In addition, shipments noted as still in SIT 12 months after pickup will be flagged to prevent
them from being scored again in future cycles. (Reference TQAP, page 21, paragraphs C.3.e. and f.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Carriers against the proposal suggested the origin PPSO not make any contact with the destination PPSO for status
on shipments. They would like an automatic score of 100. Again, the DOD believes communication between the origin
and destination PPSO is vital to ensure shipments are scored properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. If the carrier discovers a shipment the PPSO failed to score 12 months after pickup, the carrier must identify the
shipment during the appeal cycle of the DD Form 2497. The shipment will then be scored within 45 days and batch mailed
according to TQAP procedures. This will allow the carrier an opportunity to appeal if necessary. The score will reflect
on the carrier's next semiannual score. (Reference TQAP, page 21, paragraph C.3.g. and page 26, paragraph C.6.e.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments received on this proposal noted the time period allowed to identify these shipments (during the appeal cycle
of the semiannual evaluation) was one of the busiest times for carriers. It was suggested carriers by allowed to identify
these shipments any time up until the next semiannual performance evaluation and possibly up to 12 months longer.
It was also suggested the score should apply to the most recent semiannual score. The DOD believes few shipments will
fall into this category, as carriers have the option of requesting a score 120 days after delivery. The carrier must
have an opportunity to appeal. Consideration was given to allowing only the 100 scores apply to the present cycle as
it is unlikely those scores will have an appeal. However, there may be circumstances where it may benefit the carrier
for the newly scored shipment to go into the next performance cycle. In the interest of fairness to all, each shipment
will retain the right to appeal, and the score applied to the next performance cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. A PPSO has up to 12 months from pickup to score shipments. However, a carrier may request a shipment score 120 days
after delivery when proof of delivery is provided. A completed DD Form 1840/1840R will be the only acceptable proof
of delivery. Origin PPSOs will not be limited to using only origin data for scoring, but must ensure they have received
feedback from destination. (Reference TQAP, pages 20&hyph;21, paragraphs C.3.c. through f.)

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Those submitting negative comments on this issue suggested there was not need for the origin PPSO to contact the destination
PPSO. The DOD believes it is necessary for PPSOs to communicate shipment information prior to scoring to ensure each
carrier is given the score it earned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Unless a shipment is still in SIT, shipments may be scored under 12 months of the pickup date (see note (3) below) if
all of the following criteria exists:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A completed DD Form 1780 (may be electronic data) or destination feedback from the destination PPSO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The DD Form 1840 is present and signed by the member and the carrier representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Shipments that have been converted to nontemporary storage (NTS) or commercial storage will not require a DD Form
1840 for scoring. The destination PPSO should annotate the DD Form 1780 at the time the shipment is converted and return
the form to origin. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph C.5.b.)

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments against the proposal stated if shipments have not been scored within a year, the origin PPSO should not contact
the destination PPSO to get the status of the shipment and the carrier should receive a score of 100. The DOD is making
every attempt to ensure shipments are properly scored. By making it necessary for the origin and destination PPSOs
to communicate there is less chance for an error when scoring a shipment. The DOD has no intention of giving scores of
100 that may not have been earned. This would not be fair to those carriers who do earn them.

F. Carriers will not be required to respond to letters of warning, unless the PPSO specifically requests a written
response. However, if the violations continue the carrier is subject to suspension. (Reference TQAP, pages 6&hyph;7,
paragraph B.3.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comments indicated the PPSOs should ensure carriers are sending the letters of warning by certified mail. TQAP already
requires DD Forms 1814, Letters of Warning, be sent certified mail, return receipt requested.

G. Facsimiles will be permitted to meet the deadline for submitting the DD Form 1840. (Reference TQAP, page 24, paragraph
C.4.c.(8))

Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Carriers were pleased the requirement for a hard copy to follow facsimiles was cancelled as announced at the September
1993, Military Symposium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. On long delivery out of SIT shipments, the carrier will return the completed DD Form 619 to the PPSO that authorized
the services. (Reference TQAP, page 33, paragraph C.10.d.)

 No significant comments. This change will ensure services authorized are confirmed by the proper authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. When a carrier is suspended for a volume move, it is suspended for the same type service (e.g., All domestic HHGs),
for all shipments out of that activity. The CONUS Automated Rate System (CARTS) pamphlet will be changed. (Reference
CARTS Instruction Pamphlet, Page 28, paragraph 6008.c.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No significant comments. This is to bring the CARTS pamphlet in line with the TQAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. Shipments turned back by the carrier, or pulled back by the PPSO due to the carrier's inability to perform, will be
uniformly scored at 40 points. This includes shipments that have been packed and/or picked up by the local agent. The
carrier will continue to be charged administrative weight on the TDR if the shipment is turned back or pulled back seven
days or less before the established pickup date or any time after the shipment has been packed and/or picked up. (Reference
TQAP page 32, paragraph C.9.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No significant comments. In the interest of uniformity and to alleviate confusion in scoring pull back/turn back
shipments, it is believed all such shipments should be scored the same. Shipments pulled back/turned back within
7 days of pickup, must be retendered and often reinventoried, causing more delay in the movement at origin. Therefore,
all these kinds of shipments will be scored the same.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
K. Previous proposal to no longer require a 20-day grace period prior to a regular suspension is being withdrawn at
this time for further review within the DOD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L. Previous proposal allowing destination PPSOs to take action against a carrier, that has a Letter of Intent on file
at the destination installation for outbound service, for inbound/destination performance failures, has been
withdrawn by the DOD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MTMC considered all comments carefully and has decided to implement changes to the quality assurance program as described
above. The DOD considers the changes necessary to ensure quality assurance standards are applied through better
communication and streamlined procedures.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Disposal and Reuse of the Naval Base Charleston,
SC</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of disposal and reuse of the Naval Base
Charleston, South Carolina. This action is being conducted in accordance with the Defense Base Realignment and Closure
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Closure of Naval Base Charleston was recommended by the 1993 Defense Base Realignment and Closure Commission to eliminate
excess naval base berthing capacity while maintaining the overall military value of the remaining bases. The proposed
action to be evaluated in the EIS involves the disposal of land, buildings, and infrastructure of Naval Base Charleston
for subsequent reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy intends to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of Naval Base Charleston based on the reasonably
foreseeable reuse of the property, taking into account uses to be identified by the reuse committee_Building Economic
Solutions Together (BEST). In coordination with the BEST Committee's reuse plan, other federal agencies may offer
uses for the property. The EIS will evaluate alternative reuse concepts of the property, including the ``no action''
alternative, which would be retention of the property by the Navy in caretaker status. However, due to provisions
found in the Base Realignment and Closure Act, selection of the ``no action'' alternative would be considered impractical
for the Navy to implement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will evaluate the impacts of reuse of Naval Base Charleston on the natural environment such as wetlands and
wildlife habitat and on the socioeconomic environment which includes potential impacts to the regional economy,
housing market, public schools, and tax base. The Navy will conduct a cultural resource survey to determine whether
any sensitive archaeological resources exist within the property. Additionally, the Navy is conducting an Environmental
Baseline Survey to determine if any areas of environmental contamination exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy will initiate a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying
the significant issues related to this action. The Navy will hold public scoping meetings at four different locations
as follows: Wednesday, April 27, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Chicora Neighborhood Center at 2012 Success Street,
North Charleston, South Carolina; Wednesday, April 27, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the North Charleston City Hall,
4900 LaCross Road, North Charleston, South Carolina; Thursday, April 28, 1994, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Berkeley
County Office Building, 223 North Live Oak Drive, Moncks Corner, South Carolina; and Thursday, April 28, 1994, beginning
at 7 p.m. at the District 2 Administrative Office Building at 102 Greenwave Boulevard, Summerville, South Carolina.
These meetings will also be advertised in local and regional newspapers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A brief presentation will precede requests for public comment and identification of additional scoping items. Navy
representatives will be available at this meeting to receive comments from the public regarding issues of concern.
It is important that federal, state, and local agencies and interested persons take this opportunity to identify
environmental concerns that should be addressed during preparation of the EIS. In the interest of maximizing the
use of available time, each speaker will be asked to limit his/her oral comments to five minutes.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, the Department of Education publishes this notice of an altered
system of records that consolidates ten existing systems of records maintained under the student financial assistance
programs authorized by title IV, the Higher Education Act, 1965, amended, (HEA). The notice is also expanded to cover
the new Federal Direct Student Loan programs authorized under title IV, HEA. The programs involved in this consolidation
include the Federal Direct Student Loan, Federal Insured Student Loan, Federal Family Education Loan, and Federal
Perkins Loan programs. This system will also maintain records under the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity
Grant and Federal Pell Grant programs that are necessary in the collection of overpayments. Because this system is
being expanded to cover one new program, the Department seeks comments on all of the routine uses contained in this
notice. The name and number of the single consolidated system of records is the Title IV Program File (18&hyph;40&hyph;0024).

Government Operations of the House of Representatives, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on April 6, 1994. This system of records will become effective
after a 40-day period for OMB review of the system expires on May 16, 1994, unless OMB gives specific notice within the
40 days that the system is not approved for implementation or requests additional time for its review. The Department
will publish any changes to the routine uses that are required as a result of the comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Education consolidates into a single system of records ten existing systems that are currently
maintained regarding information authorized to be collected under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (title
IV, HEA), as amended. In addition, the system is expanded to include the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, authorized
to be collected under Part D of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, ten separate systems of records notices notify the public about the existence of data collected under
title IV, HEA. The consolidation of these systems of records will enable the Department to improve the efficiency
of data maintenance by eliminating the administrative burden and duplication associated with the use of separate
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The programs involved in this consolidation include the Federal Direct Student Loan Program; the Federal Family
Education Loan (formerly Guaranteed Student Loan) Program, which includes the: Federal Stafford Loan, Federal
Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Federal SLS, Federal PLUS, and Federal Consolidation Loan Programs; the Federal Insured
Student Loan (FISL) Program; and the Federal Perkins Loan Program (formerly the National Direct Student Loan Program).
This system will also maintain records regarding individuals participating in the Federal Supplemental Educational
Opportunity Grant Program and Federal Pell Grant Program that are necessary for the collection of overpayments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department needs to maintain records regarding certain individuals who have received title IV student financial
assistance for the following purposes: (1) To verify their identity; (2) to determine program eligibility and benefits;
(3) to permit servicing and collecting of the loan or grant; (4) to locate a delinquent or defaulted debtor or to locate
a recipient owing an overpayment on a grant; (5) to counsel the individual in repayment efforts; (6) to investigate
possible fraud; (7) to verify an individual's, or institution or other entity's compliance with program regulations;
and (8) to initiate legal action against an individual, institution, or other entity involved in program fraud or
abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system of records contains numerous technical revisions to the current notice, including one which adds a purpose
clause to the notice to comply with the Office of the Federal Register guidelines. The purpose clause notifies individuals
of the intended use of the information collected in the system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct access is restricted to authorized contract and agency personnel in the performance of their official duties.
Due to the restructuring of the system notice, it is being published in its entirety.

Take notice that New England Power Company (NEP) on March 29, 1994, amended its filing submitted on February 28, 1994
in this docket by requesting a waiver of the 60-day notice requirement which would otherwise prohibit transactions
under Certificate of Concurrence with Central Vermont Public Service, Green Mountain Power Company and The United
Illuminating Company prior to April 29, 1994 under NEP's FERC Electric Tariff, Original Volume No. 6. NEP requests
an effective date of April 1, 1994 for the Certificates of Concurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As good cause for NEP's request, NEP states that Green Mountain Power Company has requested service under the Certificates
of Concurrence commencing April 4, 1994. Absent waiver, NEP will be unable to provide the requested service to Green
Mountain Power Company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on March 17, 1994, Hunt Refining Company (Hunt) and East Mississippi Pipeline Company (East Mississippi),
(referred jointly as Petitioners), filed a request that the Commission exempt the pipeline facilities of Hunt and
East Mississippi from the Commission's jurisdiction on the basis that such facilities are not ``jurisdictional''
within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) but are private, proprietary systems. Petitioners submit
that they are not subject to the filing requirements of sections 6 (schedule of rates and charges), 19(a) (maps and
valuation data), and 20 (annual, periodic, and special reports) of the ICA. In the alternative, petitioners request
that the Commission (a) exempt Hunt and East Mississippi from the filing and reporting requirements which otherwise
would apply, or (b) recognize that Hunt and East Mississippi need not publish a schedule of rates and charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioners state that the facilities for which an exemption is sought are owned entirely by Petitioners and will
be utilized solely to transport crude oil to which Hunt holds title. No other refinery interconnects with the Petitioners'
facilities and, due to the location and service performed by these facilities, requests for access to the facilities
by any third party are extremely unlikely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214
and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April
21, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will
not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference
room.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on April 1, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National), 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo,
New York 14203, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;328&hyph;000 a request pursuant to &sect;&sect;157.205 and 157.212
of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to construct
and operate a delivery point under National's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;4&hyph;000 pursuant
to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National proposes to construct and operate a delivery point located in Ashland Township, Clarion County, Pennsylvania,
for additional deliveries of gas to National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), an existing firm
transportation customer. National states that the total volumes to be delivered is estimated to be 910 Mcf annually.
National indicates that this will have a minimal impact on its peak day and annual deliveries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National states that an emergency tap was installed at the proposed location on February 4, 1994, because seven residential
customers of Distribution were without gas. National explains that the seven customers were out of gas due to frozen
wells and related facilities which previously provided for their needs. On March 24, 1994, Distribution filed for
waiver of the initial time limitation because the wells have not returned to sufficient production. National further
states that it is now seeking authorization under its blanket certificate to assure continuation of service beyond
the expiration of the current emergency authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file
pursuant to rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention
and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on April 1, 1994, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (Niagara), filed a petition to intervene and motion
requesting the Commission to revoke qualifying status of the cogeneration facility owned by Syracuse Power Company
(Syracuse). Syracuse's notice of the self-certification was filed with the Commission on July 9, 1993, in the above-captioned
docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Niagara maintains that certification should be revoked on the ground that the facility failed to meet the Commission's
operating standard during the 1993 calendar year [See, 18 CFR 292.205(a) (1993)]. Niagara alleges that although
the facility began commercial operation on July 26, 1993, and produced power during the year, no useful thermal output
was produced. This, Niagara states was due to the fact that Purity Water Co., Inc., the facility's steam host, was unable
to obtain the necessary permits from the New York State Department of Health Regulations to produce bottled water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or objecting to the granting of qualifying status should file a motion to intervene
or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in
accordance with rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests
must be filed within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and must be served on the applicant. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate
action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party
must file a petition to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public
inspection.

 and the agreement of the parties at the March 8, 1994, technical conference in this proceeding, the Commission's Advisory

that it intends to file certain changes to its tariff based on its first year's experience with its restructured operations.
This conference will provide a forum for the discussion of Transwestern's proposed changes and possibly resolution
of issues that may arise concerning those changes. Since the conference is limited to a consideration of Transwestern's
operations under its restructuring plan, generic changes in Order No. 636 policy will not be discussed.

Midstream Fuel Service, Inc. (Midstream) filed an Application for Exception from the provision of filing Form EIA&hyph;782B,
entitled ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' The exception request, if granted,
would permit Midstream to be exempted from filing Form EIA&hyph;782B. In considering the request, the DOE found that
the firm was suffering a gross inequity due to the maternity leave of two of the firm's employees. On March 15, 1994,
the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order which determined that the exception request be granted in part and that
Midstream should be granted an extension of time until May 1994 in which to file the forms due between February 1, 1994,
and May 1, 1994.

During the week of March 21 through March 25, 1994, the proposed decisions and orders summarized below were issued
by the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy with regard to applications for exception.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedural regulations that apply to exception proceedings (10 CFR part 205, subpart D), any person who
will be aggrieved by the issuance of a proposed decision and order in final form may file a written notice of objection
within ten days of service. For purposes of the procedural regulations, the date of service of notice is deemed to be
the date of publication of this Notice or the date an aggrieved person receives actual notice, whichever occurs first.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedural regulations provide that an aggrieved party who fails to file a Notice of Objection within the time
period specified in the regulations will be deemed to consent to the issuance of the proposed decision and order in
final form. An aggrieved party who wishes to contest a determination made in a proposed decision and order must also
file a detailed statement of objections within 30 days of the date of service of the proposed decision and order. In
the statement of objections, the aggrieved party must specify each issue of fact or law that it intends to contest in
any further proceeding involving the exception matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Farmers Co-Operative Company filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.''
In considering this request, the DOE found that the firm was not suffering a gross inequity or serious hardship. Accordingly,
on March 24, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied.

Friendly Service Stations, Inc., (Friendly) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales
Report.'' Friendly showed that it had been forced by financial difficulties to reduce its staff to such an extent that
complying with the reporting requirement would impose an inordinate burden on the firm. DOE therefore determined
that exception relief should be granted. Friendly hopes that its current difficulties will prove temporary. The
exception relief granted will therefore be effective for a period of nineteen months, ending April 30, 1995. Accordingly,
on March 23, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the request should be granted in part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On January 22, 1992, the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy issued a Decision and Order setting
forth final refund procedures to distribute the monies in the oil overcharge escrow account established in accordance
with the terms of a Consent Order entered into by the Department of Energy and the Strasburger Enterprises, Inc. See
Strasburger Enterprises, Inc., 22 DOE &para; 85,021 (1992), 57 FR 3199 (January 28, 1992). That Decision established
January 29, 1993, as the filing deadline for the submission of refund applications for direct restitution by purchasers
of Strasburger Enterprises, Inc.'s refined petroleum products. 22 DOE at 88,063. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Hearings and Appeals commenced accepting refund applications in the Strasburger Enterprises, Inc.
refund proceeding on February 18, 1992, more than two years ago. All of the Applications for Refund filed in the Strasburger
Enterprises, Inc. proceeding have been considered and resolved. Furthermore, in view of the extended period of time
that has transpired since the commencement of the proceeding, and the fact that no Applications for Refund have been
submitted since February 2, 1993, we have concluded that all eligible applicants have been provided with ample time
to file. Accordingly, effective April 22, 1994, the proceeding established to distribute funds from the escrow account
maintained pursuant to the consent order entered into between the DOE and Strasburger Enterprises, Inc. will be closed.
Any unclaimed funds remaining will be made available for indirect restitution pursuant to the Petroleum Overcharge
Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. 4501.

see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 68,903 (December 29, 1993)) that the DOE has formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $610,000, plus accrued
interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into with J.R. Cone on May 14, 1993. The funds
were paid by Cone towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE price and allocation regulations involving
the sale of crude oil during the period from November 1973 through February 1977. The DOE is currently holding the funds
in an interest bearing account pending distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has determined to distribute the Cone Consent Order funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement
of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP,
crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined
petroleum products. Refunds to the states will be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum
products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers will be based on the volume of petroleum
products they purchased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for Refund must be postmarked no later than June 30, 1994. As we state in the Decision, any party who has
previously filed an Application for Refund in the crude oil refund proceedings should not file another Application
for Refund. The previously filed crude oil application will be deemed filed in all crude oil proceedings as the procedures
are finalized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute
funds which J.R. Cone (Cone) remitted to the DOE pursuant to a Consent Order entered into by Cone and the DOE on May 14,
1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1983, the OHA issued a Remedial Order (RO) finding that Cone had erroneously classified crude oil produced
from two oil bearing properties as crude oil produced from stripper well properties. On May 14, 1993, Cone and the DOE
entered into a Consent Order settling all claims arising from the RO. Pursuant to the Consent Order, Cone has remitted
$610,000 to the DOE. These funds have been held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department
of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 C.F.R. part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requested
in its petition that the OHA establish special refund procedures to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violations
which were resolved by the Consent Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.

I. Jurisdiction and Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan for distributing funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds, see the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C.

II. The Proposed Decision and Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We considered the ERA's petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the Cone Consent Order fund
and determined that such a proceeding was appropriate. On December 20, 1993, we issued a Proposed Decision and Order
(PDO) setting forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
58 Fed. Reg. 68,903 (December 29, 1993). In the PDO, we stated our intent to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund
procedures, as set out below, to distribute the funds obtained through the Cone Consent Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PDO provided a period of 30 days from the date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for interested parties to file comments regarding the tentative distribution process. More than 30 days has elapsed
and the OHA has received no comments on the proposed distribution process for the Consent Order funds. Consequently,
the procedures will be adopted as proposed.

A. Crude Oil Refund Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We adopt the tentative determination of the PDO to distribute the funds obtained with the Cone Consent Order in accordance
with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 Fed. Reg. 27899 (August 4, 1986)(The
MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement).
The MSRP establishes that 40% of the crude oil funds will be remitted to the Federal government, another 40% to the states,
and up to 20% may be initially reserved for payment of claims to injured parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies
remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be disbursed to the Federal government and the states
in equal amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 Fed. Reg. 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for filing
of comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund
proceedings. Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it had received
pursuant to the Order Implementing the MSRP. This notice was published at 52 Fed. Reg. 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April
10 Notice).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude
oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase
volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981, crude oil price control period,
and (2) show that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum
products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged
crude oil overcharges. End-users, therefore, need only submit documentation of their purchase volumes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See City of Columbus, Georgia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
16 DOE &para; 85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that we would calculate crude oil refunds on a per gallon (or volumetric)
basis. We obtained this figure by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption of petroleum products
in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund procedures outlined
in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases.

B. Refund Claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We adopt the PDO's proposed determination to use the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the
monies in the Cone Consent Order fund. We have chosen to reserve 20% of the fund, $122,000, plus accrued interest, for
direct refunds to claimants in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims filed in this proceeding in a manner consistent with our previous crude
oil refund proceedings under Subpart V. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See Mountain Fuel, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
14 DOE at 88,869. Claimants in this proceeding will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products
and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged overcharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We adopt a presumption that the crude oil overcharges were absorbed, rather than passed on, by applicants which were
(1) end-users of petroleum products, (2) unrelated to the petroleum industry, and (3) not subject to the regulations
promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;751&hyph;760h
(1988). Under this presumption, end-user claimants need not submit documentation to show injury, and may become
eligible for a refund by simply documenting their purchase volumes.

As we have stated in prior Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant need only submit one application for its share of
all available crude oil overcharge funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
15 DOE &para; 85,495 (1987). A party that has already submitted a claim in any other crude oil refund need not file another
claim. The prior application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings finalized to date. The DOE
has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
58 Fed. Reg. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per
gallon. While we anticipate that the applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988, will receive a supplemental
refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional
refunds.

Under the Privacy Act of 1974, the submission of a social security number by an individual applicant is voluntary.
An applicant that does not wish to submit a social security number must submit an employer identification number if
one exists. This information will be used in processing refund applications, and is requested pursuant to our authority
under the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &sect;4502(b)(1) (1988), and
the regulations codified at 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V. The information may be shared with other Federal agencies for
statistical, auditing or archiving purposes, and with law enforcement agencies when they are investigating a potential
violation of civil or criminal law. Unless an Applicant claims confidentiality, this information will be available
to the public in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award on a noncompetitive basis a cooperative agreement
to Pen Kem, Inc. The cooperative agreement is a continuation of work under a former DOE cooperative agreement and will
support development of the active ultrasonic spectroscopy for shape characterization efforts which began in 1991
as a part of the PSD sensor project. DOE support is estimated at $150,000 for a twelve month period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The anticipated objectives to be achieved include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Development of methodology to infer shape characteristics using ultrasonic response measured under various imposed
flow fields;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Design and fabrication of an R&amp;D prototype slurry characterization chamber (SCC); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Valuation of key concepts using model systems (specially prepared clays with controlled shape variations) in the
laboratory and experimental evaluation of proposed techniques for monitoring delamination of kaolin will be conducted
to identify practical limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The probability of success is high because of Pen Kem's experience and continued work with R&amp;D in the field of colloids.
Since the development of the new PSD sensor prototype, development of a new PSD sensor based on ultrasound has been
reported in Europe. Preliminary market exploration of the commercial PSD instrument was conducted at the 1992 Pen
Kem User's forum in Paris in November 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishments during the initial phase of the project indicate that Pen Kem will successfully achieve these objectives
with continued DOE funding and that competition for support would result in considerable delay in achieving some
of the results anticipated during the upcoming phase of the project as well as inhibit the objectives of the Office
of Conservation Energy. Award is therefore restricted to Pen Kem, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of the project is to develop a material marking and tracking system and a process planning and scheduling
system suitable for use in a steel plant. These systems are part of a larger effort to provide a comprehensive Integrated
Manufacturing Information System (IMIS). The renewal award will continue with Phase II tasks. DOE has no recent,
current, or planned solicitations under which this proposal would be eligible. The activity to be funded is necessary
to the satisfactory continuation of an activity currently funded by DOE and for which competition for support would
have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the project. Anticipated project benefits include
energy savings, economic benefits, and environmental enhancement. The renewal award will be for two years at a total
estimated cost of $9,137,433 per year. Weirton must cost share at least 50% of the project costs and DOE obligations
will not exceed amounts authorized for this project. DOE has $2,912,000 available for FY 94 and expects a similar amount
for FY 95. Statutory authority for this award is Public Law 93&hyph;577, Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and
Development Act of 1974. The Federal Domestic Catalog Number is 81.078.

The Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office of Health and Environmental Assessment, of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) is undertaking to update and revise, where appropriate, EPA's air quality criteria for particulate
matter (PM) under sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since completion of the 1982 criteria document for particulate matter and sulfur oxides (and its 1986 addendum),
EPA has continued to follow the scientific literature and compile information that may be relevant to a review of the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM. Interested parties are invited to assist EPA in developing and refining
its scientific information base to help ensure that all relevant information is considered in updating the air quality
criteria for PM. Identification of new information in the following areas will be particularly useful: Effects of
exposure on laboratory animals and humans; effects on vegetation, agroecosystems (crops), and natural ecosystems;
effects on nonbiological materials; effects on global climate; chemistry and physics; sources and emissions; analytical
methodology; transformation and transport in the environment; and ambient concentrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be considered for inclusion in the criteria document, submitted information should have been published, accepted
for publication, or presented at a public scientific meeting.

Highway, Suite 906, Arlington, VA will assist the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT) in processing
export notices submitted under section 12(b) of TSCA and issuing notification letters to foreign governments. In
accordance with 40 CFR 2.306(j), EPA has determined that under EPA contract number 68&hyph;D4&hyph;0007, GCI will
require access to CBI submitted to EPA under sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 12 of TSCA to perform successfully the duties specified
under the contract. Access is required for sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 of TSCA in addition to section 12 because certain regulatory
actions under those sections trigger section 12 export notices. GCI personnel will be given access to information
submitted to EPA under section 12 of TSCA. Some of the information may be claimed or determined to be CBI.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is issuing this notice to inform all submitters of information under section 12 of TSCA that EPA may provide GCI
access to these CBI materials on a need-to-know basis only. All access to TSCA CBI under this contract will take place
at EPA Headquarters and at GCI's Technical Assistance Information Service (TAIS) office, Waterside Mall, Garage
Level, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before access to TSCA CBI is authorized at GCI's TAIS office site, EPA will approve GCI's security certification statement,
perform the required inspection of its facility, and ensure that the facility is in compliance with the manual. Upon
completing review of the CBI materials, GCI will return all transferred materials to EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clearance for access to TSCA CBI under this contract may continue until September 30, 1998. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GCI personnel will be required to sign nondisclosure agreements and will be briefed on appropriate security procedures
before they are permitted access to TSCA CBI.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first meeting will be the Commission's Alternative Assessment Committee. The purpose of the meeting will be the
finalization of a request for proposals (RFP) to be issued to perform the overall assessment of the emission management
options and scenarios. The meeting will be closed to the general public. This action is being taken to ensure that potential
bidders on the assessment are not given an unfair advantage by attending this meeting. A bidders conference will be
held at a later date as part of the RFP process to ensure bidders have an opportunity to gain a full understanding of the
assessment needs.

The second set of meetings will be the Commission's Aerosol and Visibility, Modeling, Meteorology, and Emissions
Subcommittees. The Aerosol and Visibility Subcommittee main agenda items will be to establish the bounds of natural
background visibility distributions in the transport region, and update other work plan tasks. The Modeling Subcommittee's
agenda will focus on reviewing proposed modeling protocols. The Meteorology Subcommittee's primary agenda items
will be to compare back-trajectory model results and to develop a synoptic characterization for the years 1982&hyph;1992
for the Grand Canyon region. The Emissions Subcommittee, finally, will focus on approving the 1990 emissions inventory,
and work on micro and future base inventories. The subcommittee meetings are open to the public.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would permit Martin Marietta, a Maryland-based
corporation, to acquire General Dynamics Corporation's Space Systems Division and would prohibit, among other
things, the respondent's Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) division from disclosing to its satellite division any
non-public information that its ELV division receives from a satellite manufacturer, and would require the respondent
to give a copy of the final consent order to U.S. satellite owners or manufacturers before obtaining any non-public
information from them.

Agreement Containing Consent Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission''), having initiated an investigation of the acquisition by Martin
Marietta Corporation (``Martin Marietta''), of certain assets of the Space Systems Division of General Dynamics
Corporation (``General Dynamics''), and it now appearing that Martin Marietta, hereinafter sometimes referred
to as proposed respondent, is willing to enter into an agreement containing an order to refrain from certain acts and
to provide for other relief:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby agreed by and between proposed respondent, by its duly authorized officers and attorneys, and counsel
for the Commission that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed respondent Martin Marietta is a corporation, organized, existing, and doing business under and by virtue
of the laws of the State of Maryland, with its office and principal place of business located at 6801 Rockledge Drive,
Bethesda, Maryland 20817.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of complaint here attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Proposed respondent waives: a. Any further procedural steps;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant
to this agreement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. This agreement shall not become a part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the
Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission it, together with the draft of complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60) days and information in respect thereto publicly
released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed
respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided, however, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
if, prior to the date the Commission issues its complaint and decision, proposed respondent notifies the Commission
in writing that it has abandoned its proposed acquisition as described in the draft of complaint and has withdrawn
any related notifications filed pursuant to Section 7A of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18a, the Commission
will not issue its complaint and decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint here attached, or that the facts as alleged in the draft
complaint, other than jurisdictional facts, are true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn
by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules, and if proposed respondent
has not notified the Commission that it has abandoned its proposed acquisition pursuant to paragraph 4 of this agreement,
the Commission may, without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form
and substance with the draft of complaint here attached and its decision containing the following order to refrain
from certain acts in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information public with respect thereto. When so
entered, the order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner
and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery
by the U.S. Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order to proposed respondent's
address as stated in this agreement shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to
any other manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding,
representation or interpretation not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the
terms of the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed respondent has read the draft of complaint and order contemplated hereby. Proposed respondent understands
that once the order has been issued, it will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the order. Proposed respondent further understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the
amount provided by law for each violation of the order after it becomes final.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has provisionally accepted an agreement containing a proposed Consent
Order from Martin Marietta Corporation (``Martin Marietta''), under which Martin Marietta's satellite division
would be prohibited from gaining access to any non-public information that Martin Marietta's expendable launch
vehicle division receives from competing satellite producers in its capacity as a provider of launch vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Martin Marietta is a significant competitor in the market for the manufacture and sale of satellites. On December
22, 1993, Martin Marietta agreed to acquire General Dynamics Corporation's Space Systems Division, which manufactures
the Atlas expendable launch vehicles. Following this acquisition, Martin Marietta would be the only United States
supplier in the market for Atlas-class expendable launch vehicles as well as a competitor in the satellite market.
The proposed complaint alleges that the acquisition, if consummated, would violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, and Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, because Martin
Marietta's satellite division could gain access to competitively significant and non-public information concerning
other satellite suppliers' products. As a result, the proposed acquisition increases the likelihood that competition
between satellite suppliers would decrease and that advancements in satellite research, innovation, and quality
would be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Consent Order prohibits Martin Marietta from disclosing any non-public information Martin Marietta
receives in its capacity as a provider of expendable launch vehicles from a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin
Marietta's satellite division. Under the proposed Order, Martin Marietta may only use such information in its capacity
as a provider of expendable launch vehicles. Non-public information is defined in the Order as any information not
in the public domain furnished by a satellite owner or manufacturer to Martin Marietta's expendable launch vehicle
division or General Dynamics in their capacity as providers of expendable launch vehicles and designated as proprietary
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission anticipates that the effect of the proposed Order will be to maintain the opportunity for full competition
in the market for the research, development, manufacture and sale of satellites by limiting the ability of one significant
competitor to use information obtained from other competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the provisions of the Consent Order, Martin Marietta is also required to deliver a copy of the Order to any United
States satellite owner or manufacturer prior to obtaining any information that is outside the public domain. One
year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Martin Marietta will be required
to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.

Dissenting Statement of Commissioner Deborah K. Owen on Proposed Consent Agreement With Martin Marietta Corp. File
No. 941&hyph;0038
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent Martin Marietta Corporation manufactures satellites, which are launched into orbit by expendable launch
vehicles, some of which it also manufactures. It proposes to acquire the Space Systems Division of General Dynamics
Corporation, which manufactures Atlas-class expendable launch vehicles. The theory of the complaint is that if
this acquisition is consummated, Martin Marietta's launch vehicle division will gain access to trade secrets concerning
the products of other satellite manufacturers, and will transfer such information to Martin Marietta's satellite
division, which will use it to injure its competitors. The Commission's order would enjoin Martin Marietta from misusing
its rivals' confidential information in this manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vertical integration, and combinations designed to achieve the efficiencies of such integration, are common phenomena,
particularly in the aerospace industry. Accordingly, it would seem that there are already ample opportunities for
the sort of abusive information-sharing which concerns the Commission. However, equally common are contractual
obligations between vertically integrated companies, and firms that do business with one of their divisions, to
prevent the sharing of those firms' confidential business information with other parts of the conglomerate with
which they compete. The question then is whether such contracts are sufficient to avoid any competitive problem,
or whether government-imposed requirements are necessary; if there exists a significant number of substantiated
incidents of such activity, then private agreements would not seem adequate. However, the opposite appears to be
the case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While various Commission personnel have, in recent years, exhorted the business community to be sensitive to antitrust
concerns stemming from the sharing of business information, Commission enforcement actions in this area have been
rare, and no case has involved the strategic misuse of proprietary information so as to injure a competitor. Furthermore,
Martin Marietta currently manufactures both satellites and launch vehicles, and is already privy to competitively
significant information from other satellite manufacturers, yet I am unaware of any instance where it has been alleged
that proprietary information has been used for exclusionary purposes by Martin Marietta, or indeed by any other aerospace
manufacturer. As a result, it seems fair to conclude that contractual obligations prohibiting such behavior, coupled
with the threat of business tort and treble-damage antitrust suits, are sufficient deterrents. Moreover, as the
amount of available business in the aerospace industry continues to dwindle, it is hard to imagine that developing
a reputation for abusing confidential information would enhance any company's competitiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's proposed consent is somewhat puzzling in its coverage. If the theory of the complaint is correct_that
Martin Marietta's dominant power in the launch vehicle market would facilitate anticompetitive information-sharing
in the satellite market_why would the company stop there? The theory would seem to support as well allegations of other
exclusionary and tying practices, yet these are not included. The Commission, correctly I believe, concluded that
there was no evidence to support such charges; I therefore find it strange that it chose to go forward on the equally
speculative information-sharing allegations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, I do not believe that the evidence supports the theory behind the Commission's complaint, nor that a Commission
order would be superior to privately negotiated confidentiality agreements for protecting the trade secrets of
satellite manufacturers. I dissent.

Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as implemented by the Council
on Environmental Quality (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), the General Services Administration (GSA) has filed with
the Environmental Protection Agency, and made available to other government and private bodies, the Final Environmental
Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the proposed construction of the United States Secret
Service (USSS) Headquarters Building in Washington, DC. The USSS participated as a cooperating agency during preparation
of the Final EA pursuant to 40 CFR 1501.6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of a revised Compliance Policy Guide (CPG)
7126.33 entitled ``Action Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds.'' The CPG revises the action levels for aflatoxins
in peanut products intended for animal feed use (i.e., peanuts, peanut meal, peanut hulls, peanut skins, and ground
peanut hay) and provides guidance on levels of aflatoxin contamination of peanut products intended for use in animal
feeds which, in the agency's view, may be necessary to support a charge of adulteration under certain provisions of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). FDA is inviting public comment concerning the revised action levels
for peanut products that contain aflatoxins and that are shipped in interstate commerce for use in animal feeds.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's use of action levels is defined in &sect;509.4(c)(1) (21 CFR 509.4(c)(1)) of FDA's regulations governing unavoidable
contaminants in animal food and food-packaging material. FDA is announcing that it has revised CPG 7126.33 ``Action
Levels for Aflatoxins in Animal Feeds'' to reflect changes in the action levels for aflatoxins in peanut products
intended for animal feed use, in accordance with &sect;509.4(c)(2), and to provide guidance on levels of aflatoxin
contamination of peanut products. FDA is inviting public comment on the revised action levels for aflatoxins in peanut
products shipped in interstate commerce and intended for certain food-producing animals. The revised action levels
are: (1) 100 parts per billion (ppb) aflatoxins for peanut products intended for breeding beef cattle, breeding swine,
or mature poultry; (2) 200 ppb aflatoxins for peanut products intended for finishing swine (i.e., 100 pounds or greater);
and (3) 300 ppb aflatoxins for peanut products intended for finishing (i.e., feedlot) beef cattle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original 20 ppb action level remains unchanged for aflatoxins in peanut products for use by immature animals,
dairy animals, and for aflatoxins in peanut products for which the intended use is not known (CPG 7126.33). Both the
revised action levels and the one that remains unchanged were the subject of a memorandum that FDA's Associate Commissioner
for Regulatory Affairs issued on December 7, 1990, to the FDA field offices (hereinafter referred to as the December
7, 1990, memorandum) (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aflatoxins are added poisonous or added deleterious substances which, depending upon their level in food or feed,
may cause the food or feed to be adulterated under section 402(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1)). This section
states that a food (or feed) is deemed to be adulterated if it bears or contains an added poisonous or deleterious substance
``which may render [the food (or feed)] injurious to health.'' If the government charges such a violation of the act,
the government must show that there is a reasonable possibility of harm. Thus the action levels for aflatoxin are intended
to represent levels of contamination above which, in the agency's view, the government could satisfy the ``may render
it injurious'' test under section 402(a)(1) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available scientific data, the agency believes that consumption of products containing aflatoxins in excess
of 20 ppb may be injurious to the health of humans and immature animals, and that if such products are fed to dairy cattle,
aflatoxin residues in fluid milk products that approach 0.5 ppb, the current action level for aflatoxin residues
in such products (CPG 7106.10), may result. In 1989, FDA published revised action levels for aflatoxin in corn intended
for use in animal feed (Ref. 2). FDA revised the action levels, which appear in CPG 7126.33, because it was able to further
define subgroups for which levels of aflatoxin greater than 20 ppb may be necessary to support a ``may be injurious
to health'' charge of adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act. Thus, for finishing swine, aflatoxin levels
in excess of 200 ppb can support the charge, while levels above 300 ppb aflatoxin in corn and peanut products can support
a charge under section 402(a)(1) of the act when the corn or peanut products are intended for finishing (i.e., feedlot)
beef cattle. For breeding beef cattle, breeding swine, and mature poultry, corn and peanut products containing aflatoxin
in excess of 100 ppb aflatoxin can support the adulteration charge. Furthermore, FDA concluded from its evaluation
that meat and eggs from these animals would not contain increased residues of aflatoxin. For immature animals and
dairy cows, aflatoxin levels in excess of 20 ppb can support the adulteration charge. For all other species and commodities
the action level remains at 20 ppb until revisions to CPG 7126.33 are warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In deciding to revise the action levels for aflatoxin in peanut products, FDA relied on the data in the support paper
entitled ``Background Paper to Support Action Levels for Aflatoxin-Contaminated Corn'' (Ref. 2). Based on this
information, FDA concluded that the inclusion of aflatoxin-contaminated peanut products in animal feed at the revised
action levels would have a negligible effect on the tissue residue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency has adopted and will use the revised action levels as a basis for guiding its enforcement of
section 402(a)(1) of the act, provided FDA is assured that peanut products in interstate commerce that contain more
than 20 ppb aflatoxin are destined for the appropriate subgroups of animals. Without such assurance, the agency may
conclude that the peanut products could be destined for humans, immature animals, or dairy cattle and, if it bears
or contains more than 20 ppb aflatoxin, FDA believes that the Government would probably prevail in an enforcement
action charging adulteration under section 402(a)(1) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 7, 1990, memorandum (Ref. 1) the agency recognized that all action levels, including those for aflatoxins,
must be viewed and used as guidance rather than a definitive enforcement standard. The agency's action levels are
not binding on the courts, the public (including food producers), or the agency. (See 55 FR 20782 (May 21, 1990).) There
may be situations where circumstances warrant enforcement action at levels below an action level or where enforcement
action is not warranted even though an action level is exceeded. In considering enforcement action where aflatoxin
levels are below the pertinent action level, FDA field offices must take into account the agency's ability to support
the adulteration charge that will be included in the complaint. If a field office believes that enforcement action
is warranted at levels below an action level, then the recommendation for enforcement action should include all compelling
reasons for pursuing such action. Similar consideration is required if a field office believes that enforcement
action where aflatoxin levels are above pertinent action levels is not warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statements made in CPG 7126.33 are not intended to bind the courts, the public, or FDA or to create or confer any rights,
privileges, immunities, or benefits on or for any private person, but are intended merely for internal FDA guidance.

-dioxins (PCDD's) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF's) that was issued by the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). FDA agrees with EPA's decision to refer this issue to FDA
because, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), FDA has authority to take appropriate action to
ensure that paper and paperboard intended for food-contact use are safe. This notice sets out the various options
that FDA is considering regarding the issue of PCDD and PCDF contamination of bleached food-contact paper products
and encourages interested persons to submit pertinent data and other comments on this issue.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
PCDD's and PCDF's are formed in trace amounts as byproducts of certain chemical processes, such as bleaching of paper,
incineration, and manufacturing of certain chlorinated phenols. They are generally produced as a complex mixture
of related compounds or congeners. The PCDD's and PCDF's are classes of 75 and 135 congeners, respectively, the most
toxic of which is 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD has been shown to be a potent animal carcinogen, and EPA has classified it as a ``probable human
carcinogen.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assess the hazards of mixtures of PCDD's and PCDF's, scientists have agreed on the use of international
toxicity equivalency factors to express the comparative toxicity of these chemicals as fractions of the toxicity
of TCDD, the most toxic and most studied congener of the group (Ref. 1). This system expresses the amount of PCDD's and
PCDF's present in terms of TCDD toxic equivalents and estimates the risk for a mixture as if it were one chemical compound.
Under this system, 2,3,7,8-dibenzofuran (TCDF), the most potent of the PCDF's, has been assessed a TCDD toxic equivalency
of 0.1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the occurrence of low levels of PCDD's and PCDF's in the environment has been known for years, it has been only
recently that scientists' ability to identify and quantify them has greatly improved. Based on data obtained in studies
carried out in several countries, the average person is exposed to approximately 1.2 picograms (pg) (10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 grams) of TCDD equivalents/kilogram (kg) body weight/day (Ref. 2). This low level background exposure is mostly
dietary, from foods such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, and eggs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, results of EPA's National Dioxin Study showed that fish located downstream from paper mills had higher than
expected levels of TCDD and TCDF. This finding prompted EPA and the American Paper Institute (API) to conduct a joint
study of five paper mills to discover the source of the TCDD and TCDF contamination. The results of this study: (1) Confirmed
the presence of parts per trillion (ppt) levels of TCDD and TCDF in pulp and sludge; (2) confirmed parts per quadrillion
(ppq) levels of these substances in wastewater from these mills; and (3) identified a particular chlorine bleaching
process as the source of the contaminants. Chlorine or chlorine derivatives are often used as the primary bleaching
agent in the process of making bleached paper products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These results prompted FDA to begin its own investigation of TCDD and TCDF contamination of wood pulp and finished
paper products that may contact food and ultimately migrate into the packaged food. Because the bulk of the TCDD toxic
equivalents associated with PCDD and PCDF contamination of bleached food-contact paper products are attributable
to the presence of TCDD and TCDF, FDA's investigation has focused on the levels of these two chemicals in bleached food-contact
paper products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 24, 1987, FDA met with representatives of the National Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement
(NCASI) to discuss protocols for analyzing for residual TCDD and TCDF levels in bleached wood pulp and in various food-contact
paper products. Under these protocols, newly developed, highly sensitive analytical methods were used by individual
pulp mills to identify those specific processes that contributed to the formation of TCDD and TCDF so that industry
could identify manufacturing changes that could be made to reduce or eliminate such contaminants in the finished
paper products. FDA also asked industry representatives to conduct extraction studies to measure the extent of migration
of TCDD and TCDF from uncoated and coated paper and paperboard into food simulating solvents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May of 1988, NCASI released a report entitled ``Assessment of the Risks Associated with Potential Exposure to Dioxin
Through Consumption of Coffee Brewed Using Bleached Paper Coffee Filters'' (Ref. 3). This study was conducted because
given the presence of residual dioxin contaminants in bleached paper coffee filters and the high temperature of the
water that is passed through the filters, there appeared to be a high potential for migration of such contaminants
into the brewed coffee. Analysis of 5 different bleached paper coffee filters found measurable levels of TCDD and
TCDF ranging from 2.2 to 6.6 ppt TCDD toxic equivalents in the paper. Migration studies indicated that 65 to 90 percent
of the TCDD equivalents present in the bleached paper coffee filters could migrate into the coffee, depending on brewing
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October of 1988, FDA received the results of a Canadian Government survey that detected TCDD and TCDF in milk packaged
in bleached paper cartons (Ref. 4). TCDD was found in five of eight samples of whole milk packaged in coated, bleached
paper milk cartons at concentrations ranging from 0.014 to 0.056 ppt with an average concentration of 0.038 ppt. TCDF
was found in all eight samples at concentrations ranging from 0.064 to 2.46 ppt (average concentration of 0.98 ppt).
Somewhat higher levels were found in cream packaged in coated, bleached paper milk cartons. Analyses of similar food
products packaged in plastic or glass containers showed at least tenfold lower levels of TCDD and TCDF, which were
most likely a result of background contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the spring of 1989, FDA conducted a survey of milk packaged in bleached paper cartons from five U.S. manufacturers
(Ref. 5). TCDD was found in 4 of 15 samples of whole milk packaged and stored in one-half pint cartons at refrigerated
temperatures for 14 days. The TCDD concentrations, which ranged from 0.02 to 0.07 ppt, were obtained using an analytical
method that could determine amounts at or above 0.02 ppt. TCDF was detected in 7 of 15 samples at levels from 0.14 to 0.62
ppt. The detection limit for TCDF was 0.1 ppt. Because neither TCDD nor TCDF was detected in bulk or nonpackaged milk
collected at the same dairies before being packaged, the results confirm that these contaminants can migrate out
of the bleached paper carton and into the milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of FDA's concern about the potential for exposure to TCDD and TCDF from other bleached paper food-contact
articles, FDA requested that the paper industry provide detailed information that could be used to determine what
other bleached paper articles should be the subject of detailed migration studies. Based on the results of the industry
survey, FDA also requested, in February 1989, that the paper industry develop migration data for those paper food-contact
articles posing the greatest potential for exposure to TCDD and TCDF. In response to this request, the paper industry
submitted the results of migration studies for the following paper articles: (1) Milk cartons (Ref. 6), (2) coffee
filters (Ref. 3), (3) half-and-half (cream) cartons (Ref. 7), (4) orange juice cartons (Ref. 8), (5) coffee cups (Ref.
9), (6) soup cups (Ref. 10), (7) dual-ovenable trays (Ref. 11), (8) plates (Ref. 12), and (9) microwave popcorn bags
(Ref. 13).

In 1990, FDA used data from these migration studies, to develop a quantitative risk assessment for bleached paper
food-contact articles containing TCDD and TCDF residues. The procedures that FDA used in this evaluation were similar
to the methods that the agency has used to examine the risk associated with the presence of minor amounts of carcinogenic
impurities in various food and color additives (see 49 FR 13018, April 2, 1984). This risk evaluation of carcinogenic
contaminants has two aspects: (1) Assessment of dietary exposure to the contaminants from the consumption of the
additive and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to the conditions of probable human exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the exposure data derived from the industry studies described above, FDA considered exposure from
four other bleached paper articles that were not subjected to migration testing (bakery cartons, ice cream cartons,
tea bags, and margarine wrappers). An exposure estimate for each of these articles was derived using an estimated
migration level based on an assumed residue of 17 ppt TCDD equivalents in the paper article (the average level of TCDD
equivalents found to be in paper pulp in a study of 104 paper mills carried out in 1988 and 1989) (Ref. 14). In its exposure
estimates, FDA also considered the types of food that come into contact with paper articles and the amounts of these
types of food that are ingested daily by consumers. Based on the results of the migration studies and migration estimates
as well as food consumption information, FDA estimated the daily intake of TCDD equivalents occurring as a result
of migration into food from bleached paper food-contact articles to be no greater than 0.15 pg/kg body weight/day
(Ref. 14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its 1990 risk assessment, the agency used data from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-year chronic toxicity and oncogenicity study carried out by Kociba et al. (Ref. 15) on TCDD fed to rats to estimate
the upper-bound level of lifetime human risk from exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents resulting from the use of bleached
food-contact paper products. The results of the bioassay on TCDD showed that the material was carcinogenic for rats
under the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increased incidences of hepatocellular
carcinomas and adenomas as well as squamous cell carcinomas of the lung, hard palate, nasal turbinates, and tongue.
FDA's toxicologists further concluded that given the paucity of TCDD bioassay data, the Kociba et al. bioassay provided
the appropriate basis on which to calculate an estimate of the upper-bound level of lifetime carcinogenic risk from
exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents stemming from the use of bleached food-contact paper products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency used a linear-at-low-dose extrapolation from the doses used in the Kociba et al. bioassay to the very low
levels of TCDD toxic equivalents encountered under actual conditions of use of bleached food-contact paper products.
This procedure is not likely to underestimate the actual risk from very low doses and may, in fact, exaggerate it because
the extrapolation models used are designed to estimate the maximum risk consistent with the data. Using a linear-at-low-dose
extrapolation method and the tumor incidence data based on the original classification of tumors found in the Kociba
et al. study, the FDA estimated a carcinogenic unit risk of 16 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for an intake of 1 pg/kg body weight/day of TCDD toxic equivalents. Using this carcinogenic risk for TCDD and a daily
dietary exposure of 0.15 pg of TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day (based on data obtained from 1988 to 1990), FDA's
1990 risk assessment estimated that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents
that result from the use of bleached food-contact paper products at that time would be 2.5 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or 2.5 in 1 million (Ref. 16). Because of the conservative assumptions used to obtain the exposure estimate, actual
lifetime-averaged individual exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents is expected to be substantially less than the estimated
daily intake, and therefore, the actual risk would be less than the calculated upper-bound limit of risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This risk was considered low by both FDA and EPA (December 26, 1990, 55 FR 53047). However, because the then current
levels of PCDD's and PCDF's (mostly TCDD and TCDF) in bleached white paper were capable of being reduced by the pulp
and paper industry through changes in manufacturing procedures, EPA considered the risk associated with PCDD's
and PCDF's in food-contact paper products to be ``unreasonable'' in accordance with section 9(a) of TSCA (55 FR 53047).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has the authority to require the reduction of ``unreasonable'' risk associated with bleached paper products
under section 6(a) of TSCA, which states that EPA may prohibit or limit production of a chemical substance that presents
an ``unreasonable'' risk to human health or the environment. However, under section 9(a) of TSCA, if EPA determines
that the risk can be reduced by an action taken by another agency, it may refer such action to the other agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 26, 1990, EPA announced that under section 9(a) of TSCA, it was referring action to FDA on the use of food-contact
paper products contaminated with PCDD's and PCDF's. Specifically, EPA has requested that FDA do the following: (1)
Assess the risk associated with PCDD and PCDF contaminated bleached food-contact paper products; (2) determine
if this risk may be prevented or reduced by action taken under its own authority, and (3) if so, initiate the appropriate
regulatory action.

II. FDA's Response to EPA's Referral for Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA agrees with EPA's decision to refer the use of bleached food-contact paper products that may be contaminated with
PCDD's and PCDF's (mostly TCDD and TCDF) to FDA because under the act, FDA has the authority to take appropriate regulatory
action to ensure that bleached paper and paperboard intended for food-contact use are safe. At the time that FDA received
this referral, the agency considered whether immediate regulatory action was necessary to ensure the safe use of
bleached food-contact paper products. As stated above, FDA's risk assessment in 1990 of exposure to TCDD and TCDF,
resulting from the use of those types of bleached food-contact paper products that have the greatest potential for
migration of these substances into food, produced an estimated upper-bound worst-case lifetime risk of 2.5 in 1 million.
However, the estimated daily dietary intake used in this risk assessment was based on data obtained from 1988 to 1990.
By the time FDA received the referral, many of the paper mills that make bleached paper had made or were in the process
of making manufacturing changes to reduce or eliminate residual TCDD and TCDF levels in bleached paper intended for
use in contact with food. Therefore, rather than expressing the risk in terms of an average 70-year lifespan, FDA believed
that it was more appropriate to view the carcinogenic risk in terms of yearly exposure during the limited time needed
by the paper industry to complete the manufacturing changes necessary to reduce the levels of such contaminants in
paper products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An upper-bound worst-case lifetime risk of 2.5 in 1 million corresponds to less than 0.04 in 1 million for each year
of exposure. Based on this level of risk per year of exposure, FDA felt at the time that it received the referral that
the continued use of bleached paper and paperboard in contact with food was safe during the time needed by FDA to complete
its evaluation of TCDD and TCDF contamination of bleached food-contact paper products. FDA also felt at that time
that it should conduct a new lifetime risk assessment in light of the changes in the manufacturing of bleached food-contact
paper products that had occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the cooperation that FDA had received from the paper industry, FDA decided that it was appropriate to explore
voluntary avenues for reducing exposure to PCDD's and PCDF's from the use of bleached paper and paperboard. At a meeting
held on November 16, 1990, API advised FDA that 100 percent of the U.S. manufacturers of bleached paper for food-contact
applications were participating in a voluntary program to reduce TCDD levels in all types of food-contact paper products
to 2 ppt or less. In a letter of March 7, 1991, API submitted data to FDA showing that all bleached paper milk cartons manufactured
since July 30, 1990, had residual TCDD levels of 2 ppt or less (Ref. 17). API also informed FDA that 93 percent of bleached
food-contact paper and paperboard met the 2 ppt or less TCDD standard as of December 31, 1991, and that 98 percent of
these products were expected to meet this standard by the end of 1992 (Ref. 18). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA), formed by the recent merger of API with other forest related associations,
has submitted to FDA the results of an industry-wide survey conducted during the first quarter of 1993 to determine
the degree of compliance with the voluntary specification of 2 ppt or less of residual TCDD in bleached food-contact
paper products (Ref. 19). These results show that all of the U.S. manufacturers responding to the survey have implemented
standard operating procedures that result in bleached food-contact paper products that meet the voluntary specification
of 2 ppt or less of TCDD. Out of 249 tests conducted on samples of either bleached pulp, paper, or paperboard, only 3 samples
had detectable levels of TCDD that were above 2 ppt (i.e., 2.1 ppt, 2.2 ppt, and 2.6 ppt). The levels of TCDD that were
found to be above 2 ppt in the survey are likely to be the result of normal variability associated with both the methodology
used to analyze for the TCDD and the manufacturing procedures used to produce the bleached paper products. Moreover,
although the paper industry's voluntary program specifically deals with residual levels of TCDD in bleached food-contact
paper products, industry data have shown that the manufacturing changes that have resulted in the significant reduction
of TCDD in such products also have resulted in a corresponding decrease in TCDF (Ref. 17). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, FDA also conducted its own analysis of uncoated bleached paper destined for use in milk cartons (Ref. 20) to
confirm whether it meets the voluntary specification of 2 ppt or less of TCDD. These tests used analytical methodology
developed by FDA's Chicago District Laboratory (Ref. 21). FDA collected samples in late 1991 and early 1992 from five
U.S. manufacturers that produce over 90 percent of the domestic paper stock used for milk cartons. Paper stock from
two of the manufacturers contained very low levels of TCDD (1.4 and 1.5 ppt, respectively) and TCDF (4.0 and 4.7 ppt,
respectively). Residual levels of TCDD and TCDF could not be detected in the paper stock from the other three manufacturers
using an analytical method sensitive to 1 ppt for TCDD and 2 ppt for TCDF. These results support the paper industry's
claim that the bleached paper used to manufacture milk cartons is in compliance with a voluntary specification of
2 ppt for TCDD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has also recently completed an analysis of milk samples contained in cartons manufactured using bleached paper
(Ref. 22). Fifteen milk samples were collected in late 1991 and early 1992 from dairies that use bleached paper from
the five major U.S. manufacturers. None of the samples contained detectable levels of TCDD and TCDF using analytical
methodologies with detection limits in the 2 to 10 ppq range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA has developed a new risk assessment to determine what the current upper-bound lifetime cancer risk
is from exposure to TCDD toxic equivalents resulting from the use of bleached paper and paperboard products meeting
the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt or less of TCDD. In the absence of migration data for bleached
paper products containing such low levels of TCDD (i.e., 2 ppt or less), FDA assumed that the percent migration of TCDD
from a specific type of food-contact article meeting the voluntary 2 ppt TCDD specification would be similar to the
percent migration observed in earlier studies (Ref. 14). Because the percent migration decreases as the level of
the migrant in the food-contact article decreases, this approach is not likely to underestimate migration levels.
Using the above assumption and assuming that all bleached food-contact paper products contain residual levels of
TCDD low enough to meet a 2 ppt TCDD specification, FDA estimates that the upper-bound daily dietary intake of TCDD
toxic equivalents is no greater than 1.8 pg/person/day (0.03 pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day for a 60&hyph;kg
person) (Ref. 23). FDA used this exposure estimate to determine the current upper-bound lifetime cancer risk from
TCDD toxic equivalents resulting from the use of bleached food-contact paper products assuming that virtually all
of such products meet a 2 ppt TCDD specification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The carcinogenic unit risk used by FDA in its 1990 risk assessment was based on tumor incidence data from the Kociba
et al. study (Ref. 15). Following FDA's 1990 risk assessment, however, a group of pathologists, called the Pathology
Working Group (PWG), reanalyzed the slides of the liver tumors observed in the 1978 Kociba rat bioassay using the National
Toxicological Program's 1986 classification system for liver tumors (Ref. 24). FDA has reviewed the results of this
reanalysis and agrees with the classification of the tumors made by PWG. Using the results of this revised reading
of the Kociba study slides, FDA estimates a carcinogenic unit risk of 9 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for an intake of 1 pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day. Using this carcinogenic unit risk and an upper-bound daily
dietary exposure estimate of 0.03 pg TCDD equivalents/kg body weight/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit
of individual lifetime cancer risk from TCDD toxic equivalents would be 3 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the use of bleached food-contact paper products meeting a 2 ppt TCDD specification (Ref. 25).

The agency obtained this 3 x 10

 risk estimate by assuming that the lifetime cancer risk from TCDD would be equal in mammalian species, such as in man
and in rodents when the daily feeding doses are in proportion to body weight raised to the first power (i.e., equivalence
based on feeding dose/body weight/day). This approach is the one that FDA has traditionally used in extrapolating
results of rodent carcinogen bioassays to man. However, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 5, 1992 (57 FR 24152), EPA, FDA, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission published a draft report proposing
to establish a common default methodology for determining equivalence in carcinogenic unit risks between mammalian
species. If adopted, this unified default approach will be used in those cases where existing agent-specific data
are insufficient to make a case-by-case determination. Based on an analysis of empirical and theoretical aspects
of the cross-species dose-scaling question, the proposed unified default approach assumes that the lifetime cancer
risk from the intake of a carcinogenic substance is equal in different mammalian species when the daily feeding doses
are in proportion to body weight raised to the 3/4 power (i.e., equivalence based on feeding dose/body weight

3/4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this proposed unified default methodology has not been adopted by the three agencies, FDA has used it to calculate
a second estimate of the upper-bound lifetime cancer risk from TCDD exposure if all bleached food-contact paper products
meet the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt for residual levels of TCDD. Using a scaling factor based
on equivalence of pg/kg

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Using this carcinogenic unit risk for TCDD and an upper-bound daily dietary exposure estimate of 0.03 pg TCDD equivalents/kg
body weight/day, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents
would be 9 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the use of bleached food-contact paper products meeting a 2 ppt TCDD specification (Ref. 25).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both of the above upper-bound lifetime risk estimates (3 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 risk as the best estimate of what the upper-bound lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents would be when all bleached
food-contact paper products meet the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt for residual levels of TCDD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of: (1) FDA's 1990 risk assessment which showed an upper-bound lifetime cancer risk of less than 0.04 in
1 million for each year of exposure based on residual levels of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products
manufactured between 1988 and 1990; (2) the significant progress made by the paper industry in reducing residual
TCDD and TCDF in bleached paper products (AFPA has submitted to FDA the results of an industry wide survey conducted
during the first quarter of 1993 showing that U.S. manufacturers have implemented standard operating procedures
that result in bleached food contact paper products that meet the voluntary specification for 2 ppt or less of TCDD);
and (3) FDA's new risk assessment that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from TCDD toxic equivalents
is 3 x 10

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 if all bleached food-contact paper products in fact meet the paper industry's voluntary specification of 2 ppt for
residual levels of TCDD, FDA tentatively concludes that the continued use of bleached paper and paperboard in contact
with food is safe during the time that has been, and will be, needed by FDA to complete its evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA will continue to monitor the paper industry's progress in reducing TCDD and TCDF contamination of bleached food-contact
paper products manufactured in the United States. The agency will also consider monitoring residual levels of TCDD
and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper and paperboard imported into this country as well as in the bleached paper
and paperboard packaging of imported foods. Information currently available to the agency shows that imported bleached
food-contact paper products comprise only 3 percent of such products used in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Data obtained in a recent human epidemiological study involving workers exposed to low levels of TCDD may also provide
an additional approach to assessing the carcinogenic risk to humans (Ref. 26). FDA plans to review these data and determine
if they are suitable for risk assessment purposes. If suitable, the carcinogenic potency for TCDD in humans obtained
using these data would provide an alternative to the current risk assessment approach which requires the extrapolation
from animal data. FDA will also consider any other data that become available while it completes its review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of FDA's monitoring of the residual levels of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products together
with data and comments received in response to this notice will be used by FDA to determine if any regulatory action
is needed to ensure the safe use of such products. If FDA determines that regulatory action is necessary, one possible
course of action would be to amend the food additive regulations to establish a specification for maximum allowable
levels of residual TCDD and TCDF in food-contact paper products in accordance with section 409 of the act. Using this
approach, bleached paper that is intended for use in food-contact articles, and that is expected to contain TCDD and
TCDF that will migrate into food, would be regarded as a food additive as defined in section 201(s) of the act and be subject
to premarket approval under section 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 348). A substance, such as bleached paper, that has not
been shown to cause cancer, but that contains a carcinogenic impurity such as TCDD, is evaluated under the general
safety clause of the statute using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty
that no harm will result from its use (

, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)). The risk assessment procedures could be used by FDA to determine the residual level
of TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper at which there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from
the use of the bleached paper. FDA would institute rulemaking to amend its food additive regulations to authorize
the food-contact use of bleached paper the contain such levels of TCDD and TCDF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second course of action would be for FDA not to proceed with rulemaking and to take action against TCDD and TCDF in food-contact
paper products on a case-by-case basis. To clarify the levels that would be of concern to FDA, the agency could publish
an action level for residual TCDD and TCDF in bleached food-contact paper products. FDA relies on action levels to
provide guidance on the level of added poisonous or deleterious substances that may render food adulterated. The
agency has found action levels to be particularly useful in cases, such as the TCDD and TCDF contamination of bleached
paper products, where the technology and science associated with an issue continue to change. Although the act is
mute on the use of action levels, court decisions on this regulatory approach (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) announces the availability of funds to support community prevention
coalitions to demonstrate and systematically study approaches to prevent and reduce alcohol, tobacco and other
drug abuse and other drug-related problems through the further development of coalitions and partnerships, at the
State, regional, and/or local level. This will involve the expansion of long-range, comprehensive, multi-disciplinary
community-wide substance abuse prevention programming that reflects the next step in furthering CSAP's mission
to support and promote strengthening of comprehensive prevention systems. The Community Prevention Coalitions
Demonstration (CPCD) Grant Program is authorized under Sections 501(d)(5) and 516 of the Public Health Service Act,
as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Noting the development and strengthening of community partnership programs across the country, CSAP will support,
under this announcement, grants to promote the progression of this programmatic concept. The new CPCD grant program
will build on the lessons being learned from CSAP's Community Partnership Demonstration Grant Program and similar
programs in the field, e.g., Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's ``Fighting Back'' grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CSAP model of community-based prevention facilitates the incorporation of substance abuse prevention services
into the general health care system. With health care reform, this approach which emphasizes greater integration
of services, an elimination of duplication, and the need for community self-sufficiency in responding to substance
abuse problems finds particular relevance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conceptual framework of the Community Partnership Program embraces and operationalizes community empowerment,
which is a keystone of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services goals for the Department_empower
communities, emphasize prevention, and value the consumer.

Healthy People 2000: The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention
objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. This program announcement,
``Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grants,'' is in keeping with objectives in the priority areas
of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, and educational and community-based health programs, including objectives
relating to the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-Use of Tobacco: The medical dangers and high risk of addiction associated with firsthand use of tobacco products
have been thoroughly documented. Moreover, data presented in leading medical journals (for example, New England
Journal of Medicine, June 10, 1993) and reported widely in the press, associate environmental exposure to tobacco
smoke (passive smoking) with increased rates of cancer and other pulmonary diseases among people of all ages and with
increased rates of asthma among children. Further, scientific evidence supports the connection between the use
of smokeless tobacco products, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, and cancer of the mouth, jaw and throat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical questions now facing public health experts concern the most effective methods for preventing youth from
using tobacco products and for preventing and/or reducing infants' and children's exposure to smoke in both public
and private environments. A combined approach involving public policy, media awareness, and prevention education
strategies appears to be a promising way to address this serious problem; however, careful development, implementation,
and evaluation of specific tobacco use prevention strategies is required to establish their efficacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSAP recognizes that its target populations are vulnerable to a variety of preventable health and social problems,
including substance abuse. Therefore, CSAP believes that preventative education, policy and media advocacy leading
to environmental and social change concerning use of tobacco products must be a priority for grantees. Further, CSAP
strongly encourages all grantees to provide smoke-free programs and work environments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Description: Based on these early indications of the impact of community-wide coalitions, as well as a national
need to develop promising, innovative approaches to drug abuse prevention, CSAP will consider applications that
provide a strategy for testing the effectiveness of the model described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the long term and difficult nature of establishing community partnerships (Altman, Endres, Linzer, 1991;
Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, 1994; Florin, Mitchell and Stevenson, 1993), and the fact that this is a demonstration
program seeking to understand the potential of partnership programs, successful applicants must be able to document
a fully operational and effective partnership and provide a solid rationale to justify enhancing the nature of its
current partnership efforts, in accord with the provisions of this announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new CPCD Grant Program seeks to demonstrate the potential of: (1) Expanding the scope of existing, well-developed
partnerships programmatically and geographically, and/or (2) developing multiple partnerships into coalitions
in their current area to address other drug-related health and social problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CPCD Program is an important part of CSAP's ongoing, long-term objective to achieve and document measurable reductions
in substance abuse incidence, prevalence, and related consequences such as alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related
health problems, mental disorders and comorbidity, crimes, deaths and injuries among all age and ethnic groups within
a community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds are available to test the effectiveness of extending the original partnership concept through one of two approaches
reflecting the above concepts: (1) Local Prevention Linkages, or (2) State/Regional Coalitions. Applicants must
choose one of these approaches and provide a rationale for their belief that using this approach will significantly
enhance the effectiveness of substance abuse prevention efforts in the area served by the proposed multi-partnership
coalition. Funding will be consistent with the intent of Congress that direct prevention services should be approximately
50 percent of the project budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Model: CSAP is seeking applications that demonstrate the effectiveness of the two partnership/coalition
approaches which are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Community Partnership-Initiated Approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_This approach would expand a local community partnership(s) to form a larger coalition comprised of a minimum of
two partnerships (at least one of which is established and one of which is new) to provide integrated, community-based
prevention services across a larger geographical area. At a minimum, this expansion would require the addition of
at least one new community-based partnership. Thus, a community partnership initiated approach would have at least
two (2) partnerships to establish a CPCD coalition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed projects must include a rationale for the expansion and document strategies that will enhance substance
abuse prevention programming across the expanded area. This rationale should include identifying and justifying
enhancements in the following: (1) Prevention services (such as peer counseling, pre- and post-natal care, cross-cultural
education programs); (2) successful prevention activities and related services (such as youth alternative programs,
parental support and skills development, mentoring and role modeling by intermediaries, violence related activities);
(3) environmental, social policy and media strategies aimed at alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse prevention;
and (4) a plan and design for coordinating and streamlining prevention efforts that can serve to improve service delivery
and promote cost-effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach should demonstrate how to effectively expand and coordinate prevention services across a broader
geographical area that will result in sharing ideas, expanding state-of-the-art practices in diverse disciplines
and fields, and identifying effective substance abuse prevention measures for implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants must keep in mind that all new services must be community-based and developed at the local level, consistent
with program development approaches that have been documented by CSAP. One of the challenges of the demonstration
is to unify a number of disparate, geographically diverse, community-based programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. State-Coordinated Approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_This approach would have the same design and purpose as described for the community initiated approach, except that
the State would be the applicant and would serve as the coordinating body in the formation of the broader coalition.
A State-coordinated approach could serve a particular region within the State or encompass the entire State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the State would bring together at least two (2) existing substance abuse prevention partnerships,
allow for a broad array of prevention activities such as those relating to the ones described above, provide for the
addition of at least one new community-based partnership, and establish the requisite coordinating and streamlining
activities. Thus, a State initiated approach would have no fewer than two (2) existing partnerships and one (1) new
partnership in the CPCD coalition. Several States have already made progress in developing regional and State-wide
networks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CSAP substance abuse partnership/coalition model may serve in bridging a variety of broad-based prevention
efforts, including violence and crime reduction, adolescent pregnancy, the spread of sexually transmitted disease,
including HIV/AIDS, and school dropout prevention. It allows existing community-based partnerships and programs
that currently address substance abuse to demonstrate the effectiveness of expanding their base and their efforts
to address related health, social and safety issues through further interaction and linkages with other local coalitions
and partnerships. This type of expansion can have a positive impact on preventing substance abuse through new or stronger
prevention service systems both within the community itself and among affiliated communities. For example, and
to the extent appropriate, partnership substance abuse prevention strategies and services may include the following
areas of concern:

This program encourages that approximately 50 percent of Federal funds be used for the provision of prevention services
and approximately 15&hyph;25 percent for evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the CPCD Program provides the opportunity for community resources such as local coalitions, partnerships,
service providers, and programs to formally collaborate, applicants are required to include a description of agreements,
commitments and processes to be used in developing and implementing the proposed project. (This documentation must
be provided in Appendix 4 of the application entitled, ``Letters of Commitment from Collaborating Organizations/Agencies/Individuals.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing partnerships are expected to have conducted needs assessments and are to use their needs assessment to:
determine gaps in prevention services; identify any inefficiencies in the delivery of these services; and to begin
work towards changing formerly established priorities to meet current needs. All new services proposed must be supported
by the needs assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed projects submitted under this announcement must present a five (5) year comprehensive substance abuse
prevention plan to demonstrate and study the development, implementation, and effectiveness of their design. The
applicant's initial plan should include a discussion of all preliminary goals, objectives, and activities. These
may be refined as appropriate, as the program evolves and progresses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation must be an essential part of the plan for assessing the impact of the changes and services on the substance
abuse-related problems in the community. Details are provided in the section on Evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligibility: Applications may be submitted by public agencies, such as State, local and tribal governments, or local
private (non-profit) organizations/agencies (i.e., existing partnerships, universities). In all cases, the
applicant must be designated to act on behalf of the larger evolving coalition of multiple partnerships proposed
in the CPCD grant application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Grant Program is intended to build on the work of already
existing prevention partnerships, by expanding both the base and the service capabilities of these partnerships
into broader-based coalitions, this announcement requires that applicants be part of established community partnerships.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant organization must be a member of the coalition (to be developed) and be supported by its (the proposed
coalition) membership in receiving an award under this program activity. This agreement must be documented through
a letter of support from each member of the proposed coalition. (These letters must be provided in Appendix 4 of the
application entitled ``Letters of Commitment from Collaborating Organizations/Agencies/Individuals.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSAP strongly encourages applications from tribal governments, Native American/Alaskan Native partnerships
or Indian Nations. Such applicants must already be existing partnerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previous or current CSAP Community Partnership Demonstration Program grantees are eligible to apply for a new grant
under this announcement. Currently funded CSAP Community Partnership grantees must demonstrate their ability
to fulfill the requirements of their current grant in addition to taking on the expanded tasks and responsibilities
of the Community Prevention Coalitions Demonstration Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSAP Community Partnership grantees will not be permitted to use Community Partnership project staff for full-time

Evaluation Plan: This CPCD Program requires more rigor in the conceptualization, design and implementation of projects
and in their evaluation than the previous Community Partnership Program. The goal is to achieve and document measurable
reductions in alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse incidence, prevalence, and related consequences such as alcohol
and other drug related health problems, violence, deaths, and injuries among all age and ethnic groups within a community
or regional area. Applications submitted under this announcement must present a multi-year comprehensive substance
abuse prevention plan for systems change at the community or geographic area level through the design and implementation
of one of the two approaches discussed in the Program Model section of this announcement. The application must contain
an evaluation plan which will enable the grantee to assess the effect of the prevention program on a variety of indicators,
as described in the remainder of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate goal of this program is to demonstrate significant reductions in substance abuse. The broad outcomes
expected include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A measurable and sustained reduction in initiation of alcohol, tobacco and other drug use among children and adolescents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A reduction in alcohol, tobacco and other drug related deaths and injuries especially among children, adolescents
and young adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A decline in the prevalence of health problems related to and exacerbated by alcohol, tobacco and other drug use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A reduction in on the job problems and injuries related to substance abuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A reduction in substance abuse related crime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSAP will support only applicant projects that have a well developed and comprehensive evaluation plan. The evaluation
plan must be conceptually and procedurally integrated with the overall project, and must have both an outcome evaluation
component and a process evaluation component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the purpose for this program is to reduce the incidence and prevalence of substance abuse and related health
and safety problems in the targeted area, instruments should be used which will provide periodic measures of these
indicators. In addition to measures of incidence and prevalence related to substance abuse and related health and
safety problems, grantees will be required to collect data on the seven (7) items listed in the Community Wide Indicators
of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse included in the Application Kit. Applicants must specify the means to be used to collect
these data. Grantees will be required to collect baseline data, yearly progress report data, and end of project data,
and may be required to collect follow-up data on all indices. Grantees will be required to submit all reports and results
in both hard copy and in electronic media formats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation plan must present a sound methodology for the collection, storage, analysis, and interpretation
of data. The evaluation plan must utilize psychometrically sound measures and instruments for data collection.
Applicants must describe the selection of instruments to be used and must provide information about their normative
properties, including the appropriateness of their use for the culture(s) under study. The presented evaluation
methods, measures and instruments must be sensitive and relevant to the target groups of the community with respect
to age and gender distribution, reading level, and culture. The evaluation plan must also present a time-line for
carrying out all evaluation procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation plan must be designed and carried out by a professional who is highly experienced in comparative evaluation
methodology, independent of the project, and able to work closely with the grantee.

Fifteen to 25 percent of the funds available are to be used for the evaluation component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outcome Evaluation: Outcome evaluation assesses whether the project was effective in achieving its goals, objectives
and activities. For the purposes of this grant program, the outcome evaluation must provide periodic measures on
the community or geographic area in the following broad categorical areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Substance abuse prevalence, incidence, frequency and amount; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Substance abuse-related health, safety and risk indicators (e.g., HIV/AIDS, crime, violence, unemployment,
etc). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outcome evaluation design should employ a time series design, which allows for comparisons within and between
communities or geographic areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outcome Evaluation Questions: At a minimum, applicants should include the following questions in the outcome evaluation
component: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable reductions in use/abuse of identified
substances, and/or health and safety problems of the target groups in the community or geographic area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable increases in knowledge and anti-substance
abuse attitudes by residents of the community or geographic area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable increases in the target group(s)'
ability to resist substance abuse and related risky behaviors? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable decreases in the target group's
school absences or truancy rates in the community or geographic area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a perceived increase in safety and a measurable
decrease in drug dealing in the community or geographic area neighborhoods? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in measurable decreases in the rate of domestic
violence in the community or geographic area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a measurable reduction in the number of violent
crimes associated with substance abuse in the community or geographic area? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a measurable reduction in the number of substance
abuse related emergency room admissions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Does the presence of the Coalition and prevention program result in a measurable reduction in the number of substance
abuse related vehicle crashes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Does the presence of the Coalition result in measurable increases in environmental/social change policies
(i.e., number of ordinances introduced/enacted/repealed; limited alcohol and tobacco advertising, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grantees will be required to collect uniform baseline and yearly data on some indicators using standardized instruments.
Data collection and analysis, aggregation to group, and procedures for transmitting the results to CSAP will be provided
at the first grantee meeting following award. OMB approval will be obtained for use of the instruments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Process Evaluation: Process evaluation is both a quantitative and qualitative description of a project. It documents
the evolution of the project from inception through implementation and completion. The process evaluation documents
what was actually done, what was learned, what barriers inhibited implementation, how such barriers were resolved,
and what should be done differently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future projects. In short, process evaluation allows for successful projects to be replicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this grant, program process evaluation should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Document and describe the processes by which the coalition is expanded, refocused, implemented and operated;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Identify factors associated with effective planning and implementation of the prevention strategies for the
community or geographic area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comparison Community or Area: Use of comparison communities or geographic areas which closely resemble the community
or area served by the coalition is an excellent way to provide a rigorous test of the effectiveness of the interventions
to be implemented under this announcement. CSAP realizes that finding suitable comparison communities may be difficult
because of the increasing popularity of the partnership movement, and considerable effort may be needed to identify
a similar community willing to participate in the full evaluation process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comparison and target communities/areas should be as similar as possible at baseline, because the greater the similarity
between the target and comparison communities/areas, the greater the likelihood of detecting and explaining effects
of the coalition prevention program on the target community/area. The comparison communities/areas should not
have a prevention program similar to the one intended for the target community/area. The target and comparison communities/areas
should be geographically distant enough to prevent the transmission of program activities from the target to the
comparison communities/areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSAP realizes the difficulties applicants may have in identifying comparison communities or areas. CSAP is also
aware of the limitations of this approach given the variation and potential for contamination of prevention programs
across communities, regions or States. Despite these limitations, applicants are encouraged to use this approach.
However, applicants will not be adversely affected by using a different evaluation approach that will yield scientifically
credible data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation in National Cross-Site Evaluation: A National cross-site evaluation project will be conducted with
the goals of identifying: (1) Successful and innovative community-based Coalition models; (2) effective strategies
for the prevention of substance abuse, related health and safety problems and risk factors; (3) common inhibitors
to forming effective Coalitions: (4) common inhibitors to design and implementation of effective prevention strategies;
(5) Coalition models that effectively prepare the service infrastructure of communities for the eventual implementation
of Health Care Reform; and (6) Coalition models and prevention strategies that produce the most benefits for the lowest
monetary costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects funded under this announcement will be required to participate in the National cross-site evaluation,
by contributing data that are comparable across projects. A detailed description of the National Cross-site Evaluation
Plan will be communicated to the funded projects at the beginning of the grant program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although participation in the National Evaluation project is mandatory, grantees will not have to expend grant funds
for activities that are not already within the local-level evaluation plans. Selected grantees will be technically
and financially supported by the National Cross-site Evaluation project for activities that are not within the purview
of their local-level projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coordination with Other Federal/Non-Federal Programs: Applicants seeking support under this announcement are
encouraged to coordinate with other Federal, State, and local public and private programs serving their target population.
Program coordination helps to better serve the multiple needs of the client population, to maximize the impact of
available resources, and to prevent duplication of services. Funding priority will be given to applicants who demonstrate
a coordinated approach to providing comprehensive substance abuse prevention services (see Award Criteria). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Single State Agency Coordination: Coordination and collaboration with the Single State Agency (SSA) for alcohol
and other drug abuse is encouraged to ensure communication, reduce duplication, and facilitate continuity. The
application must include a copy of a letter sent to the SSA that briefly describes the proposed project. A copy of this
letter should be included in Appendix B to the application entitled ``Letters to/from SSAs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of SSAs can be found in the grant application kit. If the target population falls within the jurisdiction of more
than one State, all representative SSAs should be involved. Evidence of support for the proposed project from the
SSA and from the State Public Health Agency will be considered in making funding decisions (See ``Award Decision Criteria''
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intergovernmental Review (E.O. 12372): Applications submitted in response to this announcement are subject to
the intergovernmental review requirements of Executive Order 12372, as implemented through DHHS regulations at
45 CFR Part 100. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of applications for Federal financial
assistance. Applicants (other than Federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact the State's
Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective application and to receive any
necessary instructions on the State's review process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant
is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. A current listing of SPOCs is included in the application kit.
The SPOC should send any State process recommendations to the following address at CSAP (

Review Process: Applications accepted for review will be assigned, at the central receipt point (Division of Research
Grants, NIH), to an Initial Review Group (IRG) composed primarily of non-Federal experts. Applications will be reviewed
by the IRG for technical merit in accordance with established PHS/SAMHSA peer review procedures for grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notification of the IRG's recommendation will be sent to the applicant upon completion of the initial review. In addition
to the IRG's recommendations on technical merit, applications will undergo a second level of review by the appropriate
advisory council, whose review may be based on policy considerations as well as technical merit. Applications may
be considered for funding only if the advisory council concurs with the IRG's recommendation for approval.

The exchange is being proposed by Olympic Land Corporation. The purpose of the exchange is to acquire non-federal
lands located along the Virgin River, within the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area and within the Toiyabe
and Inyo National Forests. The exchange is consistent with the Bureau's planning for the lands involved and has been
discussed with local governmental officials. The public interest will be served by making the exchange. The value
of the lands will be determined by an appraisal. If the exchange values are not equal, the transaction will be phased
or the acreage adjusted or money will be used to equalize the values upon approval of the final appraisal of both the
offered and selected lands. The selected lands were identified in a Notice of Realty Action published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the National Park Service (NPS) announces
the availability of a supplement to the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) for the Gary Marina. The city
of Gary proposes to construct a marina on Lake Michigan adjacent to the west boundary of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
The proposed marina would require an access road through Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. The supplement to the
DEIS was prepared by the city of Gary and the NPS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The city of Gary and the NPS's preferred alternative for marina access is identified in the supplement to the DEIS as
the ``proposed'' access alternative; construction of an access road on the abandoned Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad
bed, within the west end of Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and on U.S. Steel Corporation property, adjacent to,
but outside, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. This is a new alternative that was not previously described in the
DEIS of April 1989. The new alternative was developed in response to public and agency comment on the DEIS. Many comments
called for the development of an access alternative with less impact to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore than those
presented in the DEIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The city of Gary and the NPS's preferred alternative for the marina location is identified in the DEIS as Site 1, which
is behind an existing breakwater on land currently owned by U.S. Steel Corporation. All other marina site alternatives
described in the DEIS have been eliminated from further consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the Supplement to the DEIS should be received no later than June 7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the supplement to the DEIS should be submitted to: Mr. Dale Engquist, Superintendent, Indiana Dunes National
Lakeshore, 1100 N. Mineral Springs Road, Porter, Indiana 46304, (219) 926&hyph;7561 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Commission hereby gives notice of the institution of preliminary antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;696&hyph;698
(Preliminary) under section 733(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1673b(a)) to determine whether there is a reasonable
indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or
the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from the People's
Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine of unwrought magnesium (primary magnesium), provided for
in subheadings 8104.11.00 and 8104.19.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, that are alleged
to be sold in the United States at less than fair value. The Commission must complete preliminary antidumping investigations
in 45 days, or in this case by May 16, 1994.

 The Copyright Royalty Tribunal Reform Act of 1993 abolished the Royalty Tribunal as an independent agency and transferred
its responsibilities and duties to ad hoc Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels (CARPs) to be administered by the
Library of Congress and the Copyright Office. To assure that time sensitive mail relating to CARP business is not delayed
in the general incoming mail the Office receives, the Office has established a separate post office box that is to be
used only for CARP claims, filings, and general correspondence. Such mail should be addressed to: Copyright Arbitration
Royalty Panel (CARP), P.O. Box 70977, Southwest Station, Washington, DC 20024.

The proposed meeting is for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applicants. Because the proposed meeting will
consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that this meeting
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company, et. al., (the
licensee), for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS) Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Wintersburg, Arizona.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 26, 1993, the licensee proposed to change technical specifications (TS) to allow an increase
in fuel enrichment (Uranium 235) to a maximum of 4.30 weight percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to the TS are required in order to provide the licensee with operational flexibility to use fuel
enriched with U&hyph;235 up to 4.30 weight percent at PVNGS, Units 1, 2, and 3. The present TS permit a maximum of 4.05
weight percent U&hyph;235. Thus the change to the TS was requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and concludes that storage and use of
fuel enriched with U&hyph;235 up to 4.30 weight percent at PVNGS, Units 1, 2, and 3 is acceptable. The safety considerations
associated with higher enrichments have been evaluated by the NRC staff and the staff has concluded that such changes
would not adversely affect plant safety. The proposed changes have no adverse effect on the probability of any accident.
There will be no change to authorized power level. There was no change requested to current 52,000 MWD/MTU burnup.
The change in fuel enrichment is bounded by NRC staff generic review (discussed below). As a result, there is no significant
increase in individual or cumulative radiation exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental impacts of transportation resulting from the use of higher enrichment and extended irradiation
are discussed in the staff assessment entitled ``NRC Assessment of the Environmental Effects of Transportation
Resulting from Extended Fuel Enrichment and Irradiation.'' This assessment was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on August 11, 1988 (53 FR 30355) as corrected on August 24, 1988 (53 FR 32322) in connection with the Shearon Harris Nuclear
Power Plant, Unit 1: Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact. As indicated therein, the environmental
cost contribution of an increase in fuel enrichment of up to 5 weight percent U&hyph;235 and irradiation limits of
up to 60,000 MWD/MTU are either unchanged, or may in fact be reduced from those summarized in Table S&hyph;4 as set forth
in 10 CFR 51.52(c). These findings are applicable to the proposed amendments for PVNGS, Units 1, 2, and 3. Accordingly,
the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes involve systems located within the restricted
area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental
impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination,
and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 2860). No request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. The staff considered denial of the proposed
action. This would not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;41, NPF&hyph;51, and NPF&hyph;74 issued to Arizona Public Service Company, (the licensee),
for operation of Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3 located in Wintersburg, Arizona.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would revise the provisions in the Technical Specifications (TS) related to increasing the pressurizer
safety valve (PSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +3 percent and ^1 percent, increasing the main steam safety
valve (MSSV) setpoint tolerance from +/^1 percent to +/^3 percent, reducing the high pressurizer pressure trip setpoint
(HPPT) response time from 1.15 seconds to 0.5 second, and reducing the Technical Specifications minimum auxiliary
feedwater (AFW) pump flow requirement from 750 gallons per minute (GPM) to 650 GPM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application for amendment dated November 13, 1990, as supplemented
by letters of additional information dated May 27, 1992, May 13, 1993, and November 12, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to the TS are required in order to provide the licensee with operational flexibility in meeting
surveillance requirements for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) flow, and pressurizer safety valve (PSV) and main steam
safety valve (MSSV) lift setpoint tolerances. The proposed change to the TS also involves a reduction of the high pressurizer
pressure trip (HPPT) response time. This reduction is necessary to ensure that the peak pressures during postulated
accident scenarios for the other changes (AWF, PSV, and MSSV) do not violate safety limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision to the TS and the licensee's assessment of increased
radiological release as a result of the safety valve setpoint tolerance change and the proposed reduction in auxiliary
feedwater flow. For the most limiting SGTR scenario, this results in an increase in the 2-hour thyroid dose from 200
rem to less than 248 rem. Adding the increased dose due to the expanded PSV and MSSV setpoint tolerances (which the licensee
calculated as a 5-percent dose increase), results in a 2-hour dose of 260 rem. This value provides adequate margin
to the 10 CFR part 100 guideline of 300 rem. The licensee also evaluated radiological release for the reactor coolant
pump (RCP) shaft seizure event, and determined that the calculated 0.5 rem increase was insignificant compared to
the 246 rem dose reported in Supplement 2 to the staff's Safety Evaluation Report related to the Combustion Engineering
Standard Safety Analyses Report (CESSAR) for System 80, and the 300 rem SRP acceptance criteria. The staff finds the
analysis results, utilizing proper conservatisms, to be within 10 CFR guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no
changes are being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase
in the allowable individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes
that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological plant effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on December 27, 1990 (55 FR 53220). Two petitions for leave to intervene and request for hearing were filed following
this Notice. One request was denied and the other granted. However, the party that was granted the hearing later voluntarily
withdrew their contention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental effects that would result from the proposed
action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. This would not reduce environmental impacts
of plant operation and would result in reduced operational flexibility.

Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
related to operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station Units 1, 2, and 3, dated February 1982 (NUREG 0841).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. NPF&hyph;29, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the Grand Gulf Nuclear
Station, Unit 1, located in Claiborne County, Louisiana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment, requested by the licensee by letter of October 15, 1993, would represent a full conversion
from the current Technical Specifications (TS) to a set of TS based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR/6 Technical
Specifications,'' Revision O, September 1992. NUREG&hyph;1434 has been developed through working groups composed
of both NRC staff members and the BWR/6 owners and has been endorsed by the staff as part of an industry-wide initiative
to standardize and improve TS. As part of this submittal, the licensee has applied the criteria contained in the Final
NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements to the current Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, Unit 1 Technical
Specifications utilizing BWR Owners' Group (BWROG) report NEDO&hyph;31466, ``Technical Specification Screening
Criteria Application and Risk Assessment,'' (and Supplement 1) as incorporated in NUREG&hyph;1434. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has categorized the proposed changes into four general groupings. These groupings are characterized
as administrative changes, relocated changes, more restrictive changes, and less restrictive changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative changes are those that involve reformatting, renumbering and rewording of the existing TS. The reformatting,
renumbering and rewording process reflects the attributes of NUREG&hyph;1434 and do not involve technical changes
to the existing TS. Such changes are administrative in nature and do not impact initiators of analyzed events or assumed
mitigation of accident or transient events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relocated changes are those involving relocation of requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components
or variables that do not meet the criteria of inclusion in TS as identified in the Application of Selection Criteria
to the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station TS. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to
be initiators of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and
surveillances for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the TS to administratively
controlled documents. Changes to these documents will be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected
structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are subject
to 10 CFR 50.59 and subject to the change control provision in the Administrative Controls Section of the TS. These
proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More restrictive changes are those involving more stringent requirements for operation of the facility. These more
stringent requirements do not result in operation that will alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident
or transient event. The more restrictive requirements continue to ensure process variables, structures, systems
and components are maintained consistent with the safety analyses and licensing basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes characterized as less restrictive have been subdivided into four additional subcategories. They include:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relocating details to TS Bases, the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR), or procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements to be transposed from the TS to the Bases, USAR or procedures are the same as those currently included
in the existing TS. The TS Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information are subject to 10 CFR 50.59
and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Extension of instrumentation surveillance test intervals (STIs) and allowed outage times (AOTs). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes affect only the STIs and AOTs and will not impact the function of monitoring system variables
over the anticipated ranges for normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences, or accident conditions.
However, the changes are expected to reduce the test related plant scrams and test induced wear on the equipment. General
Electric Topical Reports GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;1 and GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;2 showed that the effects
of these extensions of STIs and AOTs, which produced negligible impact, are bounded by previous analyses. Further,
the NRC has reviewed these reports and approved the conclusions on a generic basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relocation of instrumentation only requirements (which provide no post-accident function). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These requirements are part of the routine operational monitoring and are not considered in the safety analysis.
Changes made to the Bases, USAR, and procedures containing the relocated information will be made in accordance with
10 CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. These
proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other less restrictive changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional changes that result in less restrictions in the TS are discussed individually in the licensee's submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By May 12, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714,
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Judge George W. Armstrong Library, Post Office Box 1406,
S. Commerce at Washington, Natchez, Mississippi 39120. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene
is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or
by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary
or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but
such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner
shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to
be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised
or controverted. In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and
a concise statement of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner
intends to rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific
sources and documents of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those
facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with
the applicant on material issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendments
under consideration. The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner
who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will
not be permitted to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to William D. Beckner, Director, Project Directorate IV&hyph;1: petitioner's
name and telephone number, date petition was mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Winston &amp; Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., 12th Floor, Washington,
DC 20005&hyph;3502, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests

On March 22, 1988, and March 28, 1989, the Commission issued Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;76 and NPF&hyph;80
to Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company, et al. (the licensee) for South Texas Project, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively.
The license provided, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the
Commission.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1), ``each licensee shall successfully complete a requalification program developed
by the facility licensee that has been approved by the Commission. The program shall be conducted for a continuous
period not to exceed 24 months in duration.'' Also, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.59(c)(1), ``The requalification program
must be conducted for a continuous period not to exceed two years, and upon conclusion must be promptly followed, pursuant
to a continuous schedule, by successive requalification programs.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated December 17, 1993, as supplemented by letter dated January 14, 1994, the licensee requested a one-time
exemption from 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) and (c)(1) which would extend the current requalification cycle to April 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, ``The Commission may, upon application by an interested person, or upon its own initiative,
grant such exemptions from the requirements of the regulations in this part as it determines are authorized by law
and will not endanger life or property and are otherwise in the public interest.''

HL&amp;P increased the operating staff from five to six crews to reduce the burden placed on the operating staff. The
increase to six crews is in the public interest in that it will allow sufficient numbers of operating personnel to maintain
individual workloads at a reasonable level while on shift without the need for routine overtime and still allow for
continued uninterrupted training. The licensee began its six-operating crew, six-week requalification training
plan in January 1994. Because of the additional crew, the current requalification cycle, which began on April 13,
1992, will continue until April 22, 1994. The extension of the training cycle is unavoidable in order to enhance the
operations staff while maintaining adequate staffing levels. The exemption will allow the licensee to exceed the
24-month limit stated in 10 CFR 55.59 by ten days.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 55.11, this exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property, and is otherwise in the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby grants Houston Lighting &amp; Power Company an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 55.59(a)(1) and (c)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of the Exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 11330).

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating
to Foreign Listing Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
April 5, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on February 23, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange is proposing to amend Section 110 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Company Guide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to allow non-U.S. issuers to provide their U.S. shareholders with summary annual reports under certain circumstances.
The following is the text of the proposed rule change, with italics representing the language to be added:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110. Securities of Foreign Companies *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Disclosure_The Exchange will require the company to: (i) furnish to American shareholders an English language
version of its annual financial statements and all other materials regularly provided to other shareholders, and
(ii) publish, at least semi-annually, an English language version of its interim financial statements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
In addition, the Exchange will permit non-U.S. issuers to follow home country practices regarding the distribution
of annual reports to shareholders, if, at a minimum, shareholders (i) are provided at least summary annual reports
and (ii) have the ability, upon request, to receive a complete annual report, and the financial information contained
in the summary annual report is reconciled to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to the extent that such
reconciliation would be required in the full annual report.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the propose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In 1990 the U.K. Companies Act was amended to permit issuers listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide holders
of their ordinary shares with an option to receive either a full annual report or a summary annual report. The U.K. Companies
Act sets forth the specific financial and management information that must be contained in the summary reports, and
requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity, at any time, to obtain the
full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually of this right and how the
report might be obtained. When the amendments first became effective, shareholders received both reports and notice
of the available option with respect to future reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the amendments was to provide: (1) Potential cost savings to issuers, and (2) a more easily read document
to retail holders. A majority of U.K. shareholders now receive the summary reports, and the amendments are viewed
as successful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain U.K. issuers would now like to provide U.S. holders of listed ADRs with summary reports in place of full annual
reports if the holders do not object. The Commission recently approved a New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') rule change
which allows non-U.S. issuers which are NYSE-listed to mail summary annual reports to U.S. share/ADR holders in lieu
of the full annual report, if permitted by home country practice.

 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33661, International Series Release No. 637 (February 23, 1994), 59 FR 10028
(March 2, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange is proposing to similarly amend Section 110 of the Exchange's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Company Guide,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is comparable to the NYSE provision described above. Section 110 currently allows the Exchange to consider
the laws, customs and practices of the country where a non-U.S. issuer is domiciled in evaluating the listing eligibility
of a company whose corporate structure or practices are inconsistent with specified rules which apply to domestic
companies, but requires that a full annual report be provided to all U.S. share/ADR holders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed amendment, a U.S. holder would initially receive both reports and then be provided with an ongoing
option to receive either report.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The summary report would set forth such financial and other information as is required by home country law and would
be required to include a U.S. GAAP reconciliation to the same extent as would be required in the full annual report.
The change would have no impact on the issuer's existing annual and semi-annual SEC reporting obligations.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that, although the U.K. Companies Act requires that shareholders initially receive both reports,
the language of the proposed Amex rule permits non-U.S. issuers to follow home country practices, which may not contain
this requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment is consistent with the Exchange's existing policies with respect to non-U.S. companies,
which permits such companies to follow home country practice in such areas as interim reporting and corporate governance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating
transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.

I. Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would establish, on a permanent basis, PTC's authority to offer participants the opportunity to receive,
on an intraday basis, payment of principal and interest PTC has received on their behalf. PTC first offered this service
on a pilot basis in November 1993.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In addition to making this service permanent, the proposal would codify the requirement that intraday distribution
of P&amp;I shall be made only from P&amp;I payments collected and in immediately available funds at such time, without
recourse to borrowed funds or to alternate sources of funds.

Under this service, participants are able to receive 50% of the P&amp;I payments made with respect to GNMA I securities
by means of an intraday Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds at approximately 12 noon on the distribution
date, with the balance distributed by means of a credit to such participants at end-of-day.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Before November 1993, PTC's rules and procedures provided that PTC disburse P&amp;I on securities deposited at PTC
by means of a credit to a participant's applicable account cash balance. As a result, a participant would receive available
funds in the amount of the P&amp;I, net of any account debits and/or credits, at the end of the day as part of the settlement
payment process.

 These percentages, and the ability of participants to select the method of payment, may change upon future Commission
approval, taking into account P&amp;I collection and disbursement experience, the impact on PTC's settlement cycle
of intraday disbursement of P&amp;I by Fedwire transfer, and participant response to the pilot program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 16, 1993, PTC implemented its early P&amp;I pilot program. A total of 44 participants chose to receive
the early cash disbursement of 50% of their P&amp;I allotment, while 10 chose to receive their total allotment at net
settlement. Letter from John J. Sceppa, President and Chief Executive Officer, PTC, to Judith Poppalardo, Assistant
Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 23, 1993). Each month since then, PTC has affected
a successful intraday distributions of P&amp;I. Letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, Vice President, General Counsel
and Secretary, PTC, to Francois Mazur, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (March 17, 1994).

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act and, specifically,
with sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F).
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Those sections require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance
and settlement of securities transactions and to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that PTC's proposal will allow participants to get P&amp;I funds faster consistent with
systemic concerns. Limiting intra-day payments to immediately available funds held by PTC will ensure that PTC's
other funds are available if required to achieve end-of-day settlement.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Such funds include, but are not limited to, PTC's own funds, funds obtained from PTC's uncommitted P&amp;I line of
credit, as well as other borrowings which may be used to fund P&amp;I distribution when affected as part of the end-of-day
settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants are limited to receiving up to 50% of their P&amp;I allotment disbursement early. Any increase in percentage
would require that PTC file a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes good cause exists for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Amendment No. 1
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 requires that the Commission grant PTC permanent approval of its pilot program for intraday P&amp;I payments.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Because PTC's proposal incorporates into its rules the requirement that intraday disbursement of P&amp;I be limited
to the amount of P&amp;I collected and available, PTC has fulfilled the Commission's requirement for permanent approval
of the pilot program. In addition, the staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors'')
has stated that it believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the safeguarding of securities and funds
in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible, and therefore agrees with the accelerated
approval.

IV. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, the Commission finds that PTC's proposal is consistent with section 17A of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 that PTC's proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;05), as amended, be, and hereby is, approved.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On April
8, 1986, applicant (then known as ValueGuard Stock Fund, Inc.) filed a notification of registration pursuant to section
8(a) of the Act and a registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became
effective on August 6, 1986, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that same date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On June 25, 1992, shareholders of the Timed Equity Asset Management Fund series (``TEAM Fund'') of applicant redeemed
all their TEAM Fund shares at the net asset value per share determined on that date, in exchange for which TEAM Fund distributed
all of its assets totalling $409.86.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On June 18, 1992, and again on October 26, 1992, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization
whereby applicant agreed to transfer all of the assets of its Ray Equity/Income Trust series (``Ray Fund'') to the
Capstone Fund of the Southwest series (the ``Acquiring Fund'') of Capstone Series, Inc., in exchange for shares of
the Acquiring Fund and the assumption by the Acquiring Fund of all identified liabilities of Ray Fund. In accordance
with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring
Fund was in the best interests of applicant's shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would
not be diluted as a result.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other because certain of applicant's
directors and officers also serve as directors and/or officers of the Acquiring Fund. Although purchases and sales
between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption
for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated persons of each other solely by reason
of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the low asset size
and consequent high expense ratios of Ray Fund (b) limited investment flexibility due to Ray Fund's small asset size,
(c) the compatibility of applicant's investment objectives and practices with those of the Acquiring Fund, (d) the
potential of enhanced investment performance, greater flexibility, and increased stability due to larger asset
size, and (e) economies of scale to be realized primarily with respect to fixed expenses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders
on or about September 24, 1992. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the SEC. Applicant's
shareholders approved the reorganization, in accordance with Maryland law, at a special meeting held on October
30, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As of November 2, 1992 (the ``Closing Date'') applicant had 310,577 shares of common stock outstanding with an aggregate
net asset value of $2,047,664, and a per share net asset value of $6.59. On the Closing Date, applicant transferred
all of the assets of the Ray Fund to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for shares of the Acquiring Fund having a net asset
value equal to the value of the assets of the Ray Fund, less any liabilities transferred. The shares received in exchange
for applicant's assets were distributed to applicant's shareholders on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative
expenses totalling approximately $23,000. These expenses were borne by applicant, CAMCO, and the Acquiring Fund,
with applicant's share of the expenses totalling approximately $6,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On August
22, 1985, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Act and a registration statement
pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on March 27, 1986, and applicant
commenced its initial public offering on that same date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On July 16, 1993, applicant's board of directors approved a plan of reorganization whereby applicant agreed to
transfer all of its assets and liabilities to the Value Equity Fund portfolio of Core Funds, Inc. (the ``Acquiring
Fund''), in exchange for Series B shares of the Acquiring Fund. In accordance with rule 17a&hyph;8 of the Act, applicant's
directors determined that the sale of applicant's assets to the Acquiring Fund was in the best interest of applicant's
shareholders, and that the interests of the existing shareholders would not be diluted as a result.

<FOOTNAME>

1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant and the Acquiring Fund may be deemed to be affiliated persons of each other by reason of having a common investment
adviser. Although purchases and sales between affiliated persons generally are prohibited by section 17(a) of the
Act, rule 17a&hyph;8 provides an exemption for certain purchases and sales among investment companies that are affiliated
persons of each other solely by reason of having a common investment adviser, common directors, and/or common officers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In approving the reorganization, the directors considered various factors, including, (a) the low asset size
and consequent high expense ratios of applicant, (b) limited investment flexibility due to applicant's small asset
size, (c) the compatibility of applicant's investment objectives and practices with those of the Acquiring Fund,
(d) the potential of enhanced investment performance, greater flexibility, and increased stability due to larger
asset size, and (e) economies of scale to be realized primarily with respect to fixed expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Proxy materials soliciting shareholder approval of the reorganization were distributed to applicant's shareholders
on or about October 4, 1993. Preliminary and definitive copies of the proxy materials were filed with the SEC. Applicant's
shareholders approved the reorganization, in accordance with Maryland law, at a special meeting held on November
2, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As of November 26, 1993 (the ``Closing Date''), applicant had 330,695 shares of common stock outstanding with an
aggregate net asset value of $3,977,614, and a per share net asset value of $12.03. On the Closing Date, applicant transferred
all of its assets to the Acquiring Fund in exchange for Series B shares of the Acquiring Fund having a net asset value
equal to the value of the assets of applicant, subject to its liabilities. The shares received in exchange for applicant's
assets were distributed to applicant's shareholders on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The expenses in connection with the reorganization consisted of legal, accounting, printing, and administrative
expenses totalling approximately $55,500. These expenses were borne by applicant and the Acquiring Fund, with applicant's
share of the expenses totalling approximately $24,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. As of the date of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party
to any litigation or administrative proceedings. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor does it propose to engage
in, any business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Transportation, by Order 94&hyph;4&hyph;8 in Docket 48780, has rejected the application of ATX,
Inc. to operate as an air carrier, citing the strong influence that Frank Lorenzo, the former chairman of the Texas
Air Corp., would have on the company. In the final decision, the Department found that the record fails to demonstrate
that Lorenzo has a sufficient commitment to safety or to comply with legal requirements. Both Eastern Air Lines and
Continental Airlines, while they were owned by Texas Air Corp. and controlled by Lorenzo, experienced operational,
maintenance, and labor-related problems that were among the most serious in the history of U.S. aviation. These problems
threatened safety to the point that the Federal government had to intervene to ensure the public's protection. While
ATX has adequate financing and meets the citizenship requirements, managerial competence and compliance disposition
are lacking and thus ATX fails to meet the department's airline fitness standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. App. &sect;10(a)(2), that a meeting will be held at the U.S. Treasury Department,
15th and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, on May 3 and 4, 1994, of the following debt management advisory
committee:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agenda for the meeting provides for a technical background briefing by Treasury staff on May 3, followed by a charge
by the Secretary of the Treasury or his designate that the committee discuss particular issues, and a working session.
On May 4, the committee will present a written report of its recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The background briefing by Treasury staff will be held at 11:30 a.m. Eastern time on May 3 and will be open to the public.
The remaining sessions on May 3 and the committee's reporting session on May 4 will be closed to the public, pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. App. &sect;10(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice shall constitute my determination, pursuant to the authority placed in heads of departments by 5 U.S.C.
App. &sect;10(d) and vested in me by Treasury Department Order No. 101&hyph;05, that the closed portions of the meeting
are concerned with information that is exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &sect;552b(c)(9)(A). The public interest
requires that such meetings be closed to the public because the Treasury Department requires frank and full advice
from representatives of the financial community prior to making its final decision on major financing operations.
Historically, this advice has been offered by debt management advisory committees established by the several major
segments of the financial community. When so utilized, such a committee is recognized to be an advisory committee
under 5 U.S.C. App. &sect;3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Treasury's final announcement of financing plans may not reflect the recommendations provided in reports
of the advisory committee, premature disclosure of the committee's deliberations and reports would be likely to
lead to significant financial speculation in the securities market. Thus, these meetings fall within the exemption
covered by 5 U.S.C. &sect;552b(c)(9)(A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance is responsible for maintaining records of debt management
advisory committee meetings and for providing annual reports setting forth a summary of committee activities and
such other matters as may be informative to the public consistent with the policy of 5 U.S.C. &sect;552b.

The members of the Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) will meet in open session from 10:00 A.M. to 11:00 A.M.
to discuss the following matters: (1) approval of the minutes of the most recent BIB open meeting; (2) the Chairman's
report; (3) RFE/RL Interim President's report; (4) new business; and (5) set the date of the next meeting.

CLOSED MEETINGS: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The open session of the BIB meeting will be followed by a closed meeting of the Board of Directors of RFE/RL, Inc., a nonprofit
private corporation. After completion of this corporate meeting in the afternoon of April 14, the members of the BIB
will reconvene in closed session, if necessary. They would consider the potential use of grant funds to achieve budget
reductions consistent with the broad foreign policy objectives of the United States. This BIB meeting would be closed,
therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552b(c) (1), (2), and (9)(B). Premature disclosure of the information discussed
would likely (1) significantly frustrate implementation of proposed agency action, including but not limited to
negotiations abroad; (2) disclose matters that would be properly classified to be kept secret in the interests of
foreign policy; and (3) in some instances, relate solely to internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
