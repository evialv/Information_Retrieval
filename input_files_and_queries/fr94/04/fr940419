I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To comply with Executive Order 12699 of January 5, 1990, the DOE initially changed its Financial Assistance Rules
on February 2, 1992. At the time the Rules were amended, the Uniform Building Code was the only code/standard judged
to be ``substantially equivalent'' to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program's Recommended Provisions
for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings, 1988 Edition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 4, 1992, the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC), acting in accordance with
E.O. 12699, issued a recommendation to the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) finding that specified
versions of three of the four model building codes reviewed ``provide a level of seismic safety that is substantially
equivalent to the Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic Regulations for New Buildings, 1988 Edition
(FEMA 222 and 223)'' (see appendix C of the Guidelines and Procedures for Implementation of the Executive Order on
Seismic Safety of New Building Construction, ICSSC RP 2.1A, NISTIR 4852, June 1992). Following this ``certification,''
the DOE again proposed changes to the Financial Assistance Rules to permit the use of all model building codes found
to be acceptable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When other codes and/or standards are found acceptable, such as the ASCE 7&hyph;93 Standard (for seismic loads),
the DOE will initiate appropriate changes to the Financial Assistance Rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Changes to 10 CFR Part 600 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 600.12(c) is revised to identify additional building codes which would meet the seismic safety requirements
of the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion of Comments on Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment was received. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) stated that the DOE should adopt ASCE Standard
7&hyph;93 for seismic loads in the Financial Assistance Rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is unable to adopt the ASCE comment at this time. The ASCE proposal can be considered when ASCE Standard
7&hyph;93 has been found by the Interagency Committee on Seismic Safety in Construction (ICSSC) to provide a level
of seismic safety that is substantially equivalent to the Recommended Provisions for the Development of Seismic
Regulations for New Buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASCE comment has been forwarded to the Chairman of the ICSSC of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program
for consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Review Under Executive Order 12612 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other policy actions be reviewed for
any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or in
the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government. If there are sufficient substantial
direct effects, then the Executive Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions
involved in promulgating and implementing a policy action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's rule will revise certain policy and procedural requirements. However, DOE has determined that the revision
will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional functions of States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Regulatory Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order
12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject
to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164,
which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; i.e., small businesses, small organizations, and small
governmental jurisdictions. DOE has concluded that the final rule would only affect small entities as they apply
for and receive financial assistance, and does not create additional economic impact on small entities as a whole.
DOE certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposed upon the public by this rulemaking. Accordingly,
no OMB clearance is required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., or OMB implementing regulations at 5 CFR part 1320. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has concluded that promulgation of this final rule clearly would not represent a major Federal action having significant
impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1976)), the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), and DOE guidelines (10
CFR part 1021) and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement pursuant to NEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IX. Review Under Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. DOE certifies that today's final rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b) of Executive Order 12778.

(c) Provisions shall be made to design and construct all buildings, in which DOE funds are used, to meet appropriate
seismic design and construction standards. Seismic codes and standards meeting or exceeding the provisions of each
of the model codes listed in this paragraph are considered to be appropriate for purposes of this part. The model codes
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 1991 Uniform Building Code, of the International Council of Building Officials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 1992 Supplement to the National Building Code, of the Building Officials and Code Administrators International,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its regulations to incorporate a number of technical and conforming
amendments. The amendments include a global revision to reflect the change from the MACRO to the CAMEL rating system
used by the other federal banking regulatory agencies and a reinstatement of the definition of ``affiliated person''
that was inadvertently removed. The rule also revises OTS's organizational regulations to reflect current titles
and makes technical corrections to provisions concerning bylaws and charter reissuance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OTS is today adopting several technical amendments to its regulations to implement the new rating system for savings
associations, to reinstate a definitional provision, to update organizational titles and addresses and correct
an erroneous cross-reference. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

CAMEL Rating System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OTS is amending its regulations to reflect the conversion from the MACRO to the CAMEL rating system. The purpose
of the conversion is to reduce regulatory burden by using the same rating system employed by the other federal banking
regulatory agencies. The MACRO system currently used by the OTS is very similar to the FDIC's CAMEL policy guidance.
The conversion is intended to improve consistency with regard to risk-based assessments and joint examinations.
The OTS expects there to be virtually no practical effect on savings associations as a result of this change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

The appendix to part 544 which sets forth model bylaws for mutual savings associations is being amended to bring it
into conformity with &sect;544.5(b)(8). The appendix to part 552 containing model bylaws for stock associations
is being revised to bring it into conformity with &sect;552.6&hyph;1(h). A conforming change is also being made to
&sect;552.6(d), based upon the model bylaws contained in the appendix. The provisions undergoing amendment specify
the amount of notice to be given prior to certain meetings of boards of directors and state when voting lists are to be
prepared and how the meetings may be conducted. Section 552.4 concerning charter reissuance is also being revised
to correct an erroneous cross-reference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, the OTS has found good cause to dispense with both prior notice and comment on this final rule
and a thirty-day delay of its effective date. OTS believes that it is contrary to public interest to delay the effective
date of the rule, as it brings the OTS's regulations into conformity with the current rating system. The OTS believes
that it is in the best interest of savings associations for the implementing regulations to be amended at the time the
rating system is changed. The other amendments are purely technical corrections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria was applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard
for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPS). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs by FDC/P NOTAMs,
the TERPS criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPS. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 This document amends the Customs Regulations to extend the time limit allowed to vessel operators to file documentation
submitted in connection with vessel repair entries, including applications for relief from the assessment of duties
under the vessel repair statute. It also amends the regulations to require that any shipyard cost estimates available
be submitted at the time that a vessel repair entry is made. These changes will expedite the decision process in determining

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 13, 1993, a document was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 4114) soliciting comments regarding a Customs proposal to amend the Customs Regulations regarding the time
limit available for the submission of documentation in support of required vessel repair entries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1466 of title 19 of the United States Code provides that a duty of 50 per cent ad valorem shall be assessed upon
the value of repairs accomplished outside of the United States on certain American-flag vessels. The statute itself
and numerous judicial and administrative interpretations provide exceptions to the assessment of duty under specific
circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory mandate is implemented under section 4.14 of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.14), which provides
the necessary working guidelines for Customs as well as vessel operators. Among the matters set forth in &sect;4.14
are the procedures for making entry and for seeking administrative refund or remission of assessed duty. It is required
that American-flag vessels submit a vessel repair entry to Customs within 5 days of arrival from a foreign port following
any shipyard work. Depending upon whether actual shipyard invoices are available at the time an entry is submitted,
the regulations provide that such entry may be denominated either a complete or incomplete submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations provide, absent the grant of an extension, that in the case of entries submitted as incomplete accounts,
a full and complete account of foreign shipyard costs incurred must be submitted to Customs within 60 days from the
date of vessel arrival in the United States (19 CFR 4.14(b)(2)(ii)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has long been heard from vessel operators that the matter of final charges is frequently the subject of negotiation
between themselves and foreign shipyards. It was claimed that this process often makes it impossible to meet the regulatory
submission deadline without the necessity of seeking an extension from Customs. Customs had been reluctant to extend
the filing period, recognizing that extending the period for the gathering of all evidence has the inevitable effect
of delaying the eventual collection of the revenue. Customs has come to believe, however, that such a delay already
existed owing to the large number of operators seeking extensions, and that a savings could be realized by not having
to process numerous requests for extension. With publication of the January 13, 1993, notice, Customs proposed extending
the filing period from the 60-day limit to a period of 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, Customs took the opportunity to propose an additional amendment to the vessel repair regulations.
In the case of vessel repair entries submitted as incomplete accounts, Customs requires that the best estimate of
foreign repair costs be provided pending receipt of actual final invoices. Such statements of cost are used to calculate
the amount of the bond or duties that must be deposited with Customs prior to departure of vessels from port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been noted that on some occasions, final invoice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts vary greatly from initially estimated costs, and that the revenue has been inadequately protected by small
deposits or bonds. It is also known that in many cases, written estimates from foreign shipyards have been provided
to vessel operators prior to the commencement of repair operations. Customs merely proposed to require that when
a written estimate has been provided to a vessel operator, documentary evidence of that estimated cost must be filed
at the time of submission of an incomplete vessel repair entry.

Discussion of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five comments were received in response to the proposal. Four were from vessel operators and interested industry
members, and one was from within the Customs Service. A discussion of the specific comments follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The additional time proposed to submit documentation is needed and its addition is welcomed. However, a major and
much more general review of the regulations should be undertaken. As for the proposal to require the submission of
written cost estimates which may be in the possession of a vessel operator, that element should be deleted. Such estimates
are not always accurate and inclusion of this element in the regulations may be interpreted by Customs officers in
the field as a requirement for all vessel entries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs is planning to undertake a total revision of the vessel regulations, to include those governing vessel repair
matters, as soon as practicable. As to the accuracy of written estimates, Customs prefers to have some written benchmark
for establishing cost rather than just a best guess. Further, there are only three Vessel Repair Liquidation Units,
all of which are familiar with and well practiced at applying the Customs Regulations. All three Units are in frequent
contact with Customs Headquarters and thus any interpretive problems could be quickly resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The focus should be on elimination of the 50 per cent duty on foreign repairs to United States vessels. The duty is an
operational and administrative burden to vessel operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comment is non-responsive to the published notice and solicitation of comments. The Customs Service merely enforces
the statute as enacted by the Congress. Any change regarding the amount of the vessel repair duty would require Congressional
action. If repeal of the statute is desired, it would be appropriate to lobby the Congress and not Customs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While in general agreement with the proposal, it should be recognized that the final cost of foreign repairs is invariably
less than the written estimates received from shipyards. It is unfair to liquidate entries 90 days after entry based
upon such high estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the initial filing period, the regulations also provide for a 30-day field-granted filing extension
as well as an additional filing extension of unspecified length to be granted by Customs Headquarters. These combined
periods in addition to the initial 90 days should provide sufficient time to obtain final cost figures upon which liquidation
may be based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The extension to a 90-day filing period is needed and welcomed. In regard to the additional element concerning the
submission of cost estimates, the wording of the proposal should be altered to make it clear that actual estimate documents
need not be submitted, and that only the estimated cost amounts are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs does not expect cost estimates to be obtained by all vessel operators anticipating the filing of vessel entries.
However, to the extent that such documentation already exists, Customs does not believe it to be overly burdensome
to require the submission of copies of those documents. Given the fact that the regulations allow five working days
after arrival for the submission of a vessel repair entry, it should be possible to provide existing written cost estimates
to Customs by the time the entry process is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The addition of 30 days to the filing time is unnecessary and will only serve to further delay the entry liquidation
process. Further, the language of the proposal should have been written to require the submission of written estimates
with all entries which are filed as incomplete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Customs disagrees. The proposal was limited to requiring the submission of existing estimated cost documents. Customs
does not wish to require that each operator generate new documentation and submit it during the entry process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of all comments received and further review of the matter, it has been determined that
the amendments should be adopted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is certified that the amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Accordingly, they are not subject to the regulatory analysis or other requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD's regulation at 24 CFR 24.700 is being amended to eliminate the designation of authority to order Limited Denials
of Participation (LDP) by specifically listed positions. The positions listed will not be accurate after HUD's Field
Office restructuring because the positions and functions of certain Department officials will be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In November 1993, the Secretary announced the reorganization of HUD's field structure to improve HUD's performance
and provide HUD's customers_members of the public and program beneficiaries_more efficient service and less bureaucracy
by empowering HUD employees to serve HUD's customers more effectively. In implementing this objective, the Secretary
determined to remove the Regional organizational layer and provide officials at lower organizational levels full
authority to carry out program functions, with these field office officials reporting directly to program officials.
The ordering of LDP actions will assist in achieving the Secretary's objective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, &sect;24.700 designates authority to order LDPs to Regional Administrators, Office Managers, the Director
of an Office of Indian Programs, or the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Single Family Housing. This amendment will
give a broad designation of authority to unspecified Department officials, similar to the authority set forth in
HUD's debarment regulations at &sect;24.105(g). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 11, 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12861, which requires each Executive department and
agency to undertake to eliminate within three years of the effective date of the Order not less than 50 percent of its
civilian internal management regulations that are not required by law. Section 24.700 is a civilian internal management
regulation of the type referenced in the Executive Order. The Secretary of HUD has determined that listing specific
position titles in 24 CFR 24.700 is not required by law and can be accomplished through published delegations of authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice of Delegation from the Secretary, delegating the Secretary's Authority to order LDPs to the Department's
Assistant Secretaries, with authority to redelegate, was published on April 15, 1994 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Justification for Final Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, &sect;10.1 provides that notice and public procedure
may be omitted with respect to rules governing the Department's organization or its own internal practices or procedures.
The amendment being made in this document is such a rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to internal administrative procedures
whose content does not relate to the physical condition of project areas or building sites and, therefore, are categorically
excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The rule eliminates unnecessary regulations. There are no anticompetitive discriminatory
aspects of the rule with regard to small entities, and there are not any unusual procedures that would need to be complied
with by small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule is limited
to eliminating unnecessary or duplicative regulations.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will result
from promulgation of this rule, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulation for public housing development provides, in part, at 24 CFR 941.206(c), that PHA acquisition
of properties (with or without rehabilitation) that are secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage or are owned
by HUD may not be approved, except with the prior written approval of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian
Housing. This rule amends &sect;941.206(c) by removing the requirement for prior approval by the Assistant Secretary
and by adding properties owned by the Veterans Administration (VA) or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) as eligible
for acquisition under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also streamlines the procedure for acquiring such properties by expanding the limited proposal procedure
for scattered-site projects to permit the PHA purchase of HUD/VA/RTC properties, any combination of such, and/or
in combination with the purchase of eligible properties on the open market. The limited proposal procedure would
be the same for any single family acquisition regardless of its ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule permits Field Offices to exercise more discretion in determining the nature and scope of required reviews.
In order to enable a Field Office to have the ability to limit its reviews and expedite processing, the PHA is required
to certify, either as part of its limited proposal or at the time the PHA identifies a property it wants to acquire and
provides the proposed sales contract, that compliance with all necessary applicable requirements will be met: e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Prevailing wages; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nondiscrimination requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Site and neighborhood standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Intergovernmental review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Accessibility requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Relocation requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Minimum Property Standards (MPS) or Housing Quality Standards (HQS); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If replacement housing under section 18 is involved, that the housing to be acquired is consistent with the replacement
housing plan approved by HUD; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Generally, properties constructed prior to 1978 should not be considered; however, if a proposed property was
built prior to 1978, that lead-based paint testing and the determination of the cost feasibility of abatement will
be done before the transfer of title to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. These PHA certifications do not
provide a basis for waiving or dispensing with the applicability of the aforementioned requirements, environmental
assessments and other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the PHA's submission, including the certifications, each Field Office is allowed to decide, on its own discretion,
whether or not to require the submission, technical review and approval of any further information. In order to expedite
processing, the Field Office's Housing Specialist will distribute simultaneously to each of HUD's technical offices
(in accordance with the recent reorganization at the Field Office level) the PHA's submission to determine as soon
as possible if any technical reviews are necessary. The Field Office is responsible for performing the reviews to
assure compliance with applicable requirements and development within the approved development cost limits, while
at the same time keeping the number of technical reviews at a minimum. Under this rule, there is a target period of 50
days from the time the PHA indicates it wants to acquire a specific property and when the Field Office approves or rejects
the request; after approval notification, the PHA has an additional 10 day target period to close on the property.
Properties involving extensive rehabilitation, lead-based paint testing and abatement, historic preservation
requirements and/or an uncompleted environmental assessment, may require extension of the target date. The payment
of Single Family Property Disposition (SFPD) customary extension fees is considered an eligible public housing
development expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule provides guidance on the factors that a Field Office is to consider in deciding whether or not to require additional
submissions for review and approval. The Field Office is to take into account the total development cost of the proposed
project, and the management and development capabilities of the PHA, including the PHA's performance rating under
the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) at 24 CFR part 901. The Field Office can, at its own discretion,
accept all PHA certifications that required compliances will be met, except the environmental assessment; by law,
only HUD can certify compliance with 24 CFR part 50. If the Field Office is satisfied with the PHA submission, including
its certifications, additional submissions and technical reviews will not be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes to HUD's development review process are a part of the overall effort that the Department is undertaking
to promote decentralization. More authority is entrusted to the Field Offices to exercise discretion with respect
to the activities of PHAs that they deal with on a close and regular basis. PHAs are themselves empowered to act without
the prior approval of the Assistant Secretary and with the potential for more informal consultations with the Field
Office. The end result is anticipated to be a more streamlined and efficient property acquisition process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule further specifies that the limited proposal procedure under &sect;941.404(n) for scattered site properties
would also be followed for acquisition of HUD/VA/RTC properties. PHAs may identify such properties to consider for
acquisition as described below in the succeeding paragraph. Section 941.404(n) is amended to include these properties
within its scope, and to include the list of certifications discussed above. The unnumbered closing paragraph of
&sect;941.404(n) is revised to reflect the Department's streamlined review procedures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Acquisition by PHAs of HUD's single family acquired properties must routinely follow the established current procedures
used by HUD's Division of Single Family Property Disposition (SFPD). This includes the process by which all other
nonprofit organizations and government agencies purchase properties. After a PHA receives notice of property availability,
the PHA has 5 days to indicate interest and then an additional 15 days to submit a signed sales contract. Upon execution
of the contract by SFPD, the PHA will close the sale within the Field Office closing timeframe, generally 30&hyph;60
days. During this remaining period, all regulatory and statutory regulations must be met by the PHA before the transfer
of title to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD would like to expedite sales to PHAs and encourages PHAs to contact the Director of Housing Management in the HUD
field office having jurisdiction over the area in which the PHA has authority to determine the availability of HUD-owned
single family properties, and the status of HUD-held mortgages which may be in the process of being foreclosed.

Purchase of Properties Owned by the Veteran's Administration (VA) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement between the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Secretary of
Veteran Affairs, a framework will be established for a continuing working relationship between HUD and VA to coordinate
the sale of VA-acquired properties to PHAs. Upon request, the local VA field office will make available a list, by computer
or otherwise, of single family (one to four units) properties owned by VA and located within the PHA's jurisdiction.
PHAs will have a right of first option on these properties for a period of time from the date the list is furnished to the
PHA, and the PHA and VA will follow an agreed upon procedure for the property purchase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to RTC properties, RTC sells foreclosed single family properties in conjunction with its responsibilities
for resolving failed financial institutions. Under the RTC's Affordable Housing Disposition (AHD) Program, public
agencies, nonprofit organizations and low/moderate-income buyers have an exclusive right for a period of time to
purchase lower-priced single family properties that the RTC has placed on the market. RTC offers these properties
at their fair market value and publicizes the availability of these properties through various state and local housing
agencies and Federal Home Loan Banks, which serve as property information clearinghouses. PHAs are to contact the
Affordable Housing Disposition Department Head at the local RTC field offices in order to be placed on the RTC property
mailing list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has determined that the changes made by this rule should be adopted without the delay occasioned by
requiring prior notice and comment. These changes primarily constitute a change in the Department's own review procedures
and the elimination of a requirement to obtain prior approval of the Assistant Secretary before a PHA may acquire certain
properties. As such, prior notice and comment are unnecessary, and the rule is exempt under 24 CFR part 10 from notice
and comment requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule do not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under
the Order. This rule removes a layer of prior HUD review and approval and allows Field Offices to exercise more discretion
at multiple processing stages for the acquisition of certain properties. It will not have substantial, direct effects
on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationships with the Federal government, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that this
rule will have only an indirect, though beneficial, impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
since it should simplify the development of housing by PHAs, and thus, is not subject to review under the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not listed in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Proposals for the acquisition of single family properties (with or without rehabilitation) that are secured
by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage or are owned by HUD, the Veterans Administration (VA), or the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC), must be submitted to the Field Office for approval. The limited proposal procedure for scattered-site
projects, as set forth at 24 CFR 941.404(n), may be followed to facilitate the PHA purchase for scattered-site projects
of HUD/VA/RTC properties, any combination of such, and/or in combination with the purchase of eligible properties
on the open market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After approval of the limited proposal and execution of the ACC, Field Offices will determine the nature and scope
of required technical reviews, taking into consideration the PHA submission identifying a property it wants to acquire
that includes the proposed sales contract and PHA certifications that compliance with all necessary requirements
will be met. If the PHA has provided the certifications as part of its limited proposal, the Field Office can, at its
own discretion, accept all PHA certifications that required compliances will be met except the environmental assessment;
by law, only HUD can certify compliance with 24 CFR part 50. The PHA certifications do not waive or dispense with the
applicability of other Federal requirements pursuant to 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209, but only serve to facilitate
the approval process. These certifications shall address, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prevailing wages; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Nondiscrimination requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Site and neighborhood standards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Intergovernmental review; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Accessibility requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Relocation requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Minimum Property Standards (MPS) or Housing Quality Standards (HQS); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) If replacement housing under section 18 is involved, that the housing to be acquired is consistent with the
Replacement Housing Plan approved by HUD; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Generally, properties constructed prior to 1978 should not be considered; however, if a proposed property was
built prior to 1978, that lead-based paint testing and the determination of the cost feasibility of abatement will
be done before the transfer to and payment of funds by the PHA or the contract is null and void; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After receiving a PHA's submission in accordance with paragraph (c) (2) of this section, each Field Office will
decide whether or not to require the review and approval of any further information, based on its consideration of
the PHA's submission, the acquisition cost of the property, and the management and development capabilities of the
PHA, including the PHA's performance rating, under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) at
24 CFR part 901. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Field Office will perform all necessary reviews to assure all compliance requirements are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Under this section, there is a target period of 50 days from the time the PHA indicates it wants to acquire a specific
property and when the Field Office approves or rejects the request; after approval notification, the PHA has an additional
10 day target period in which to close on the property. Properties involving additional requirements, such as acquisition
with extensive rehabilitation, lead-based paint testing and abatement, historic preservation requirements and/or
an uncompleted environmental assessment, may require extension of the target date.

 (1) PHAs may, in lieu of submission of the complete proposal described in this section, submit a limited proposal if:
the proposal is for the acquisition of properties secured by an FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgage, or owned by HUD,
the Veterans Administration (VA), or the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC); or the proposal is for a project involving
scattered-site acquisition or a scattered-site conventional new construction or rehabilitation development,
and the proposal has been determined to be eligible for front-end funding pursuant to &sect;941.402(c) or &sect;941.403(c),
and the diversity of ownership of the properties is expected to make site control difficult.

(J) Any other Federal requirements listed under 24 CFR 941.202 through 941.209. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HUD will review the limited proposal, in accordance with &sect;941.405, and upon approval of the proposal, HUD
will execute the ACC and permit advances for the purposes and amounts described in &sect;941.406(b)(3). The PHA will
select individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties in accordance with its approved limited proposal, but will not acquire a property or make a commitment
to acquire without specific HUD site approval, and a determination that the property, including the resulting total
development cost, is consistent with the approved limited proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 15, 1992, MSHA published a final rule revising its safety standards for ventilation of underground coal mines
(57 FR 20868). These standards were to take effect on August 16, 1992. On August 6, 1992, MSHA delayed the effective
date of the rule until November 16, 1992, to allow mine operators time to effectively plan and implement necessary
changes (57 FR 34683). On November 13, 1992, as a result of discussions with the mining community, MSHA administratively
stayed the effective date of &sect;&sect;75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) until July 1, 1993 (57 FR 53856). Section 75.313
was stayed to allow MSHA to further evaluate the effect of fan stoppages in certain mines. Section 75.344(a)(1) was
stayed to evaluate whether requiring portable compressors to be located in a noncombustible structure or area could
create a fire hazard due to overheating. MSHA also recodified the provisions these standards were to replace as &sect;&sect;75.314,
75.315 and 75.345. On June 7, 1993, MSHA extended the stay until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 31908). Consistent with the stay
extension, the recodified provisions continue in effect until July 1, 1994 (58 FR 33996). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of meetings with the mining public and further review of the ventilation rule, the Agency is initiating
a rulemaking to address the issues which prompted the stay. On December 30, 1993, MSHA published a notice (58 FR 69312)
proposing to extend the stay until completion of a rulemaking involving these and other ventilation standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency received comments from interested parties concurring with the proposed extension. By this notice the
Agency is extending the stay of &sect;&sect;75.313 and 75.344(a)(1) until completion of the ventilation rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice does not affect the indefinite suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;75.321(a) (57 FR 55457). That action was in response to an order of the United States Court of Appeals which stayed
&sect;75.321(a) indefinitely, pending court review.

in advance of the event. Publishing a NPRM and delaying the event would be contrary to public interest since the fireworks
display is for public viewing.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 4, 1994, the Burlington Department of Parks and Recreation submitted an application to hold a fireworks program
at Burlington Waterfront Park, Burlington, Vermont. This regulation establishes a temporary safety zone in all
waters of Burlington Harbor within 250 feet of a point located on the southern corner of Burlington Waterfront Park
at or near 44

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;

&rsquo; W longitude. This safety zone is needed to protect boaters from the hazards associated with fireworks exploding
in the area. No vessel will be permitted to enter or move within this safety zone unless authorized to do so by the Coast
Guard Captain of the Port, New York.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not major under Executive Order 12291 and not significant under Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). No vessel traffic is permitted to transit within
250 feet of a point located on the southern corner of Burlington Waterfront Park in Burlington Harbor. Due to the limited
duration of the event, the extensive advisories that will be made, and the limited traffic in the area at this time,
and the fact that vessel traffic can safely transit around this zone, the Coast Guard expects the economic impact of
this regulation to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this regulation
will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently
owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business
concerns'' under Section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons given in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the impact of this regulation to be minimal.
The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is establishing a Regulated Navigation Area at the Oliver Lock and Dam at MM 338 of the Black Warrior
River. This regulation places restrictions on downbound tows passing through the lock during periods of high Tail-Water
Gauge readings. Strong currents exist during high water conditions below the lock and dam that set downbound tows
against the right protruding bank. The regulations applicable in this regulated navigation area in high water conditions
will alleviate this problem.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation, and good cause
exists for making it effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures
would have been contrary to the public interest. Several near miss marine casualties have occurred previously as
a result of the conditions cited above. Immediate action is needed to prevent marine casualties and to protect the
environment during instances of high water.

Discussion of Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These regulations have been established to decrease the risk of a marine casualty or oil pollution incident below
the Oliver Lock and Dam. During normal river conditions, a tow leaving the lock has the current coming over the dam moving
the tow to the right, making it difficult to move away from the lock wall and the right bank. The tows must navigate around
a point of land on the right descending bank, which is fortified with rip-rap. In order to avoid this bank, they must
offset the current by powering toward the Hunt Oil Dock located on the left descending bank in the same area. This situation
is hazardous as a tow may be pushed into the right descending bank or ram crude oil barges docked at Hunt Oil, causing
a major marine casualty or pollution incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recent incomplete removal of the deflector dike on the downstream side of the Oliver Lock and Dam has accentuated
the problem of currents pushing downbound tows toward the right protruding bank as they exit the lock. However, the
problem will continue after removal of the remainder of the deflector dike. In higher water conditions, the currents
are stronger and therefore the situation is even more hazardous. Already these conditions have resulted in many near
misses, as reported by many of the towing companies using the lock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard seeks to alleviate this situation by limiting tow sizes as the water level increases. This makes maneuvering
easier for towboat operators because smaller tows have less area for the current to affect and because smaller tows
increase the horsepower per ton ratio for the tow. Prohibiting downbound oil or hazardous material barges from transitting
the lock when the river is exceptionally high will alleviate the danger of those products being released due to the
hazardous downbound conditions should a tow and barge have difficulty navigating due to these hazardous downbound
conditions.

Economic Assessment and Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation is not considered to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is nonsignificant
under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic
impact has been found to be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. This is based on the following
historic data provided by the Army Corps of Engineers for percentage of days per year on which conditions exist on the
Black Warrior River that would require compliance with this regulation: a Tail-Water Gauge reading of 102.3 feet
or less_78% or 285 days per year; a Tail-Water Gauge reading of 102.3 feet to 112.3 feet_16% or 58 days per year; a Tail-Water
Gauge reading of 112.3 feet or greater_6% or 22 days per year. Normal high water periods are during the months of January
through April. Transit statistics for the Black Warrior and Tombigbee Rivers for the most recent year for which such
statistics are available, 1989, indicate that there were 8,110 towboat transits, including 1,517 tank barge transits,
which may be potentially affected by these regulations. Additionally, the Coast Guard certifies that this regulation
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is making the deep draft channel between Narragansett Bay Entrance Lighted Horn Buoy NB (LLNR 17675)
and Providence River Channel Light 42 (LLNR 18580, Fuller Rock Light), a Regulated Navigation Area (RNA). This action
is necessary to protect the maritime community from the hazards to navigation associated with the extreme shoaling
that has taken place within the Providence River channel.

Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 17, 1993, the Captain of the Port, Providence, signed an emergency Safety Zone Regulation for the Providence
River Channel. This regulation was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14151). The Captain of the Port, Providence requested comments concerning the safety zone
regulation and received none. This emergency Safety Zone Regulation imposed restrictions on vessel traffic pertaining
to maximum allowable drafts, one way traffic, and communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposing the establishment of a Regulated Navigation
Area in the Providence River in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65684). That NPRM differed from the emergency safety zone regulations by enlarging the
area which is regulated, adding a restriction concerning operations in reduced visibility, and reducing the number
of SECURITE call locations for outbound vessels. No letters or comments on the proposed rule were received. Therefore,
the Coast Guard is publishing the final regulation as proposed. Public hearings were not requested and none were held.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February of 1993, the Captain of the Port, Providence, received the results of a hydrographic survey of the Providence
River Federal navigation channel. This survey conducted by the Army Corps of Engineers showed that serious shoaling
was taking place in the northern section of the channel. To provide for the safety of the port, the Captain of the Port,
Providence, published an emergency Safety Zone regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14151). Comments were solicited and none were received. A task force to study the need for dredging
in the affected areas was organized by the state. However, due to the contamination of the dredge spoils and local environmental
concerns, a decision is not expected in the near future. The finalizing of this RNA will allow the Coast Guard to regulate
vessel traffic over an extended period of time. It is designed to protect the Port of Providence from any deep draft
vessel casualty due to shoaling that may result in a grounding or associated casualty leading to loss of life, injury,
property loss, oil or hazardous material discharge, or blockage of the channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing safety zone regulating vessel traffic in the effected area will expire on May 1, 1994. In the interest
of safety and the public's interest in maintaining continuity in the regulations governing vessel traffic in this
area, good cause exists for having this rule, which is nearly identical to the regulations that have been in effect
since February 17, 1993, take effect on May 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects
the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The emergency regulations
have been in effect since February 17, 1993. Commercial operators utilizing the Port of Providence have reported
no problems or economic burdens due to these regulations. The volume of commercial traffic utilizing this waterway
is such that the costs incurred due to delays because of one-way traffic or reduced visibility are considered minimal
and are far outweighed by the extra measures of safety provided by the regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the Coast Guard expects the
economic impact of this rule to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b)
that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is approving a State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of West Virginia. This revision
establishes and requires that the degree of emission limitation required for the control of any air pollutant is not
affected by that portion of the stack height which exceeds good engineering practice (GEP) or by any other dispersion
technique. The revision is consistent with the stack height provisions under EPA's ``Requirements for Preparation,
Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans_Control Strategy''. The intended effect of this action is to approve
a SIP revision consisting of a stack height regulation adopted by the State of West Virginia. The State adopted this
regulation to conform to the July 8, 1985 Federal promulgation of a revised stack height regulation. This action is
being taken under section 110 of the Clean Air Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 2, 1990, the West Virginia Department of Commerce, Labor, and Environmental Resources submitted a revision
to its State implementation plan (SIP) to incorporate a regulation for good engineering practice (GEP) as it applies
to stack heights. The revision consists of West Virginia Air Pollution Control Commission (WVAPCC) Regulation 20_``Good
Engineering Practice as Applies to Stack Heights'' (45CSR20), adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on April
8, 1989 and effective July 14, 1989. The SIP revision is consistent with EPA's revised stack height regulation as published
in the July 8, 1985 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 8, 1985, EPA promulgated a revised stack height regulation to ensure that the degree of emission limitation
required for the control of any pollutant under an applicable SIP is not affected by that portion of any stack height
which exceeds GEP or by any other dispersion technique (See 50 FR 27892). The regulation updated the rule promulgated
on February 8, 1982 at 47 FR 5864.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 2, 1990, the State of West Virginia responded to the July 8, 1985

EPA Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated West Virginia's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The stack height requirements
will not adversely affect West Virginia's ability to enforce the current applicable emission limitations which
adequately protect the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS); (2) the stack height requirements are clearly
enforceable; and (3) the applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 51 have been met. A more detailed evaluation is provided
in a Technical Support Document available upon request from the Regional EPA office listed in the

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to West Virginia's regulations have been effective in the State
since July 14, 1989. This action will be effective June 20, 1994 unless, by May 19, 1994, notice is received that adverse
or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective
date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another
will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments
are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 20, 1994.

Final Action

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the WVAPCC Regulation 20_``Good Engineering Practice as Applies to Stack Heights'' (45CSR20) submitted
by the State of West Virginia as a revision to the West Virginia SIP. EPA's review of West Virginia's stack height regulation
indicates that it conforms to the requirements of 40 CFR parts 51 and 52, and to the July 8, 1985 Federal promulgation
of a revised stack height regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action
conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 20, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

 43 CFR Part 230 pertains to the management of water rights for individuals receiving benefits from Bureau of Reclamation
(Reclamation) irrigation projects. This regulation is outdated because current procedures for managing water
rights conform to State requirements rather than procedures stated in this regulation. This regulation is no longer
applicable to Reclamation programs, and so it is being removed from the Code of Federal Regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
43 CFR Part 406 was written in the 1950's to help carry out the Farm Unit Exchange Act (Act of August 13, 1953, 67 Stat.
556) that provides for the exchange of certain unpatented farm units or private land on a Federal irrigation project,
for certain classes of qualified applicants whose lands have been determined, pursuant to a land classification,
to be insufficient to support a family, and the amendment of farm units by the addition of contiguous or noncontiguous
land on the same project. All farm units that were eligible for exchange have been exchanged, and since the program
is no longer active, this regulation is no longer applicable to Reclamation programs, and so it is being removed from
the Code of Federal Regulations.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding adopts rules to implement sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934 (the
Act), as amended by section 6000(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). The new rules adopted:
interpret the elements that define the terms ``commercial mobile radio service (CMRS)'' and ``private mobile radio
service (PMRS);'' based on these definitions, determine the regulatory status of existing mobile services and of
personal communications services (PCS); address the degree to which those services that will be classified as CMRS
will be subject to regulation under Title II of the Act; and address the other issues, including interconnection rights
and preemption of state regulatory authority over mobile service providers. The Commission's action furthers the
congressional objectives of ensuring that similar services are subject to consistent regulatory classification
and that appropriate levels of regulation be established for CMRS providers. The Commission's action establishes
a symmetrical regulatory structure that will promote competition in the mobile services marketplace and will serve
the interests of consumers while also benefiting the national economy.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 604, a final regulatory flexibility analysis
has been prepared and is presented below. It is available for public viewing as part of the full text of this decision,
which may be obtained from the Commission or its copy contractor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 603 of title 5, United States Code, 5 U.S.C. 603, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was
incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252. Written comments on the proposals
in the Notice, including the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, were requested.

A. Need for and Purpose of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act. The rules
adopted herein will carry out the intent of Congress to establish a uniform regulatory framework for all mobile services.

B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While all the parties recognize that this rulemaking will impose new legal obligations on licensees whose regulatory
status has changed from private to commercial as a result of the new legislation and the actions we have taken in this
Order, a number of parties propose that licensees should be able to offer both commercial and private radio service
on the same system and under a single license. As a result of these comments, we have adopted these proposals. As a result
of other comments, we have made modifications to other proposals as appropriate.

C. Significant Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have reduced the burdens wherever possible. In an effort to reduce the burdens on small entities, for example, we
will not impose any tariff filing obligations. In addition, we emphasize that the three-year transition rules adopted
in this Order will allow existing licensees that are subject to reclassification as CMRS providers to continue to
be regulated as private until August 10, 1996. This three-year period will ensure an orderly transition for all reclassified
private licensees that are small entities.

Synopsis of the Second Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 23, 1993, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Notice), 58 FR 53169 (October 14, 1993),
in this proceeding in which we sought comment on: (1) The definitional issues raised in the Budget Act; (2) which existing
mobile services and future mobile services should be classified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' under the
statute and which should be classified as ``private mobile radio services''; and (3) which provisions of Title II
of the Communications Act should not be applied to CMRS. We received 76 comments and 52 reply comments in response to
the Notice in this proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summarizing the actions the Commission has taken in this Order, the following points highlight the decisions made
to implement the objectives of Congress in amending section 332 of the Act. First, the Order gives a comprehensive
scope to the term ``mobile service,'' including within the definition all public mobile services, private land mobile
service, mobile satellite services, and most marine and aviation wireless services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Order defined the term ``commercial mobile radio service'' in a manner that covers a significant portion
of services provided by mobile carriers because of the conclusion that such a definition best serves the congressional
purpose of making mobile services widely available at reasonable rates and on reasonable terms in a competitive marketplace.
There are three prongs to the CMRS definition: The service must be provided for profit, it must be interconnected to
the public switched network, and it must be available to the public or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively
available to a substantial portion of the public. Under the first element of the definition, the Order provides that
``for profit'' includes any mobile service that is provided with the intent of receiving compensation or monetary
gain. In the case of services that are not-for-profit, except for a portion of excess capacity that the licensee offers
with the intent of receiving compensation, the service will be treated as for-profit to the extent of such excess capacity
activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the second element of the CMRS definition, the Order concludes that a mobile service offers interconnected
service if it allows subscribers to send or receive messages to or from anywhere on the public switched network (PSN).
Both direct and indirect interconnection with the PSN satisfy this criterion, as well as the use of store-and-forward
technology. The Order also gives an expansive meaning to the term public switch network, concluding that the network
includes the facilities of common carriers that participate in the North American Numbering Plan and having switching
capability.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the third prong of the definition, the Order decides that service made available ``to the public'' means any
service that is offered without restriction on who may receive it. The Order also concludes that whether a service
is offered to ``such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available to a substantial portion of the public''
depends on several relevant factors, such as the type, nature, and scope of users for whom the service is intended.
The Commission decided not to consider limited system capacity or coverage of small geographic areas as factors in
restricting system availability. If a service is provided only for internal use or only to a specified class of eligible
users under the Commission's rules, then the Order concludes that the service will not meet the ``public availability''
prong of the CMRS definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Order interpreted the term ``private mobile radio service'' by closely adhering to the statutory definition,
and with the aim of advancing the congressional objective of applying a symmetrical regulatory framework to mobile
services. The Order determines that the statutory language and the legislative history support the conclusion that
a mobile service may be classified as PMRS only if it does not fall within the statutory definition of CMRS and is not
the functional equivalent of a service that meets the three-part definition of CMRS. Those services that are classified
as PMRS will, however, be presumed PMRS unless it is demonstrated that the service is the functional equivalent of
CMRS. In applying the functional equivalence test, the Order considers a variety of factors, including whether the
mobile service involved is a close substitute for any CMRS offering as evidenced by the cross-price elasticity of
demand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, applying the definitions discussed above, the Order classifies existing private land mobile services and
common carrier services. For example, all existing Government and Public Safety Services (including the Special
Emergency Radio Service) and all Industrial and Land Transportation Services other than certain Business Radio
Service are classified as PMRS. The Order also classifies Automatic Vehicle Monitoring as a private mobile radio
service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Business Radio Service, which has a broader range of eligible users than other Industrial and Land Transportation
services, the Order classifies Business Radio licensees who provide for-profit interconnected service to third-party
users as CMRS. Business Radio licensees who operate not-for-profit internal systems, or who do not offer interconnected
service, are classified as private.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order classifies Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) licensees as CMRS if they offer interconnected service to customers.
In addition, private carrier paging (PCP) services are classified as CMRS because they fit the statutory definition
of CMRS. The Order concludes, however, those PCP systems that service the licensee's internal communications needs
and do not offer for-profit service to third-party customers will be classified as PMRS. The Order classifies 220&hyph;222
MHz private land mobile systems using the same approach taken by the Order for classifying SMR and PCP licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, with respect to existing common carrier services, the Order classifies as CMRS: Cellular service, 800 MHz
air-ground service, common carrier paging service, mobile telephone service, improved mobile telephone service,
trunked mobile telephone service, 454 MHz air-ground service, and Offshore Radio Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to mobile satellite service, the Order concludes that the Commission will exercise its discretion under
the statute to determine whether the provision of space segment capacity by satellite licensees may be treated as
common carriage. Lastly, the Order concludes that the Commission will seek further comment in a subsequent proceeding
on whether it should remove existing restrictions that bar CMRS providers from offering dispatch service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifth, the Order determines that personal communications services (PCS) should be classified presumptively as
CMRS. Under this approach, a PCS applicant or licensee would be regulated as a CMRS carrier, but would be able to offer
private PCS and be regulated as PMRS, upon making the requisite showing. The Order concludes that treating PCS as presumptively
CMRS most suits the manner in which the Commission has defined PCS, and the four goals that the Commission established
for the service_speed of deployment, universality, competitive delivery, and diversity of services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sixth, the Order states that the Commission has decided to exercise its forbearance authority regarding several
Title II provisions in order to maximize market competition. The Order finds that the Commission's forbearance actions
will promote competition, and that application of the three-pronged test set forth in section 332(c) of the Act warrants
forbearance from many Title II provisions. In general, the Commission has forborne from enforcing any tariffing
requirements, and from exercising Commission authority to investigate into existing and newly filed rates and practices,
to collect intercarrier contracts, to require certification concerning interlocking directorates, and to require
Commission approval relating to market entry and exit (respectively, sections 203, 204, 205, 211, 212, and 214 of
the Act). The Commission, however, did not forbear from provisions that are unrelated to Commission authority and
regulatory obligations (section 210), are primarily reservations of Commission authority (sections 213, 215,
218, 219, and 221), or are consumer protection-related (sections 223, 225, 226, 227, and 228). In addition, in the
case of cellular service, the Order states that the Commission will shortly issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making
to establish monitoring provisions applicable to the cellular marketplace. The Order further provides that the
Commission will issue a Notice of Proposed Rule Making addressing whether the Commission should adopt further forbearance
actions under Title II of the Act in the case of specified classes of CMRS providers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventh, the Order requires local exchange carriers (LECs) to provide reasonable and fair interconnection for all
CMRS because the Commission sees no distinction between cellular carriers to whom LECs are currently required to
provide such interconnection and all other CMRS providers, including PCS providers. The Order also provides that
if a LEC provides interconnection to CMRS providers while denying the same interconnection to PMRS providers, the
carrier would bear the burden of demonstrating why such practice does not constitute a violation of Title II of the
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighth, the Order concludes that Congress, in revising section 332, intended to preempt state and local rate and entry
regulation of all CMRS. The Order establishes a range of procedural and other requirements states must meet if they
seek to retain any existing CMRS rate regulation or initiate such rate regulation for the first time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Order implements provisions of the Budget Act that establish effective dates for the ``regulatory treatment''
amendment to the Communications Act and set forth deadlines for an orderly transition to the changed regulatory structure.
The Budget Act established a three-year transition period during which ``any private land mobile service provided
by any person before such date of enactment, and any paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January
1, 1993, for private land mobile service shall *&blank;*&blank;* be treated as private mobile service.'' With respect
to private land mobile services, the Order interprets this language to mean that the three-year transition applies
to all private land mobile licensees who were licensed, and therefore authorized to provide service, as of August
10, 1993. On the other hand, the Order provides that private mobile licensees who are subject to reclassification
as CMRS and were not licensed as of the enactment date of the Budget Act, are not subject to the three-year ``grandfathering''
period, and will therefore be treated as CMRS as soon as the Commission's rules go into effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission concluded that Congress did not intend the transition period to apply in a rigid fashion to pre-enactment
licensees and that it did intend some flexibility in the implementation of these transition provisions. The Commission
determined, therefore, that it will allow grandfathered licensees to modify and expand existing systems and to acquire
additional licenses in the same service for which they were licensed prior to August 10, 1993. In addition, with respect
to non-grandfathered licensees, the Commission concluded that reclassification should be effective upon the effective
date of the Commission's transitional rules for reclassified services; these rules will be considered in a separate
rule making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to paging services, the Order finds that the transition period applies more broadly. The Commission
concluded that Congress specifically provided that all paging licensees ``utilizing'' private paging frequencies
allocated as of January 1, 1993, are to be treated as private mobile radio service providers for three years. The Commission
noted that the Conference Report accompanying the Budget Act explains that paging was treated separately to prevent
states from attempting to restrict entry of paging licensees on private frequencies prior to the effective date of
the Commission's preemption regulations, which do not go into effect until August 10, 1994. The Commission concluded
that all private paging licensees are to be treated as private mobile service providers, regardless of whether they
were licensed before or after the date of enactment.

mobile radio service by filing a petition for declaratory ruling challenging a mobile service provider's regulatory
treatment as a private mobile radio service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The petition must show that: (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The mobile service in question meets the definition of commercial mobile radio service; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) The mobile service in question is the functional equivalent of a service that meets the definition of a commercial
mobile radio service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) A variety of factors will be evaluated to make a determination whether the mobile service in question is the functional
equivalent of a commercial mobile radio service, including: consumer demand for the service to determine whether
the service is closely substitutable for a commercial mobile radio service; whether changes in price for the service
under examination, or for the comparable commercial mobile radio service would prompt customers to change from one
service to the other; and market research information identifying the targeted market for the service under review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The petition must contain specific allegations of fact supported by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal
knowledge. The petition must be served on the mobile service provider against whom it is filed and contain a certificate
of service to this effect. The mobile service provider may file an opposition to the petition and the petitioner may
file a reply. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in &sect;&sect;1.1 through 1.52 of this chapter
shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Licensees of a Personal Communications Service or applicants for a Personal Communications Service license
proposing to use any Personal Communications Service spectrum to offer service on a private mobile radio service
basis must overcome the presumption that Personal Communications Service is a commercial mobile radio service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The applicant or licensee (who must file an application to modify its authorization) seeking authority to dedicate
a portion of the spectrum for private mobile radio service, must include a certification that it will offer Personal
Communications Service on a private mobile radio service basis. The certification must include a description of
the proposed service sufficient to demonstrate that it is not within the definition of commercial mobile radio service
in &sect;20.3. Any application requesting to use any Personal Communications Service spectrum to offer service
on a private mobile radio service basis will be placed on public notice by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any interested party may file a petition to deny the application within 30 days after the date of public notice announcing
the acceptance for filing of the application. The petition shall contain specific allegations of fact supported
by affidavit(s) of person(s) with personal knowledge to show that the applicant's request does not rebut the commercial
mobile radio service presumption. The petition must be served on the applicant and contain a certificate of service
to this effect. The applicant may file an opposition with allegations of fact supported by affidavit. The petitioner
may file a reply. No additional pleadings will be allowed. The general rules of practice and procedure contained in
&sect;1.1 through &sect;1.52 of this chapter and &sect;22.30 of this chapter shall apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any provider of private land mobile service before August 10, 1993 (including any system expansions, modifications,
or acquisitions of additional licenses in the same service, even if authorized after this date), and any private paging
service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January 1, 1993, that meet the definition of commercial mobile radio
service, shall, except for purposes of &sect;20.5 (applicable August 10, 1993 for the providers listed in this paragraph),
be treated as private mobile radio service until August 10, 1996. After this date, these entities will be treated as
commercial mobile radio service providers regulated under this part.

(1) Demonstrative evidence that market conditions in the state for commercial mobile radio services do not adequately
protect subscribers to such services from unjust and unreasonable rates or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably
discriminatory. Alternatively, a state's petition may include demonstrative evidence showing that market conditions
for commercial mobile radio services do not protect subscribers adequately from unjust and unreasonable rates,
or rates that are unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory, and that a substantial portion of the commercial mobile
radio service subscribers in the state or a specified geographic area have no alternative means of obtaining basic
telephone service. This showing may include evidence of the range of basic telephone service alternatives available
to consumers in the state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of the types of evidence, information, and analysis that may
be considered pertinent to determine market conditions and consumer protection by the Commission in reviewing any
petition filed by a state under this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The number of commercial mobile radio service providers in the state, the types of services offered by commercial
mobile radio service providers in the state, and the period of time that these providers have offered service in the
state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The number of customers of each commercial mobile radio service provider in the state; trends in each provider's
customer base during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data
is unavailable; and annual revenues and rates of return for each commercial mobile radio service provider;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Rate information for each commercial mobile radio service provider, including trends in each provider's rates
during the most recent annual period or other data covering another reasonable period if annual data is unavailable;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) An assessment of the extent to which services offered by the commercial mobile radio service providers the state
proposes to regulate are substitutable for services offered by other carriers in the state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Opportunities for new providers to enter into the provision of competing services, and an analysis of any barriers
to such entry;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Specific allegations of fact (supported by affidavit of person with personal knowledge) regarding anti-competitive
or discriminatory practices or behavior by commercial mobile radio service providers in the state;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Evidence, information, and analysis demonstrating with particularity instances of systematic unjust and
unreasonable rates, or rates that are unjust or unreasonably discriminatory, imposed upon commercial mobile radio
service subscribers. Such evidence should include an examination of the relationship between rates and costs. Additionally,
evidence of a pattern of such rates, that demonstrates the inability of the commercial mobile radio service marketplace
in the state to produce reasonable rates through competitive forces will be considered especially probative; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Information regarding customer satisfaction or dissatisfaction with services offered by commercial mobile
radio service providers, including statistics and other information about complaints filed with the state regulatory
commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Petitions must include a certification that the state agency filing the petition is the duly authorized state
agency responsible for the regulation of telecommunication services provided in the state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Petitions must identify and describe in detail the rules the state proposes to establish if the petition is granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) States have the burden of proof. Interested parties may file comments in support or in opposition to the petition
within 30 days after public notice of the filing of a petition by a state under this section. Any interested party may
file a reply within 15 days after the expiration of the filing period for comments. No additional pleadings may be filed.
Except for &sect;1.45 of this chapter, practice and procedure rules contained in &sect;&sect;1.42&hyph;1.52 of
this chapter shall apply. The provisions of &sect;&sect;1.771&hyph;1.773 of this chapter do not apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If the Commission grants the petition, it shall authorize the state to regulate rates for commercial mobile radio
services in the state during a reasonable period of time, as specified by the Commission. The period of time specified
by the Commission will be that necessary to ensure that rates are just and reasonable, or not unjustly or unreasonably
discriminatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) States that regulated rates for commercial mobile services as of June 1, 1993, may petition the Commission under

reconsideration of the petition are acted upon by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The provisions of paragraph (a)(7) of this section apply to any petition granted by the Commission under this paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS adopts as final, with one change, the interim final rule authorizing the Southwest Regional Director (RD), NMFS,
to require the owner or agent of a vessel with a permit for the longline fishery to make accommodations for a NMFS observer.
This final rule requires permit holders or their designated agents (which may include the vessel operator) to provide
NMFS with at least 72 hours notice (not including weekends and Federal holidays) prior to each departure from port
so the RD can determine if an observer placement will be made. This action is necessary to ensure adequate collection-of-data
on the frequency and nature of interactions between longline fishing gear and sea turtles around Hawaii to ensure
the fishery operates in compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Pelagic fisheries of the western Pacific region, including the longline fishery based in Hawaii, are managed
under a Fishery Management Plan (FMP) that was approved in 1987 and subsequently was amended six times. Rules implementing
the FMP are found at 50 CFR part 685. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement were issued June 10, 1993, concerning the take of sea turtles in
the Hawaii longline fishery. In addition to setting a limit on the incidental take of sea turtles, the Incidental Take
Statement also requires NMFS to establish an observer program (initially through voluntary placements and subsequently
through a mandatory program) to ensure collection of sufficient data to produce statistically significant results
and to evaluate the accuracy of logbooks submitted for the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule provides the administrative mechanism for NMFS to carry out the observer program with general longline
permit holders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An interim final rule establishing the mandatory observer program was published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67699).
In that rule, the observer placement authority was provided under the limited entry permit requirement for longline
vessels under an existing longline limited entry program in Hawaii. It was anticipated that a new limited entry program
would be implemented by an FMP amendment existing at the time the program expires at midnight, April 22, 1994. However,
the proposed FMP amendment (Amendment 7) was not submitted to the Secretary for review and implementation under the
Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) until late January 1994. Under the normal schedule
of the Magnuson Act for action on FMP amendments, the new program (if approved) will not be implemented before mid-June
1994. This means there could be a lapse of 2 months in observer placements due to the lack of a limited entry program and
moratorium permits to which the existing observer requirements apply. If this occurred, there would be a substantial
risk that the incidental take of turtles could erroneously be estimated. This could result in adverse impacts on sea
turtles, if the take of turtles were significantly underestimated and corrective action to protect turtles were
not taken; or adverse impacts on the industry if the take of turtles were overestimated and unnecessary constraints
were imposed on the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule is being adopted as final with one change. The change from the interim final rule is to impose
the observer placement requirements on the owner of a vessel covered by a general longline permit issued under &sect;685.9,
provided any part of the vessel's next fishing trip will occur in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) around Hawaii.
This is a change from the interim rule, which required notification of NMFS by holders of permits issued pursuant to
the current moratorium under &sect;685.15. However, the moratorium, and the permits issued thereunder, are due
to expire April 22, 1994. As explained above, a replacement limited entry program will probably not be implemented
prior to April 22, 1994. Therefore, in order to continue to collect observer data, NMFS needs to modify the observer
requirement to apply to vessels with general longline permits issued under &sect;685.9. These general permits are
currently required and will remain so even with the expiration of the moratorium and implementation of a new limited
entry program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the interim final rule were received from two persons. One commenter emphasized the importance of obtaining
detailed, at-sea data on the longline fishery and fully endorsed the observer program. The other commenter raised
a number of operational concerns tied to the timing of notices prior to fishing trips and of observer placement meetings.
This commenter suggested that more flexibility is needed to accommodate the nature of the fishery and the difficulty
for fishermen to make firm timing commitments regarding vessel departures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No changes have been made in the regulations as a result of these comments. Experience in observer programs in other
fisheries indicates that arrangements usually can be made for modifications when necessary to accommodate changes
in schedules (&sect;685.11(c) (1) and (3)) and delays in departure times or special accommodations for observers
(&sect;685.11(d)). It is recognized that vessel operators may want to make rapid turnaround on trips and may not have
72 hours on shore to contact NMFS concerning the next trip. These operators can contact NMFS through a telephone call
from their vessels at sea, if necessary, to determine if an observer will be required and to arrange the placement,
if necessary. If a vessel's departure is delayed, the operator can telephone NMFS on a toll free line to arrange for
a change in schedule with little disruption. NMFS expects that experience in the longline fishery observer program
will provide feedback from vessel owners and operators that should result in an effective program with minimal disruption
of vessel operations and scheduling. If necessary, changes can be made to operational procedures without requiring
changes in the regulations. Finally, one of the two commenters pointed out correctly that the preamble to the proposed
rule could be clarified to indicate that: (a) The Council had recommended, and the Secretary had taken, emergency
action to close the protected species zone to longline fishing before the Biological Opinion was issued; and (b) the
limited success of the voluntary observer program had been due in large part to the limited number of observers available
for duty.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries NOAA, (AA), has determined that the measures in this rule are consistent
with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of E.O. 12866, this rule has been determined to be ``not significant''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. Permit holders
or their designated agents will have to notify NMFS at least 72 hours prior to departure on a fishing trip so the RD can
determine whether an observer must be taken. If the RD concludes an observer must be taken, the permit holder or designated
agent will be so advised and further arrangements will be made, as necessary, concerning details of time and place
of embarkation, observer duties, permit holder, vessel operator and crew responsibilities, and related matters.
Vessel owners may submit reimbursement claims for certain observer-related costs. The public reporting burden
for this collection is estimated to average 5 minutes per call, with all trips covered. About 10 percent of all calls
would result in an observer placement, requiring possibly 1 hour to meet with NMFS officials and make observer placement
arrangements. This collection is part of a previously approved collection (Southwest Region Logbook Family of Forms,
OMB No. 0648&hyph;0214), modification of which was approved by the Office of Management and Budget for the interim
final rule. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or on any other aspect of this collection-of-information
to the RD (see

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is intended to carry out the requirements of the Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement issued
by NMFS under section 7 of the ESA on June 10, 1993. These data are necessary to determine the impacts of take on the species
and possible measures to reduce or prevent the take in the future. Therefore, this rule is consistent with the ESA.

SUMMARY:

 This final rule amends the EPA Acquisition Regulation (EPAAR) coverage on organizational conflicts of interest
for all EPA contracts. In addition, it adds EPAAR coverage on conflicts of interest related to contractor personnel
working under EPA Superfund contracts and conflicts of interest related to contractors' future work which may jeopardize
Superfund work. Under this rule, contracts funded through EPA's Superfund program will contain clauses: requiring
contractor employees working on EPA Superfund contracts to sign confidentiality agreements; requiring a contractor
to notify the Agency immediately of any conflicts of interest regarding contractor personnel working on the EPA contract;
and restricting a contractor's future contracts, outside of those with EPA, when such contracts may conflict with
the work performed for EPA. These changes are necessary to avoid actual or potential conflicts of interest in work
performed under EPA Superfund contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) section 9.501 defines an organizational conflict of interest as existing
when ``because of other activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable or potentially unable
to render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's objectivity in performing the contract
work is or might be otherwise impaired, or a person has an unfair competitive advantage.'' Under EPA's Superfund program,
contractors are often asked to assist the Agency in designing remedial actions to clean up hazardous waste sites,
in identifying potentially responsible parties (PRPs) at hazardous waste sites and in implementing actions to effect
the cleanup. After identification of PRPs for specific sites, the Agency will attempt to secure private party conducted
response action or to expend Superfund Trust Funds to conduct response action and to recover costs expended for cleanup
either through consent agreements or litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Superfund program it is essential that contractors not enter into outside contracts or use personnel which
might result in an actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition, since litigation may continue for several
years after a contractor has completed work and the contractor may be asked to testify on the work performed for EPA,
it is essential that actual or potential conflicts of interest be avoided even after the contract work has been completed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to organizational conflicts of interest, EPA must ensure that contractor personnel assigned to work
on EPA contracts are free from personal conflicts of interest that might impair their ability to perform the required
work in an impartial manner. EPAAR clauses have been developed which will require EPA's Superfund contractors to
ensure that actual or potential personal conflicts of interest regarding contractor personnel are identified and
reported to the EPA Contracting Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These clauses shall be incorporated into new solicitations and new contracts. Clauses for contracts existing as
of the effective date of this rule shall be negotiated by the EPA Contracting Officer, on a case-by-case basis, and
shall be substantially similar to the clauses required by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has developed a Long Term Contracting Strategy to more effectively manage the Superfund program over the
next ten years. The clauses in this rule reflect the changing nature of the Superfund program. Although we intend to
implement the Strategy with minimal program disruption, there may be some changes to the form of some existing Superfund
contracts. Therefore, we anticipate the clauses in this rule may require updating to reflect ongoing changes to the
Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was published as a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 26, 1990, at 55 FR 17724. Twenty-two public comments were received. We express our appreciation to all the
interested organizations for the time they took in studying the proposed rule and preparing comments. As a result
of these comments, we have made a number of revisions to the rule. In seriously considering all of the comments, we implemented
recommendations that would improve the quality of the rule and minimize the burden to the contractor community, yet
ensure that EPA's programs are adequately protected. Part B of the preamble summarizes the general issues raised
and provides EPA's response and Part C of the preamble addresses section-specific comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the numbering in EPAAR subpart 1509.5 is being amended to conform with numbering changes to FAR subpart
9.5. These changes are made solely to conform to the FAR numbering scheme and do not otherwise affect the existing EPAAR.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters expressed support for an EPA rule on conflict of interest although some recommended that EPA withdraw
the proposed rule. We welcome public support and are committed to implementing a conflict of interest rule that protects
the integrity of the Superfund and other EPA programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters expressed concern that the January 1990, memorandum from the Director of the EPA's Procurement and
Contracts Management Division, which conveyed general guidance on conflict of interest to Superfund contract staff
and Superfund contractors, was not published with the proposed rule and formally open for public comments. Some also
expressed concern with issues it raised and requested that it be rescinded. Others mentioned that they were pleased
that the proposed rule was a considerable improvement over the January 1990, guidance. It was EPA's intent that the
proposed rule supersede the January 1990, guidance. We would like to make it clear that this final rule and its preamble
discussion supersedes the January 1990, guidance and the proposed rule.

Some commenters questioned EPA's authority to implement a conflict of interest rule and questioned the need for an
EPA rule on conflicts of interest stating that adequate safeguards exist. Others contended that there is no balance
between the benefits to be achieved compared to the cost of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. FAR subpart 1.3 provides agencies with the authority to implement supplemental acquisition regulations
to satisfy specific needs of the agency. We have developed the conflict of interest rule to address the specific requirements
of EPA's Superfund and other programs since sufficient coverage is not provided by existing regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past few years, the General Accounting Office (GAO) in conducting reviews of EPA's programs, the EPA in performing
management studies of the Superfund program, and Congressional Committees have all concluded that EPA's existing
conflict of interest procedures are inadequate to protect its programs. The GAO in its report ``Superfund Contracts:
EPA's Procedures for Preventing Conflicts of Interest Need Strengthening'' (GAO/RCED&hyph;899&hyph;57), dated
February 1989, and EPA, in the Administrator's Management Review of the Superfund Program (1989), pointed out the
special vulnerability of the Superfund program and strongly recommended that action be taken to strengthen EPA's
existing procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is responsible for leading the nation's efforts to protect and clean up the environment. This includes the development
of environmental standards, control of toxic substances and the cleanup of hazardous wastes, as well as enforcement
of applicable laws and regulations. Historically, the Agency has relied heavily upon contractors to accomplish
its mission, and much of this work is highly sensitive, particularly in the Superfund program. The Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA or Superfund) 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675,
consists of Public Law 96&hyph;510 (Dec. 11, 1980) and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. It provides
for liability, compensation, cleanup and emergency response for hazardous substances released into the environment
and the cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites. Because EPA has the dual responsibility of cleanup and enforcement
and because its contractors are often involved in both activities, and may conduct work for EPA and the private sector,
it is imperative that EPA contractors are free of conflicts so as not to jeopardize CERCLA response and enforcement/cost
recovery actions (hereinafter referred to as enforcement). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule focuses primarily on performance after contract award, unlike FAR which focuses on conflict of interest
issues related to contractor eligibility for award. Under Superfund contracts, work is performed at multiple sites
and new and constantly changing cleanup priorities make it impossible for EPA to identify, prior to contract award,
all site locations where work will be performed. In addition, it is impossible for EPA to predict, prior to contract
award, enforcement actions against PRPs at specific sites. Moreover, such cases may take years to resolve. Therefore,
EPA must address conflicts of interest during and after contract performance to effectively monitor conflicts and
safeguard Superfund enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Department of Justice and EPA attorneys, enforcing CERCLA, stress the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest
in the Superfund program. Conflicts of interest discovered after work has begun can create costly delays in cleanup
of sites when EPA must mitigate damage resulting from conflicts to safeguard cleanup work and enforcement from further
prejudice. Therefore, it is imperative that EPA contractors do not perform work for PRPs that conflicts with work
performed for the Agency. Conflicts arise because of differing interests of the EPA and PRPs. EPA's primary concern
is to assure that adequate environmental protection is provided, as opposed to the primary interests of PRPs, who
are usually motivated to keep costs minimized. Because these conflicts often arise in the context of adversarial
enforcement proceedings, such conflicts and leaks of sensitive enforcement information not only jeopardize cases
at the litigation stage, but also weaken the Government's position both in obtaining PRP commitment to clean up sites
and in cost recovery negotiations with PRPs. To date, EPA has the potential to seek over $4.5 billion in cost recovery;
the stakes are high.

EPA must preserve the integrity of the Superfund Program from conflicts of interest and cannot afford to jeopardize
the success of cost recovery actions and impede PRP cleanup of hazardous waste sites. A contractor's conflict of interest
can harm our Superfund litigation (either cost recovery litigation under section 107 of CERCLA, or litigation for
injunctive relief under section 106) in several ways: (1) By creating a conduit for confidential government information,
including potential litigation and negotiation strategies, which may be leaked to the parties with opposing interests
in the litigation, (2) by subjecting the credibility of EPA witnesses and/or the work they perform on behalf of EPA
to attack, and (3) by causing the work performed by that contractor to be redone, raising potential issues in cost recovery
litigation as to whether the cost of the extra work is recoverable. This rule requires EPA contractors to disclose
all conflicts of interest so that EPA will have the opportunity to consider the significance of the conflict and to
take appropriate measures to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has indeed faced several actual conflict situations which demonstrate the need for the Agency to strengthen its
conflict of interest procedures in order to protect the public interest: One such conflict involved a contractor
which had performed a removal action for EPA on a hazardous waste-contaminated site and which was currently doing
research work for EPA pertaining to that site. Another office of the contractor's company agreed to serve as an expert
witness in the EPA cost recovery litigation on behalf of one of the PRPs and, thus, against EPA, without knowledge or
approval of the Agency. The contractor's work in performing the removal action and research for EPA in anticipation
of cost recovery litigation conflicted directly with the contractor's serving as an expert witness on behalf of one
of the PRPs. Further, the contractor proceeded to convey confidential information to the PRP in the context of trying
to explain to the PRP why there was no conflict. Although settlement negotiations proceeded in this case, the strength
of the Agency's position was significantly weakened because the contractor was working for both parties and confidential
sensitive information had been divulged to the PRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the issues in Superfund litigation ultimately are matters of expert technical opinion for which EPA relies
on contractor personnel, e.g., support of remedy selection and findings that sites present ``imminent and substantial
endangerment'' to the public. In that role, contractors may be privy to the government's litigation and negotiation
strategies and other privileged and confidential information. The above case has taught us that contractor ``side
switching'' carries a strong potential for the passing of confidential information to defendants, even if unintentionally.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In another actual case, a contractor was performing remedial investigation/feasibility study work for both the
EPA and a major PRP on a contiguous site. Well over a quarter of a million dollars had been expended by EPA prior to the
discovery of the conflict. Work subsequently had to be stopped and all work which had been completed by the contractor
had to be either redone and/or verified for accuracy and completeness by another independent contractor. In addition
to the fiscal drain on the Superfund Program that this causes, we are also likely to be faced in cost recovery litigation
with a defense argument that such ``double expense'' is unnecessary and unrecoverable. This may also increase the
time and expense that the litigation and negotiation require, not including the potential millions of dollars at
risk during the cost recovery/enforcement action itself.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Still another conflict case in which cost recovery litigation was adversely impacted involved a subcontractor who
was performing PRP searches, negotiation support, and oversight of PRP work on a site for the EPA. The subcontractor
not only had a significant financial relationship with the PRPs of that site, but was also representing and performing
related work for the PRPs on the same site. The repercussions of this conflict involved not only a significant delay
in the Agency's ability to cleanup the site, but also tens of thousands of dollars in transition costs to remove and
replace the subcontractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's concerns regarding conflicts of interest are very real. As EPA continues to clean up the environment and to try
to recover the costs of the cleanup from PRPs, EPA seeks, through this rule, to protect the public from delays and increased
costs. For example, EPA contractors may perform remedial design work for EPA by developing plans and specifications
for a selected cleanup remedy at a site. If that contractor also works for a PRP to assess the contamination at the same
site, EPA, PRPs, and the public may question the integrity and objectivity of the work the contractor has performed
for EPA. Moreover, EPA could face difficulty in utilizing the contractor's expertise and experience in supporting
the merits of EPA's enforcement case. Judges and juries may doubt the credibility of a factual or expert witness who
has performed conflicting work and may have inconsistent opinions. Another example of how EPA's enforcement could
be jeopardized in the future would be if a contractor who performs technical enforcement support for EPA, including
searches for and case histories of PRPs, subsequently or concurrently worked for the PRP on the same case. Again, contractors
performing this and other types of Superfund work are often privy to sensitive EPA litigation information and case
management plans and could divulge such information to the PRP. If such information was leaked or otherwise divulged
intentionally or unintentionally, the Government's case may be damaged by disclosure to the PRP of litigation strategy.
In addition, if documents deemed confidential and privileged were released, such documents could then be admitted
into evidence in opposition to the Government's case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with commenters that the Agency has not considered the balance between the cost of the rule and the benefits
to EPA of avoiding conflicts. We believe there must be uniform regulatory requirements to raise contractors' awareness
and understanding of conflict of interest problems and the procedures needed to prevent them. Over the past few years,
the development of this rule with its strong conflict of interest provisions has created a heightened sensitivity
to conflict of interest matters throughout EPA's programs and the contractor community. As a result, we are already
seeing an increase in contractors reporting of potential conflicts to the Agency. Certainly, with the tremendous
cost of cleaning up the environment, we need to ensure the integrity of our procurement program and cannot afford to
jeopardize our enforcement actions and impede PRP cleanup of hazardous waste sites. EPA has seriously considered
the cost of the rule and has worked to minimize the rule's burden to the contractor community, yet ensure adequate protection
of its programs.

4. Pending FAR Regulations and Consistency With OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters expressed concern with the publication of EPA's rule prior to the publication of the pending FAR regulations,
and some expressed concern that the proposed rule is inconsistent with and goes beyond the existing regulations and
OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1. On October 22, 1990, the interim regulations were published as FAC 90&hyph;1, amending
the FAR subpart 9.5 on conflicts of interest. On October 25, 1991, the interim rule was converted to a final rule. We
have carefully reviewed our rule to ensure its harmony with FAR subpart 9.5. The rule specifically addresses the unique
requirements of the Superfund program which are not covered by other regulations. To safeguard our enforcement actions
and ensure the integrity of our cleanup program, it is essential that we monitor not only conflicts of interest prior
to award, but also conflicts during and after performance. These special provisions are not inconsistent with FAR
subpart 9.5.

5. Definition of Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments concerned the definition of types of conflicts of interest. The term ``conflict of interest''
in this rule has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same definition as contained in FAR Subpart 9.5. EPA has not adopted any unique or agency specific definitions for
types of conflicts of interest. EPA also has included the term ``personal conflicts of interest'' which is not defined
in the FAR. For clarity, we have provided a definition of personal conflict of interest in EPAAR Clause 1552.209&hyph;73,
Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel. A personal conflict of interest is ``a relationship
of an employee, subcontractor employee, or consultant with an entity that may impair the objectivity of the employee,
subcontractor employee, or consultant in performing the contract work.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Apparent Conflict of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters objected to the expansion of conflict of interest to include the term ``apparent'' and indicated
that the term was too vague and was not defined in the rule. To be consistent with FAR Subpart 9.5, this term has been removed
from the rule. Nevertheless, EPA strongly supports the OFPP approach on this issue and will fully comply with section
6(d) of OFPP Policy Letter 89&hyph;1, which mandates, ``Federal procurement officials shall encourage contractors
to consider carefully the potential for conflicts of interest in all of their activities associated with federal
procurement, and shall be sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest in any contracting actions.'' A comment
was also received which stressed that contractors that work for both private and public parties should avoid and mitigate
both actual conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts in order to protect the public interest. Accordingly,
our contractors should be sensitive to the appearance of conflicts of interest in all contract actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Potential and Actual Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters took exception to EPA's inclusion of the term ``potential'' to describe a particular type of conflict
as being too vague and overly restrictive, and one commenter stated that the term ``actual conflict'' was undefined
and contrary to the FAR. We disagree and are retaining the terms in the rule. The concept of potential conflicts is well
established in acquisition regulations. FAR Subpart 9.5 provides examples of situations involving potential conflicts
of interest and also includes the term ``actual'' conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Significant Conflict of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters recommended that EPA only be concerned with the reporting of significant conflicts of interest.
We disagree. It is unacceptable for contractors to report only conflicts which they consider significant. All actual
and potential conflicts of interest that are identified must be reported to the appropriate EPA Contracting Officer.
In accordance with the process set out in FAR Section 9.504, the EPA Contracting Officer identifies and evaluates
conflicts, makes a determination of whether a conflict is significant and determines if the conflict can be avoided,
mitigated, or neutralized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Restriction of Contracting Officer's Decision Making Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments received expressed concern that the rule will infringe upon or eliminate the Contracting Officer's
decision making authority on conflicts of interest. In particular, the comments stressed that it is important that
Contracting Officers make decisions on a case-by-case basis and that EPA is abrogating its responsibilities by placing
the full burden on contractors to disclose conflicts of interest no matter how insignificant or immaterial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this rule restricts the Contracting Officer from making decisions on conflicts of interest on a case-by-case
basis. In fact, Contracting Officers are required to make decisions on a case-by-case basis in accordance with FAR
subpart 9.5. The existing EPAAR requires contractor disclosure of conflicts and the rule does not change this responsibility.
This disclosure requirement does not mean that the Contracting Officer will find that every reported conflict is
significant or that it cannot be avoided, neutralized, or effectively mitigated, but rather allows the Contracting
Officer the opportunity to carefully evaluate the facts of each case and make an informed determination that protects
our programs and the public interest. Clearly, both EPA and its contractors have a continuing responsibility to identify
and prevent conflicts of interest in federal procurement. However, it is not feasible or practicable for EPA to routinely
search and review contractors' business records to unearth conflicts. Such action would be inappropriate and intrusive.
Therefore, as a practical matter, we must require contractors to report conflicts.

10. Limitation of Disclosure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that EPA revise the rule to address disclosure of client information regarding the same
subject matter as the instant solicitation, or directly relating to such subject matter as the instant solicitation.
The commenter recommended either limiting disclosure to information connected to the solicitation or to work performed
in the same state or region where the work for EPA will be performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requires disclosure of conflict of interest information related to the work performed or that will be performed
for EPA. We do not require the submission of unrelated client or other information. All that is required is sufficient
information for the EPA Contracting Officer to make an informed conflict of interest determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Disclosure of Client Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment raised the concern that contractors may be unable to divulge work performed for clients and the dollar
value, since this information as well as client lists are routinely claimed to be confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not require the release of client lists or the reporting of the dollar value of work performed for clients.
Rather, we require that a contractor disclose sufficient information to the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting
Officer can make an informed decision. In most cases, this would involve the name of a client creating the potential
conflict or the contractor, particularly if the client is a PRP on the site, and information regarding the nature of
the work. Each case is different and there may be occasions where a client routinely claims confidentiality for the
release of its name and other information concerning the conflict. If a disclosure waiver cannot be obtained from
the client, the contractor should explore with the Contracting Officer suitable alternatives for providing information
sufficient to permit the Contracting Officer to render an informed decision on the conflict. We urge contractors
to identify confidential business information and stress that EPA is committed to protecting sensitive business
and other information to the full extent permitted by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Availability of PRP Listings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed the concern that contractors can not identify all conflicts of interest unless EPA informs
contractors of all of the PRPs and of the possibility of future enforcement actions. They further stated that contractors
are unable to sign the certifications accurately unless they know these facts. Several commenters also suggested
that to avoid delays in contractor disclosure and certifications, EPA should furnish up-to-date listings of PRPs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA acknowledges the fact that PRPs are continually being identified and that contractors will not always have sufficient
knowledge of all PRPs at the time certification is submitted. We require contractors to certify to the best of their
knowledge and belief at the time of the certification. It is not EPA's intention to hold a contractor accountable for
information which the contractor did not know or have reason to know at the time the certification was executed. We
wish to stress, however, that disclosure of conflicts is a continuing obligation, and certification is a statement
that should demonstrate a contractor has made a good faith effort to disclose all potential conflicts of interest.
In order to alleviate contractors' concerns, the time period for the submission of the work assignment certification
has been extended to permit a more reasonable time period for contractors to contact EPA and obtain the most current
information concerning PRPs and future enforcement actions pertaining to sites identified in the work assignments
or contract. The term ``work assignment'' in this rule includes other similar tasking documents such as a delivery
order or a technical direction document. EPA is committed to providing contractors with the list of known PRPs for
sites at the time of work assignment issuance. EPA is currently working to make available to all Contracting Officers
the Superfund Enforcement Tracking System (SETS) report, which tracks PRPs by site. This report is available to the
public through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia.

13. Period of Record for Conflict of Interest Checks
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested clarification of the period to be searched for organizational and personal conflicts of
interest. The commenter suggested that the organizational check include all prior work performed by the contractor
but that the personal conflict of interest check be limited to the period of time that the individual is employed by
the company or for a one year period, whichever is greater.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with FAR 9.5, EPA will require all contractors who have at least three years of records to search back
through the immediately preceding three years of records. For contractors who do not have three years of records to
search, a transition period for searches will be implemented requiring the contractor to search any records that
it has until, over time, three years of records are accumulated. Contractors, however, are always required to report
any conflicts of which they are aware. We emphasize that a contractor is not required to collect, maintain or search
records on personal conflicts of interest. The requirement on the contractor is to inform its employees, performing
work under or related to EPA contracts, of their obligation to report conflicts of interest. It is the employees' responsibility
to review their current and past activities and to report potential conflicts of interest to their employers.

14. Elimination of Conflicts by Full Disclosure of Contractor Roles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that EPA should focus on full disclosure of roles, since where full and open disclosure of a contractor's
role exists no conflict of interest can occur. We disagree. Although we certainly believe in openness regarding the
role of contractors in EPA's procurement program, we fail to see how full disclosure of the role of contractors eliminates
the existence of conflicts. Rather, it is contractor disclosure of potential conflicts to EPA that provides the opportunity
to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many comments were received recommending the establishment of a centralized decision making function with an administrative
contracting officer at EPA headquarters having the responsibility for decisions on all conflict of interest requests.
It was pointed out that this would achieve consistency in conflict of interest determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have seriously considered this as an option and have rejected it. A central administrative contracting officer
would not have the necessary background or knowledge of the individual contracts to make well informed conflict of
interest determinations. We believe that a decentralized approach to conflict of interest decision making, where
determinations are made by the EPA Contracting Officer for the contract on a case-by-case basis, is the more effective
approach.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested that meaningful objective standards be adopted to evaluate significant personal and organizational
conflicts of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAR subpart 9.5 provides definitions and general rules pertaining to conflict of interest, but do not include objective
standards. Conflict of interest is a subject for which objective standards are difficult to formulate. However,
this does not mean that conflicts cannot be described through definitions and general rules. In addition to the examples
included in the FAR, EPA Contracting Officers receive training and assistance on conflict of interest issues from
the conflict of interest staff within EPA's Office of Acquisition Management. Therefore, Contracting Officers
will have available examples and precedents to assist them in their conflict of interest determinations.

One commenter expressed concern that EPA would not have the resources to efficiently administer the rule, and other
commenters recommended that EPA provide examples of conflicts of interest to help Contracting Officers respond
consistently and wisely and prevent delays associated with these new regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe the Agency has sufficient staff to administer these regulations. In the past, response times were sometimes
delayed not because of a lack of resources but because of insufficient training and experience. EPA is committed to
a comprehensive conflict of interest training program for its Contracting Officers and project personnel. The training
will include a collection of case studies and examples upon which to base conflict of interest decisions.

Another commenter, expressing support for the rule, suggested that the EPA should consider and clarify how the provisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule applies only to contracts awarded by EPA. EPA can encourage the use of similar provisions in contracts for
Superfund work awarded by other agencies or States. However, it cannot require agencies or States to include similar
provisions in those contracts. EPA is currently exploring the possibility of including its clauses in agreements
that pertain to Superfund work in contracts awarded by other agencies or States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters suggested that the rule apply to EPA contracts only and have no bearing on work performed for other
Federal agencies. It was pointed out that the rule lacks a discussion of how the restrictions in this rule bear on the
ability of contractors to seek similar work from other Federal agencies and the States. Particular concern was raised
that EPA not restrict its contractors from working simultaneously for other agencies such as the Department of Energy
(DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD) since this would be contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is committed to working closely with other agencies and States to ensure the effective and expedited cleanup
of hazardous waste sites throughout the country and encourages the use of the best cleanup technology available.
It is not our intention to restrict EPA contractors from working for the public sector. We strongly encourage contractors
to perform work for other Federal agencies and States when such work does not create a conflict of interest problem
which would impair the contractor's objectivity in performing work for EPA or damage the integrity of the EPA's cleanup
and enforcement actions. We have intentionally made no distinction between the public and private sector in the rule's
reporting requirements. To safeguard our programs, we must require that all actual or potential conflicts of interest
be identified, avoided, mitigated, or neutralized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has the responsibility to ensure compliance by Federal and State agencies with the requirements of CERCLA
and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. Because of EPA's enforcement responsibility, the interests of
EPA and other public organizations will not always be parallel and may at times be distinctly at odds. For example,
the interests of the EPA and DOD or DOE may be very different regarding the terms of Federal Facility cleanup agreements.
Therefore, it is important that our contractors are not placed in conflict situations. When an actual or potential
conflict of interest exists with work that a contractor may wish to perform with another organization, whether public
or private, the contractor shall report it to its EPA Contracting Officer so that an informed determination can be
made based on a careful review of the facts, the legal and program considerations, and the best interest of the United
States.

20. Qualified Contractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that EPA may not attract the most qualified contractors or best expertise as a result of implementing
the conflict of interest regulations. We disagree. EPA promotes full and open competition and attracts the most highly
qualified contractors to its procurement program. Securing qualified contractors and eliminating conflicts of
interest are not opposing goals. In fact, most of the highly qualified firms which compete for EPA contracts have systems
established within their organizations to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest.

21. Flow Down of the Clause to Subcontractors and Consultants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters stated that the categories of subcontractors and consultants exempted from the flow down of
the conflict of interest clauses are too limited. They specifically questioned why the ``non-discretionary technical
or engineering services, including treatability studies,'' exempted in the proposed clause, EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;74,
Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC), are not included in the flow down exemptions of all of the rule's conflict
of interest clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this rule, we carefully evaluated the types of work performed by subcontractors and consultants under
EPA's contracts, and identified certain classes of work that pose a minimal risk of conflict of interest. They include
well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, and electrical services. We
exempted these classes from the flow down provisions of all of the rule's EPAAR conflict of interest clauses. In addition,
for the LOFC clause only, we also exempted subcontractors and consultants who perform ``non-discretionary technical
and engineering services, including treatability studies.'' Although we believe that non-discretionary technical
and engineering services could pose some risk to the Agency, particularly since this category is so broad, we were
able to exempt this work from the LOFC clause because sufficient protection was provided through coverage by the basic
conflict of interest clauses, (EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;71 Organizational Conflicts of Interest, EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;73
Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel, and EPAAR 1552.227&hyph;76 Project Employee Confidentiality
Agreement.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of ``treatability studies'', we recognize that this type of work may have a high risk of conflict of interest,
yet we believe it is in the public interest to promote innovative technology and exempt such subcontract work from
any limitations on future contracting. However, because there may be a high risk of conflict for this type of work,
it is essential that protection is provided by flow down of the basic conflict of interest clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Expansion of the Class of Exemptions for Subcontractor Flow Down 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested that we broaden the classes of work to be exempt from the flow down requirements which
apply to subcontractors and consultants in all of the conflict of interest clauses. Some provided specific suggestions
of additional categories to be exempted including: Laboratory services, industrial hygiene, selected geotechnical
consulting, medical surveillance, transportation services, and graphics printing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have given serious consideration to the commenters' recommendations and believe that categorically exempting
these types of work from flow down would pose an unacceptable risk of conflict of interest to the Agency. For example,
if a laboratory services subcontractor were also providing environmental consulting services for a specific site
in support of a PRP's legal position, it would be a conflict of interest for the same subcontractor to then take or analyze
samples for the EPA from the same site. In addition, if a transportation subcontractor has a relationship with a disposal
facility that is a PRP on a site, it would be a conflict of interest for that same transportation subcontractor to also
perform work at or relating to the site for EPA, or involving the disposal facility. Each of the other recommended categories
also poses such risks, and the Agency cannot categorically exempt them. However, we recognize there may be special
cases in which these type of activities can be excluded and each clause allows for Contracting Officers to authorize
such exemptions. Thus, we have added a provision permitting a contractor to request in writing that the Contracting
Officer exempt from the flow-down requirements of the Limitation of Future Contracting clauses a particular subcontract
or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services not specifically exempted in the
clauses, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and evaluate each request on a case-by-case
basis, before approving or disapproving the request.

23. Costs Associated With Flow Down of Clauses to Subcontractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern about the costs associated with the flow down requirements of the rule's clauses. One
commenter asked if EPA is willing to pay for the costs associated with the LOFC flow down provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The allowable and allocable costs associated with this rule may be chargeable to EPA contracts in accordance with
the provisions of FAR part 31. This would also apply to allowable and allocable costs associated with this rule, which
are incurred by non-exempt subcontractors or consultants, except that such costs would be submitted to EPA's prime
contractor rather than to EPA. We anticipate that costs associated with future contracting requests under an LOFC
clause will be minimal and would be performed as a part of the normal bid and proposal effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
24. Expansion of Subcontractor Flow Down Exemption To Apply To Prime Contractors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters also requested that prime contractors be exempt from the LOFC or other conflict of interest clauses
when work to be performed under the prime contract is one of the exemptions identified in the flow down section of the
clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. EPA prime contracts include a wide variety of tasks, many of which pose a high risk for conflict of interest.
However, in the unlikely event that an EPA prime contractor only performed the type of work exempted in a specific subcontractor
flow down provision, the contractor could request from the Contracting Officer an exemption from inclusion of that
conflict of interest clause.

25. Small and Minority Business Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raised concern that the rule conflicts with the EPA Administrator's initiative to provide more work
to small and minority owned businesses and with Congressional intent to promote contracting with small business.
The commenters asserted that small firms cannot absorb the high costs of maintaining complex conflict of interest
systems. Other commenters expressed concern that the LOFC clause will hurt small businesses that need local markets
because small businesses do not have the operational breadth that larger firms possess to avoid regions where conflicts
may exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is essential that we avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts of interest in all EPA contracting. However, we recognize
the importance of small and minority owned businesses and strongly support their active participation in our procurement
programs. We are currently implementing a Long Term Contracting Strategy for the Superfund program that will enhance
the competitive environment and provide greater opportunities for small business participation by creating smaller,
regionally based contracts and subcontracting opportunities under these contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small businesses currently participate in the Superfund and other EPA programs primarily as subcontractors. As
detailed in our discussion of flow down exemptions, a number of categories of subcontracts are specifically exempt
from the requirements of the entire rule and ``non-discretionary technical and engineering services'' subcontract
work is exempt from all LOFC clause provisions. This substantially minimizes cost and associated burdens for many
small businesses participating in our programs at both the local and national level. Moreover, at any time, a small
business operating as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor may request waiver of clause requirements for
nondiscretionary work which poses a minimal risk of conflict of interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not require any special type of system to identify and report conflicts. Each contractor determines its own
procedures for searching and identifying conflicts of interest, and in some cases, it may already have a process in
place to identify conflicts in its commercial business. We anticipate that the scope of a company's procedures would
be commensurate with the company's size and complexity, and for small businesses any system would be less complex
and detailed.

26. Applicability of Rule to Related Organizations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received concerning the applicability of the rule to affiliates and other related organizations.
A few commenters encouraged EPA to publish a uniform policy regarding the disclosure burden of contractors for work
performed by parent and affiliate corporations as well as partnerships and other businesses. Most commenters opposed
the burden of extending disclosure to conflicts of interest associated with related organizations, and stressed
that it may be difficult to obtain information from affiliates regardless of common ownership. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues regarding applicability of the rule to related organizations are complex. The rule does not specifically
address related organizations, and it is not our intent to extend search and certification requirements to related
organizations and create unnecessary reporting burdens. However, we do require our contractors to make a good faith
effort to report conflicts as they are identified. If an EPA contractor is aware of a potential conflict or has reason
to believe a related organization may create a conflict of interest for the contractor, checking with that organization
to verify whether a conflict exists would certainly be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a contractor reports a conflict of interest involving a related organization and includes information which is
designated as sensitive or proprietary, the EPA will protect such information from unauthorized disclosure. An
opportunity to so mark such information shall be afforded to the submitter of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
27. Application of the Rule to Other Units of a contractor's Organization Which Do Not Perform Environmental Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted to know the extent to which the rule applies to other units of a contractor's organization which
do not perform environmental work. The commenter further stated that it is unfair to restrict service areas of a firm
that are unrelated to environmental consulting work or to the contractor unit working on an EPA contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule applies to the corporation or other legal entity that has entered into a contract with EPA, and makes no distinction
between separate divisions or units of the EPA contractor's organization. The fact that a part of the organization
does not perform environmental work does not necessarily mean it would not have a conflict of interest. EPA only restricts
its contractors from work which poses a significant conflict of interest to the Agency. We require our contractors
to identify all potential conflicts of interest and notify the EPA prior to entering into a contract for types of work
identified in the LOFC clause as posing a significant risk of conflict. This provides the EPA an opportunity to evaluate
such work and prevent conflicts that may jeopardize work performed for EPA or ongoing enforcement actions.

28. Establishment of New Organizational Units To Avoid Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comment was received that expressed concern about a contractor establishing new ``units'' with the purpose of allowing
the contractor to perform in different program areas where it might otherwise be precluded due to a conflict of interest.
The comment included a suggestion that there should be a deterrent to allowing this type of loophole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requires that contractors report to the EPA Contracting Officer all potential conflicts of interest with work
performed for EPA. While there may be instances where an organizational conflict of interest may be mitigated effectively,
all such potential conflict situations must be reported to the EPA so that the Contracting Officer can make an informed
determination based on a careful evaluation of the facts and program and enforcement concerns.

29. Contractor Authority To Decline EPA Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that an EPA contractor should be allowed to decline specific work assignments because of a conflict
with other work that the contractor may have accepted after the EPA contract was awarded. We disagree. The contractor
does not have the discretion to reject a work assignment. The contractor must report all conflicts of interest to the
EPA Contracting Officer who evaluates conflicts, makes a determination of whether a conflict is significant and
determines if the conflict can be avoided, mitigated, or neutralized. Under the terms of an EPA contract, a contractor
is required to accept and perform work issued under work assignments. Where there is an overriding public interest
to perform the work when a conflict of interest exists, the Contracting Officer may decide that the work should be performed
despite the inability to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict. For example, if an emergency situation exists
and immediate action is needed to stabilize a site to prevent injury to nearby residents, the Contracting Officer
may determine that performance on the work assignment is necessary regardless of the contractor's inability to avoid,
mitigate, or neutralize a conflict at the site.

30. Contractor's Right To Stop Work
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that a contractor should have the right to stop performance if it reasonably believes that there
would not be a significant impact upon the Agency as a result of the work stoppage. We disagree. The contract requires
performance, and work may be stopped only by the Contracting Officer. The Government's right to control costs incurred
as a result of stopping work must be protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
31. Time Limit for Responding to Conflict of Interest Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated there should be a time limit, such as three or ten days, established for Contracting Officers
to respond to any conflict of interest notification or LOFC request. Commenters further suggested that contractors
should be able to assume that approval, if required, has been given if a response has not been received from EPA within
ten days. The commenters stated that contractors may not only be placed in a position which may cause them to lose business
due to slow responses by EPA, but also may be subject to bid bond forfeitures or other penalties for failure to accept
a contract if time limits are not included in the rule. Also, for Federal contracts, contractors may risk having their
bids found non-responsive if the bid is conditioned upon EPA granting approval to enter into the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since each conflict of interest situation is unique and has varying degrees of complexity and because contractors
often do not initially provide sufficient information for a Contracting Officer to make a timely decision, the establishment
of an arbitrary time limit is not appropriate. We do not agree with the suggestion that failure to respond within ten
days should automatically be interpreted as approval. Arbitrary time limits can result in procedural questions
over submission and receipt dates and create delays. Although set response times are not included in the rule, EPA
is committed to providing timely responses. We have clarified our LOFC clauses to indicate that contractors may seek
an expedited response regarding their initial LOFC requests by submitting their requests to the Contracting Officer
and the next level within the Contracting Officer's organization.

32. Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments recommended that EPA institute an appeal process for contractors that want a review of an adverse
conflict of interest decision made by a Contracting Officer. The decision on any conflict of interest determination
is the responsibility of the EPA Contracting Officer. We have clarified the review process available for LOFC requests
if a contractor disagrees with the decision of a Contracting Officer. The contractor may file a request with the Contracting
Officer for reconsideration or the contractor may request that a Contracting Officer determination be reviewed
at a higher administrative level. Filing a request for reconsideration however, does not preclude a contractor from
seeking review at the next administrative level. The LOFC clause has been modified to include the review process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received which took exception to a unilateral placement of conflict of interest clauses into existing
contracts. EPA does not intend to unilaterally place the new EPAAR clauses into existing contracts. Clauses substantially
similar to these clauses shall be negotiated by the Contracting Officer for existing contracts, on a case-by-case
basis, as stated in the general prescription to the clauses. The general prescription to the clauses, cited in the
proposed rule as paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses, is redesignated,
under the final rule, as EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering changes to FAR
Subpart 9.5.

34. General Comments Concerning Improper Restriction of Competition and Its Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters expressed concern about a restriction of competition on Superfund work resulting from this rule. Commenters
also stated that EPA has improperly restricted competition by placing overly broad future contracting limitations
affecting sites, types of contracts, and parties with whom the contractor may contract. Commenters questioned the
authority to impose ``post contract'' restrictions and stated that such activity should be governed by internal
guidelines and market forces. Others stated that these clauses prevent EPA from having access to the most qualified
sources in its contracting program. Other comments reflected an interpretation that the restrictions apply to affiliates
and to contractor clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with these comments. The LOFC clause and its alternates are not overly broad nor do they improperly restrict
competition. The LOFC clause and each alternate are focused narrowly upon areas which have a high potential for conflict.
The authority for ``post contract'' restriction is recognized in FAR Section 9.507. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many EPA Superfund solicitations and contracts currently include clauses similar to those contained in this rule.
EPA has attracted qualified contractors and competition has not diminished. The comment concerning the limitation
of competition based upon the flow down of restrictions to affiliates or to clients reflects an assumption based upon
a misreading of the proposed rule. There is no flow down of restrictions to affiliates or to clients.

35. Negotiation of Specific LOFC Clauses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment suggested that the LOFC clause be negotiated separately for each contract. This will occur for existing
contracts. However, the rule's EPAAR clauses are required for all solicitations and new contracts. The Contracting
Officer may, however, consider a deviation to the inclusion or for the modification of the clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
36. Assessment of the Cost and Economic Impacts of Limiting Work on Existing Contracts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters were concerned about the limitation on business as a result of the inclusion of the LOFC clauses in existing
contracts. One commenter stated that an assessment of the economic impacts of the rule has not been performed for existing
contracts. The commenter further stated that the limitations contained in the LOFC clause, which will be included
by modification into existing contracts, will adversely affect its future activities. The commenter's concern
is that these effects were not envisioned by the contractor at the time it submitted its offer to the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule states that the EPAAR clauses are to be placed in all solicitations and new contracts unless a deviation is
obtained. For contracts existing as of the effective date of the rule, clauses substantially similar to those in the
rule are to be negotiated and incorporated into those contracts, on a case-by-case basis. EPA will not unilaterally
incorporate these new clauses into existing contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the cost and economic impacts of the rule, EPA has performed a cost burden analysis of the rule and recognizes
that there will be some economic impact as a result of implementing these clauses. During the formulation of the LOFC
clause for each existing contract, the negotiation process will assure that any specific economic attributes associated
with the contract are taken into consideration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To respond to these concerns, we have made significant reductions in the proposed rule's certification requirements.
Under the final rule, all Superfund contractors are required to submit certifications, but they are no longer required
to submit both annual and work assignment certifications. In addition, the requirement for work plan certifications
has been eliminated, and the number of work assignment certifications has been reduced. Under the final rule, a work
assignment certification is required within 20 days from the time the contractor receives a work assignment. If a
subsequent work assignment is issued to the contractor under the same contract for additional work at the same site(s)
covered by the initial work assignment, an additional certification for the new work assignment is not required.
This is not intended to relieve the contractor from reporting any future conflicts of interest relating to the site(s).
The contractor will still be expected to search and report any conflicts of interest based upon new information which
has been identified. These certification changes will significantly reduce the burden on contractors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
38. Multiple Sites Under Work Assignments, Addition of Sites to a Work Assignment and the Allocation of Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter expressed concern that since sites and PRPs may be added to the work assignments during performance,
contractors cannot certify at the work assignment acceptance phase that all conflicts have been disclosed. This
concern also applies to a multi-site work assignment where sites are identified as the work arises. The commenter
also expressed concern about the recovery of costs incurred for records retention pertaining to sites under multi-site
contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The work assignment clause requires that the contractor certify to the best of its knowledge and belief that all conflicts
of interest have been reported or that no conflicts of interest exist. We recognize that all site and PRP information
may not be available at the time of the certification, which under the final rule is 20 days after the contractor receives
the work assignment. If a site is added to the work assignment after the certification is submitted, a subsequent certification
is not required for the additional site. The certification includes a statement that the contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any conflicts arising during performance of the work assignment pertaining
to all sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowable costs associated with work performed under the contract, including records retention pertaining to sites,
shall be allocated consistent with the contractor's cost accounting system. Since work assignments are so diverse,
questions concerning the proper allocability of costs on a specific work assignment should be directed to the Contracting
Officer.

39. Cost to Contractors Associated With Requesting Approval for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future Work After Contract Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were received concerning the reimbursement of costs associated with the submission of LOFC requests,
filed after the expiration of the EPA contract. Another commenter expressed concern about costs contractors may
incur as a result of involvement in future litigation matters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LOFC clause identifies work that is high risk to the Agency. The purpose of this clause is to avoid conflicts that
jeopardize the Superfund program and EPA's enforcement efforts. After expiration of the contract or work assignment,
contractors only have to request approval for future contracting identified in the LOFC clause. Costs associated
with this approval process should be minimal and would be performed as a part of the normal bid and proposal effort.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of costs associated with future involvement in litigation matters is not within the scope of this rule. However,
generally if EPA requires expert witness or special litigation support for a Superfund case, it would enter into a
contract for such services. For costs associated with other witness testimony, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
or the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure would apply.

40. FAR Coverage of Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the FAR requires detailed paperwork only when necessary to examine ``significant potential
conflicts'' and to determine appropriate mitigation measures. We agree. In accordance with FAR section 9.505, EPA's
Contracting Officers examine each situation on the basis of its particular facts and exercise common sense, good
judgment and sound discretion in order to minimize the paperwork burden. Only information which is sufficient to
permit the Contracting Officer to identify and evaluate conflicts of interest shall be requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
41. Paperwork Requirement and EPA Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the paperwork required violates the Paperwork Reduction Act and is unnecessary to achieve
EPA's program objectives. We do not agree. EPA has not violated the Paperwork Reduction Act and has made every effort
to minimize the paperwork burden associated with this rule consistent with achieving its objectives in the area of
conflict of interest. The final rule reflects a substantial reduction in the paperwork burden to contractors participating
in EPA's procurement program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
42. Paperwork Burden Concerns
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters expressed concerns about the burden the rule would impose upon contractors. Several commenters
stated that EPA's burden estimate was too low. One commenter stated that its conflict of interest review effort required
much less time than that which was estimated by EPA. Others offered suggestions on how EPA could reduce the paperwork
burden and still accomplish its objectives. These suggestions included elimination of duplicative certifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has considered these suggestions and has made significant reductions to the paperwork burden associated with
this rule. Under the final rule, contractors will not be required to submit certifications on both an annual and a work
assignment basis. In addition, the work plan certification requirement has been eliminated from the proposed rule's
amendment to the work assignment clause. Under the final rule, a single certification will be submitted within twenty
days from the time the contractor receives the work assignment, and it will cover conflicts of interest for all effort
to be performed or related to sites under the work assignment. Furthermore, if a subsequent work assignment is issued
to the contractor under the same contract for additional work at the same site, an additional certification for the
new work assignment is not required. The initial certification is sufficient because it requires a continuing obligation
by the contractor to report any conflicts associated with the site(s). The paperwork burden associated with the LOFC
clause and its alternates has been reduced because the time frames for requesting approval commence at the conclusion
of the work assignment instead of the expiration date of the contract. In many cases, this will reduce the LOFC request
period by several years. In the final rule, EPA has also eliminated the requirement for an annual update of the conflict
of interest plan in order to reduce reporting requirements.

43. Data Base Searches and Cost Reimbursement for Paperwork Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters stated that contractor data bases do not contain the type of information that EPA is requesting and, therefore,
contractors would not be able to provide complete certifications on conflicts of interest. Other commenters expressed
concerns that the development of data bases and the other administrative costs associated with the rule will not be
recovered by the contractors and have not been included in the total cost for conflict of interest systems. They recommended

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that EPA provide a mechanism for contractors to recoup these costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not require that contractors establish any particular kind of information retrieval system. EPA recognizes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contractors often do not have all of the information readily accessible upon which to base their certifications.
Therefore, the certifications contain the statement that the contractor is certifying to the best of its knowledge
and belief as of the date of the certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the costs associated with the rule and a conflict of interest system, the rule states that costs associated
with conflicts of interest may be chargeable to Government contracts under the provisions of FAR Part 31. Following
the expiration of the contract, no certifications are required. For expired contracts, which involved efforts at
sites, the costs associated with search effort associated with the LOFC clause should be minimal. These post contract
costs would normally be allocated to the contractor's bid and proposal pool.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is a description of the final rule's EPAAR clauses and our response to comments on the specific clauses
and their prescriptions which are not addressed in the preceding general comments section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;71, Organizational Conflicts of Interest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is modified to specify that notification of actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest should be
made prior to commencement of work. However, in emergency situations, work may begin with notification being made
within five work days. The clause also identifies specific subcontracts and consultant agreements for which this
clause is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment, the following changes have been made to the proposed modification of this clause and
its prescription:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed from this clause and all other clauses in the rule in response to comments that
the term is vague and difficult to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(1) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses,
has been redesignated as paragraph (a), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause. In addition, the reference to FAR
9.508&hyph;2 has been removed from this paragraph since FAC 90&hyph;1 removed this section from the FAR. These minor
changes have been made to conform with the numbering changes to FAR subpart 9.5 based on FAC 90&hyph;1, and are in accord
with public comments urging that the final rule be consistent with any changes to the FAR.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Clarification of ``any work''. One commenter requested that the term ``any work'' in paragraph (b) of the clause
be clarified. ``Any work'' would generally refer to any billable hours to the issued work assignment. The term ``work
assignment'' in this rule includes other similar tasking documents such as a delivery order or a technical direction
document. Our intent is for contractors to report potential conflicts prior to beginning work on a contract or a work
assignment issued under a contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Immediate reporting of whether a conflict of interest exists. Some commenters objected to EPA's requiring the
immediate reporting of whether or not a conflict of interest exists and recommended that such reporting not be required
until ten days after a work assignment is issued. Some also pointed out the difficulty in responding without knowledge
of future assignments and access to reliable data on PRPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. Conflicts of interest must be identified immediately so we can avoid issuing work when a conflict exists.
We recognize that contractors may not always have sufficient information to identify all conflicts when work assignments
are issued since PRPs are continually being identified, but this should not delay a good faith disclosure of any conflicts
that can be identified prior to beginning work. Moreover, in response to comments, the final rule does not require
contractors to certify regarding conflicts of interest related to work assignments until 20 days after receipt of
the work assignment. (See EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments, Alternate I.) Additionally, it should be noted
that in emergency situations contractors may begin work immediately with notification to follow within five days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Removal of Alternate I to paragraph (e). One commenter recommended that Alternate I of paragraph (e) of the clause,
which applies to non-Superfund contracts, be removed. We disagree. Since the types of work exempted from flow down
in paragraph (e) are unlikely to be performed in non-Superfund contracts, it would be confusing to include this language
in such contracts. In the event these types of work are included in the contract, the Contracting Officer may authorize
exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;73, Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is added for Superfund contracts to ensure that contractors notify the Contracting Officer of actual or potential
personal conflicts of interest prior to incurring costs for an employee where the contractor is aware that the employee
has a personal conflict of interest. The clause also identifies specific subcontracts and consultant agreements
for which this clause is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment, the following changes have been made:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Paragraph (a) has been modified slightly to make the language clearer that the provisions with regard to employee
personnel performing under this contract shall apply until the earlier ``of the following two dates: the termination
date of the affected employee(s) or the expiration date of this contract.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Paragraph (b) has been rewritten to clarify that a contractor is responsible for reporting personal conflicts of
interest regarding its subcontractor employees and consultants when such conflicts have been reported to the contractor.
This clarification is made in response to public concern that a contractor is unlikely to have knowledge of the personal
conflicts of interest of its subcontractors' employees and should not be held responsible for identifying such personal
conflicts of interest unless they have been brought to its attention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(2) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses,
has been redesignated as paragraph (b), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering
changes to FAR Subpart 9.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription language to this clause has also been changed to be consistent with the prescription to the Organizational
Conflict of Interest Clause. The final prescription, paragraph (b), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2 Contract clause, includes
a small purchase limitation threshold.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Personal conflict of interest certification and disclosure. A number of commenters expressed concern that it
is unfair and too burdensome to require contractors to certify that all personal conflicts had been reported. They
stressed that since contractors have to rely on their employees to report such conflicts that all that should be required
is a good faith effort to obtain such information. Some requested that disclosure be limited to those personal conflicts
of which the contractor has knowledge. A concern was also raised that prime contractors should not be put in a position
to certify that there are no personal conflicts of interest regarding subcontractor employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree and have eliminated the personal conflict of interest certification that was included as part of the annual
certification and the work plan/work assignment certification in the proposed rule. Under the final rule, all that
contractors must certify, as part of either a work assignment or annual conflict of interest certification, is that
they have informed their employees, working under the requirements of the work assignment or EPA contract, of their
obligation to report organizational and personal conflicts of interest. (See EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments.
Alternate I, and EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;80, Annual Certification.) When a contractor has been informed of a personal
conflict, either by an employee or a subcontractor, or has knowledge of such a conflict, it should then report this
to the EPA Contracting Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicability of Privacy Act of 1974 and collection of records. One commenter raised concern that this clause could
have the effect of requiring contractors to develop and maintain ``systems of records [as defined in the Privacy Act
of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a)] on individuals on behalf of the agency to accomplish an agency function.'' Commenters also
stated that the systems of records needed would be excessively burdensome. Some also expressed concern about the
flow down provisions of the clause to subcontractors in terms of records and the use of this material at the prime contractor
level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not EPA's intention to require contractors or their subcontractors to keep records tracking the personal conflicts
individual employees may have, nor is it our intention that prime contractors keep personal conflict of interest
records of their subcontractors. Such records are not necessary to comply with our reporting requirements. EPA's
intent is to minimize any paperwork and administrative burden by having both prime contractors and subcontractors
make their employees aware of the sensitivity and importance of conflict of interest when working on EPA projects
and to place with their employees the responsibility for identifying conflicts. When the contractor is informed
of a personal conflict, it should then report the conflict to EPA. When a personal conflict would arise at the subcontractor
level, the subcontractor would notify the prime contractor of the conflict of interest, along with a description
of actions taken to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict. The prime contractor would in turn notify EPA. If
subcontractor information is sensitive, the prime contractor will consult with the Contracting Officer to determine
a procedure that will allow the prime contractor to fulfill the conditions of the contract and simultaneously providing
protection for the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Ownership of stock and objectivity of individuals. One commenter suggested that without criteria about ownership
of stock or the knowledge about the psychology of individuals, the concept of personal conflict of interest is impossible
to define in practice. We recognize that analysis of conflict situations may be difficult, and there are no objective
criteria that can address every situation that might arise. The critical test that a contractor must use regarding
any potential conflict is whether a conflict exists which would impair the person's objectivity in performing the
work under an EPA contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Limiting disclosure requirements to key project personnel. Some commenters stated that the proposed clause was
too broad and should apply to key personnel and not to personnel, such as clerical or accounting employees, who have
no influence over work on a project. Some commenters connected this requirement to the system of records issue previously
addressed, to demonstrate the prohibitive expense associated with the notification requirement by all personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has carefully considered exempting certain personnel working under an EPA contract from the requirements of
the clause and has decided not to change the clause which extends the notification requirements to all personnel performing
work under an EPA contract. We do not agree that employees below the level of ``key personnel'' do not contribute to
and influence work on EPA projects. One cannot assume that personnel will always perform tasks which are limited to
their generic job categories, and that such employees never have access to sensitive information and never exercise
discretion that may impact work performed for EPA. The final rule simply requires that a contractor inform its employees
about their responsibility to report conflicts of interest. This process is a significantly less burdensome approach
to managing personal conflicts of interest. The development or maintenance of a system of records about a contractor's
employees is not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding
Personnel clause. Therefore, the concern about the expense associated with a system of records is not central to the
issue of which personnel would be subject to the provisions of the clause.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Conflict of interest applied to employee level. One commenter stated that it is not clear why EPA is applying conflict
of interest rules at the individual employee level and that the regulation should clarify how the ``objectivity/bias''
rule could be compromised at this level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout this rule, we have emphasized the special nature of Superfund work and the importance of ensuring integrity
of work at sites so that the enforcement actions are not jeopardized. We believe that a contractor employee with a personal
conflict of interest that impaired his objectivity in performing work for EPA could impact Superfund work. Persons
working on our contracts must be able to render impartial assistance so that the integrity of the work product is not
questioned. For example, if a contractor employee performed work for EPA at a site on which the employee had performed
work for a PRP, and the individual was called upon to testify in court to support prior actions taken by the PRP, as well
as to testify to support actions by the EPA, the credibility of the employee's testimony may be questioned. Moreover,
a contractor employee with a conflict of interest stemming from a relationship with a PRP at a site could pose an unacceptable
risk of disclosure of sensitive information that could impact cost recovery strategy or other enforcement action
regarding the site. All we require is that personal conflicts of interest be reported so that we have the opportunity
to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts that may jeopardize our programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Relationships covered by personal conflict of interest clause. One commenter requested a definition concerning
the types of ``relationships'' that might be covered by the personal conflict of interest clause. ``Relationships''
may include personal, financial or business affiliations/connections which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would impair a person's objectivity in performing the contract work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Individual ownership of stock and mutual funds. One commenter pointed out that the term ``relationship'' in this
clause can be interpreted either narrowly or broadly, and asked how EPA views the ownership of stock in an entity or
the owning of shares in a mutual fund which owns stock in the entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since each situation is different and should be examined on a case-by-case basis, it is not appropriate to establish
a position on whether certain ownership of stock in an entity would or would not create a conflict. We would generally
view substantial ownership of stock in an entity as having a higher conflict of interest risk than the more passive
investment in a mutual fund which normally conducts transactions without the active participation of the shareholders.
However, specialized mutual funds may exist which invest in a very narrow group of stocks. Therefore, each situation
should be considered on its own merits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Notification to the Project Officer and to the Contracting Officer. One commenter stated that notification to
the EPA Project Officer and to the Contracting Officer is redundant and unnecessary and that notification to the Contracting
Officer should suffice. We have reviewed this recommendation and have decided to retain notification to the Project
Officer. Personal conflicts can have an immediate impact upon work that is performed. Notification directly to the
Project Officer will expedite the EPA response time in avoiding mitigating, or neutralizing such conflicts which
would be beneficial to both the Agency and the contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Remedies for non-disclosure. One commenter stated that the rule does not identify what remedies, if any, would
be available to the Government in the event that EPA concludes that a personal conflict of interest was not disclosed
by a contractor. The commenter further stated that appropriate action referenced in the clause could only be termination
for convenience. We disagree. Remedies may include avoidance, mitigation, and neutralization of the conflict as
well as any other remedies which would be permitted under the terms and conditions of the contract.

EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;74, Limitation of Future Contracting
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is added for Superfund contracts to ensure that contractors do not perform work that may conflict with work performed
for EPA and jeopardize Superfund enforcement actions. The clause identifies work which poses a high risk of conflict
of interest and requires contractors to request approval from EPA prior to entering into such contracts. Alternates
are provided that are tailored to specific types of Superfund contracts. The basic Limitation of Future Contracting
(LOFC) clause is for Alternative Remedial Contracting Strategy (ARCS) contracts, and alternates are for Time Critical
Rapid Response (TCRR), Technical Assistance Team (TAT), Environmental Services Assistant Team (ESAT), Technical
Enforcement Support (TES), Headquarters Support, and Site Specific contracts. Depending on the type of EPA work
performed, this limitation may extend for the period of the contract or from three to seven years after completion
of a work assignment. The clause does not prevent contractors from submitting bids/proposals for outside work prior
to receiving Contracting Officer approval. However, the clause provides that any bids/proposals are submitted
at the contractor's own risk and expense. This clause must also be placed in subcontract and consultant agreements
except for specific types of services listed in the clause unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of public comment, including recommendations that the applicability of the LOFC clause and its alternates
be clarified, the following changes have been made:

_The prescription to this clause, paragraph (c)(3) of EPAAR 1509.508, Solicitation provision and contract clauses,
has been redesignated as paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, to conform with recent numbering
changes to FAR Subpart 9.5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause has also been changed to be consistent with the prescription for the Organizational
Conflict of Interest Clause. The final prescription, paragraph (c), EPAAR 1509.507&hyph;2, Contract clause, includes
a small purchase limitation threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates except Alternative VI, two additional paragraphs have been added
to set forth procedures for an expedited response to an initial LOFC request and for review of an adverse determination.
For Alternative VI, three additional paragraphs have been added to set forth procedures for a request for waiver or
modification of the clause, for an expedited response to an initial future contracting request, and for review of
an LOFC adverse determination. This responds to recommendations that we identify a review process available for
contractors who may question an EPA Contracting Officer's decision on an LOFC request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates, all references to ``zone'' have been changed to ``assigned geographical
area.'' This adds clarity by reflecting the new terminology in the Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC Clause (ARCS) and all alternates, the type of Superfund contract covered by each clause is now added
at the top of each clause. This reduces confusion in reading the text. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I has been renamed ``Time Critical Rapid Response'' (TCRR), and we have noted in the clause prescription
that this term includes TCRR, Emergency Response Cleanup Services (ERCS) and other emergency type solicitations
and contracts. This change has been made to clarify the clause's applicability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In Alternate I (TCRR), Alternate II (TAT) and Alternate V (Headquarters Support), all references to ERCS have been
changed to TCRR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The Field Investigative Team (FIT) Alternate LOFC clause has been removed since such work is to be included in the

_All alternates to this clause have been renumbered to reflect the removal of the FIT Alternate. All further references
will be to the new numbers of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) has been changed to reflect the inclusion of FIT work in ARCS contracts. Since the proposed
rule's FIT LOFC clause is less restrictive than the basic LOFC clause (ARCS), language specifically tailored to FIT
work in ARCS contracts is added to minimize contractor burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (a) has been changed in accordance with comments recommending it be consistent
with paragraph (a) of its alternates, which include ``free to compete for contracts on an equal basis'' language.
All further references will be to the new paragraph (a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs have been relettered to reflect the change in paragraph (a) and the inclusion
of a paragraph addressing FIT work. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) are redesignated as paragraphs (b) and (c). The new
FIT paragraph is designated as paragraph (d). Paragraphs previously designated as (b), (c) and (d) have been redesignated
as paragraphs (e), (f), and (g). All further references will be to the new lettering of the final clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and all alternates, paragraph (a) language has been changed from ``It is agreed by
the parties to this contract*&blank;*&blank;*'' to ``The parties to this contract agree*&blank;*&blank;*'' This
minor change was made so the LOFC clause language conforms with the use of the active voice in other EPAAR clauses.

_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (c) and (d), parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternates I (TCRR) and II (TAT) and (d)

(1) These paragraphs have been rewritten to emphasize that all that is required is that contractors obtain approval
prior to entering into a contract with respect to the type of work identified. This gives EPA the opportunity to evaluate
such requests on a case-by-case basis and limit its contractors from performing work which would jeopardize work
performed for EPA or ongoing enforcement actions. This change was made in response to public concern that this paragraph
absolutely prohibited the nature of work described. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In further response to public comment on these paragraphs, ``other than EPA'' has been added after ``any party''
to clarify that this clause does not cover future work a contractor may enter into for EPA.

_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (c) and (d), and parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternates I (TCRR) and II (TAT) and
(d) of Alternate IV (TES) have also been modified in response to comments questioning the scope of the limitation.
We have clarified that all that is required is reporting of: ``(1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain
to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize
CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under
this contract.'' We are concerned with evaluating future contractor work related to Superfund work performed for
EPA on a site to ensure it does not jeopardize ongoing EPA Superfund work or enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (c), which contains similar language addressing Site Specific contracts,
has also been modified in response to comments questioning its scope. We have clarified that all that is required is
reporting of: ``(1) Any work relating to CERCLA activities which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously
performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain
to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for the EPA under this contract.'' We are concerned with
evaluating future contractor work related to Superfund work performed for EPA on the site covered by its contract
to ensure it does not jeopardize ongoing EPA Superfund work or enforcement action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (c) and parallel paragraphs (c) of Alternate II (TAT) and (d) of Alternate IV (TES) have
further been revised. The language ``during the life of the contract'' and ``after completion of the contract'' has
been changed to be consistent with the basic LOFC clause (ARCS), which tracks by tasking document, not by contract.
This change is made in response to commenters' recommendations. It substantially minimizes the burden to contractors
by reducing the time period for which the contractor must request approval for future work.

and ``after the completion of the delivery order or tasking document''. The new language in paragraph (c) of Alternate
II (TAT) is ``during the life of the technical direction document'' and ``after the completion of the technical direction
document''. The language in paragraph (d) of Alternate IV (TES) is now ``during the life of the work assignment'' and
``after completion of the work assignment''.

_Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (f) and identical paragraphs (f) of Alternates I (TCRR), II (TAT), IV (TES), VI
(Site Specific), (c) of Alternate III (ESAT) and (e) of Alternate V (Headquarters Support) have been modified. The
language ``agrees not to use it to compete with such companies'' is removed. This change was made to clarify that it
is not EPA's intent to restrict its contractors from using their experience gained in working on EPA contracts from
competing with other companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (d)(3), Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(3), and Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph
(d)(2) have been revised to include ``CERCLA administrative order''. This modification is made in response to public
comment that we cover contracts let prior to final issuance of a CERCLA or Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)
consent decree or court order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I (TCRR) paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) language describing TAT work is changed from ``Technical Assistance
Team activities (TAT contracts)'' to ``Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts)''.
This change clarifies that this provision applies to TAT type activities and that ``TAT contracts'' is an example
of such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (d)(1) language is also changed from ``Technical Assistance Team activities
(TAT contracts)'' to ``Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts)''. This change clarifies
that this provision applies to TAT type activities and that ``TAT contracts'' is an example of such work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In Alternate I (TCRR), paragraph (g), ``treatability studies'' has been added to the flow down exemptions to make
this Alternate clause consistent with all other LOFC clauses in the rule. In addition, because the term ``treatability
studies'' is not routinely used in TCRR contracts, we have noted in the prescription that this term includes ``TCRR
pilot scale studies.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_In Alternate IV (TES), we have retained the clause's paragraph (b) language instead of choosing the proposed rule's
option to paragraph (b). This responds to public comment that the initial paragraph (b) is more cost effective and
that implementing the other proposed option would be extremely cumbersome and expensive. In addition, we have added
``during the performance period of this contract'' at the beginning of the paragraph in response to comments requesting
we clarify the period of applicability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_In Alternate V (Headquarters Support), paragraph (c), we have added ``unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting
Officer.'' This change is made in response to public comments expressing concern that there may be circumstances
where the nature of the work under such contracts would not pose a significant conflict for the EPA, and this clause
should not categorically exempt contractors from performing work without examining requests on a case-by-case
basis. We agree that the Contracting Officer shall make conflict of interest determinations on a case-by-case basis
and this change reflects our intent. The objective of this and all of the LOFC clauses is to identify work which we believe
may pose significant risk of conflict of interest and provide EPA the opportunity to avoid conflicts that would damage
the integrity of the Superfund program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Alternate V (Headquarters Support) paragraph (c), FIT and Remedial Engineering Management (REM) contracts are
removed from the list of examples of contracts which include response action work. Although FIT and REM contracts
included response action work, it is no longer appropriate to include them as examples since these contracts are being
phased out of the Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other public comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applicability of LOFC clauses to types of work. One commenter requested that the LOFC clauses should be unambiguously
keyed to types of work since the nature of work in different contract types overlap. We disagree. The basic LOFC clause
and each alternate are identified by the Superfund program contract type, i.e., ARCS, TCRR, TAT, ESAT, TES, Headquarters
Support, and Site Specific. These are the standard terms used in the Superfund program to describe types of contracts
by nature of Superfund work. To key the LOFC clauses to other types of work would be confusing, ambiguous and difficult
to track both for contractors and the EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Different time periods for LOFC clause and alternates. Several commenters expressed concern that there was no
justification provided for the different time periods and suggested that EPA make the reporting time frames in the
LOFC clauses consistent. Additionally, commenters stated the reporting requirements should either be applicable
after completion of the work assignment or reporting should be limited to the duration of the contract. Still other
commenters suggested the reporting period should be no longer than three years after work assignment completion.
And other commenters stated the reporting requirement after contract completion was overly restrictive if it is
to be applied to any new contracting activity but would be less objectionable if site references were restricted to
only National Priorities List (NPL) sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree reporting requirements for work performed at a site should be limited to a period of time after completion
of the work assignment rather than after contract completion and have made the changes in the appropriate LOFC clauses.
Each LOFC clause has been carefully studied and specifically tailored to fit each program with appropriate time periods
based on the nature of work performed under the contract and the risk of conflict. Because each of the different programs
requiring an LOFC clause has a different role in Superfund cleanup and enforcement, it is necessary for some programs
to have different reporting requirements. The establishment of each time period was made after extensive discussion
of program and enforcement issues. Every attempt was made, however, to be as consistent as possible without jeopardizing
the Superfund program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree that reporting requirements should be limited to the duration of the contract or for only three years.
These time limits would not adequately protect the interests of the Superfund program. Because environmental enforcement
cases are averaging seven years from start to completion, it would be very damaging to EPA's enforcement cases if an
EPA contractor could at will perform related work for a PRP at or relating to the same site after it had performed work
for EPA. For example, the TES reporting requirement of seven years is necessary to avoid the potential for compromising
highly sensitive enforcement support information. To reduce this time frame would significantly jeopardize our
ability to enforce CERCLA. Therefore, to prevent such occurrences, it is absolutely necessary for EPA to have procedures
in place which require contractors to request approval before entering into future work with PRPs that could negatively
impact the work performed for EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Limit LOFC clause to NPL sites. Several commenters recommended that the LOFC clause and its alternates apply only
to NPL sites. Some expressed concern whether ``sites'' includes Federal Facilities and requested clarification.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree that the clause should be limited to NPL sites and stress that the rule makes no distinction between private
party sites and Federal Facilities. Restricting the clause's applicability to work on NPL sites would provide insufficient
protection to the Superfund program. The NPL is a priority listing of hazardous waste sites which have been identified
for possible long-term remedial cleanup action under Superfund. Most sites are not placed on the NPL until they have
been formally evaluated and meet a Hazard Ranking System threshold. Contractors perform emergency Superfund work
and pre-remedial work for EPA on many hazardous waste sites that may or may not later be placed on the NPL and also provide
support for enforcement activities at non-NPL sites. It is important to protect such work from conflicts of interest
particularly since we may initiate cost recovery action against PRPs for cleanup work at sites that are not yet on the
NPL and may never be placed on the NPL. Moreover, work an EPA contractor may wish to perform for a private party on a non-NPL
site may directly conflict with work performed for EPA and jeopardize CERCLA enforcement activities. Therefore,
the LOFC clause intentionally makes no distinction between NPL and non-NPL site work in its reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. ``Any party''. Some commenters expressed concern that the term ``any party'' used in the LOFC clause was too broad,
and stated that the term could be interpreted to include another Federal agency. We disagree that the term is too broad
and it is our intent that it include Federal agencies. The rule makes no distinction between private and public sector
work in its reporting requirements. Contractors must report work which is identified as having a high risk of conflict
whether it is for a private party or a Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. ``Jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions''. One commenter recommended that the language in paragraph (c) and
(d) of the basic LOFC clause (ARCS) and the parallel language in the Alternates be removed since it is difficult for
contractors to determine whether proposed actions will jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions. We disagree with
this recommendation. The language is included to require contractors to request approval from the EPA Contracting
Officer before entering into a contract for work which may damage our Superfund enforcement actions so that EPA has
the opportunity to protect its enforcement actions from prejudice. When a contractor believes that there is a risk
that work may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions, the contractor shall submit a request to the EPA Contracting
Officer who will make the determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Define ``CERCLA activities''. Several commenters requested that we define ``CERCLA activities'' and one commenter
specifically requested that we exempt from the definition activities under Sections 312 and 313 of the Superfund
Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of CERCLA activities is set out in Section 101 of CERCLA. ``CERCLA activities'' includes the terms ``remove
or removal'' the terms ``remedy or remedial action'' and the terms ``respond or response'' as defined in Sections
101 (23), (24) and (25). Activities under Sections 312 and 313 of SARA are by definition excluded from the term ``CERCLA
activities''. Sections 312 and 313 are reporting requirements in SARA Title III, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act of 1986'', which is not part of CERCLA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. LOFC and unrelated sites. Commenters stated that the LOFC clauses should not be broadened but should only cover
a site where a contractor previously worked for EPA. One commenter stated that EPA had no authority to deny private
contracting on an unrelated site. Another commenter stated that it would be almost impossible to administer or enforce
the abstract concept of doing CERCLA work for a private client at a given site where work had not been performed before.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first comment refers to the LOFC clause for ARCS and its alternates for TCRR, TAT, TES, and Site Specific contracts.
Each of these clauses contains restrictions pertaining to sites where the contractor previously worked for EPA and
on any work that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to a site where the contractor previously
performed work for the EPA under the contract. This limitation is required because work on related sites could adversely
affect EPA's CERCLA enforcement action at a site where the contractor previously performed work for EPA. The LOFC
alternates for TCRR, TAT and TES contain limitations for geographic areas. These limitations apply only during the
period of performance of the contract. They are included in the TCRR and TAT clauses because these two types of work
cannot be performed by the same contractor in the same geographic area because the risk of a conflict occurring is too
great. In the TES contracts, the geographic limitation on remedial and implementation work is necessary because
of the risk associated with extremely sensitive litigation information, the unauthorized disclosure of which would
jeopardize EPA's enforcement actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second commenter uses the term ``unrelated sites'' in the comment concerning restrictions on private contracting.
We are unclear as to the commenter's definition of this term. EPA's LOFC clause and alternates limit CERCLA work which
pertains to a site, or limit work that may jeopardize enforcement actions which pertain to a site, where the contractor
previously performed work for EPA under the contract. The only other site limitations are those in the TCRR, TAT and
TES Alternates which pertain to sites within the geographic area of the contract. There are no restrictions to sites
outside these limitations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the commenter that stated that it would be difficult to administer or enforce the limitations that pertain
to the performance of CERCLA work or work which jeopardizes enforcement actions at sites where a contractor has not
performed previous work for EPA. However, EPA's intent in the LOFC clause is not to require excessive administration
but rather to have contractors rely on information of which they are aware at the time they consider entering into a
contract for work at other sites. No extensive searches, certifications, or control systems associated with administration
are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraphs (a) and (b)_Contractors right to compete. One commenter suggested that the
clause include the same ``free to compete on an equal basis'' language in the alternate LOFC clauses. The commenter
further stated that the clauses require clarification that, when a contractor has prepared the statement of work
or other solicitation package for a private party, the restriction of the clause does not apply. Another commenter
requested that the clause be expanded to provide that any contractor that contributes to the development of the statement
of work or the solicitation package should be ineligible to participate in follow-on Superfund remedial action projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree with the recommendation that the clause be changed to be consistent with its alternates, which include ``free
to compete on an equal basis'' language, and have made this change in the final clause language. We also agree with the
commenter's conclusion that the restriction when a contractor has prepared a statement of work or solicitation package
under the terms and conditions of a Government contract, as either a prime contractor or subcontractor, would not
apply to work performed for private contractors. EPA does not generate statements of work or solicitations for the
use and benefit of a private party. Therefore, no clarification to the clause is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ARCS contracts provide for a contractor's involvement with the complete cleanup of a site from the beginning to
the end, including follow-on remedial action projects. The LOFC clause for the ARCS contracts has been specifically
written to accommodate the special nature of the ARCS program to take advantage of a contractor's expertise and keep
the competitive base as open as possible, especially when EPA has purchased the technology. Therefore, we disagree
with the comment that the clause should be expanded to make any contractors, which participate in the development
of the statement of work or solicitation package, ineligible from participating in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. To make ARCS contractors ineligible would be overly restrictive and disruptive to the Superfund program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Basic LOFC clause (ARCS) paragraph (c)_Broaden limitation. One commenter recommended that we broaden this paragraph
to exclude a contractor from working for any party on any contract for the types of work specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. Such a change would be too restrictive to ARCS contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Alternate I (TCRR) paragraph (d)(3)_Applicability of TAT restriction. One commenter recommended that the clause
be clarified to indicate the TAT restriction in the TCRR clause only applies to TAT type contracts offered by the Federal
Government because if it applied to both Government and the private sector it would be overly broad and restrictive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree. The clause as written clearly requires TCRR contractors to request approval prior to performing TAT
type activities, regardless of whether another Federal agency or a private party issues the contract. A TCRR contractor
is required to provide cleanup services on numerous sites within its respective geographic area and this work often
involves work performed in ``emergency'' situations. It is vital that TCRR contractors be free of conflicts to perform
work for the Agency. Therefore, it is necessary to require TCRR contractors to request approval before performing
any TAT type activities for any other party within its respective geographic area that result from a CERCLA administrative
order, a CERCLA or RCRA consent decree or a court order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(2)_Expand competition restriction. One commenter requested we delete the
language ``Unless an individual design for the site has been prepared by a third party''. The commenter contended
that any knowledge of a site is critical and a contractor having access to a site over a long period of time would be in
a better position to plan and price for unforeseen contingencies. Therefore, this would be patently unfair to other
contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. If the clause were to be modified as suggested, it would have the opposite effect by making the clause overly
restrictive for contractors performing TAT work. Although such a contractor may have gained some knowledge about
a site while working there, it would not necessarily be an unfair competitive advantage when a third party has prepared
the design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(2)_Inability to plan future TAT work. One commenter suggested that this paragraph
not include TAT work that a contractor plans to perform because contractors have no role in determining future TAT
work and TAT work dealing with emergencies cannot be planned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. In many cases, TAT work is planned and advance site information is provided to contractors by EPA. Therefore,
the final clause includes the requirement that a contractor shall not perform remedial construction work on a site
where it has knowledge that it will be performing TAT work for EPA, unless otherwise authorized by the EPA Contracting
Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Alternate II (TAT) paragraph (d)(3)_Site specific limitations. One commenter suggested the restriction on
TAT contractors be site specific rather than a restriction covering the entire zone. The commenter further stated
that alternate zone contractors should be used if conflicts arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. TAT contracts are established to provide TAT type activities, including TCRR oversight, on potentially
all sites within the geographic area. If contractors perform work for PRPs on sites within the geographic area, and
if EPA were to require oversight on these sites, EPA's ability to plan and promptly commence oversight work would be
significantly impaired. Geographic crossovers are possible in a few unusual circumstances. However, the administrative
cost and additional time associated with this process for a number of sites pose too large a risk to the effective operation
of the TAT program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Alternate III (ESAT)_LOFC applicability to ESAT. One commenter recommended we delete this Alternate since an
LOFC clause is not appropriate for ESAT work. We disagree. This clause contains the limitation on future performance
where the contractor develops the specifications or statement of work under a Superfund contract. This limitation
is common to all Superfund contracts including ESAT.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. Alternate IV (TES) paragraph (b)_Remove or limit restriction. One commenter suggested that the TES LOFC clause
be limited to CERCLA activities by a private party at the NPL sites where work was performed under TES contracts. The
commenter stated that requiring future contracting requests for any work of a remedial nature within the regions
covered by a TES contract is arbitrary and inconsistent with the requirements of actual site work required under other
EPA contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is our intent for paragraph (b) to cover the entire geographic area covered by the contract. The TES clause coverage
is different than the other clauses because of the special sensitivity of TES work which includes support for enforcement
cases. We have seriously considered the recommendation to change this language. However, because of the high sensitivity
of enforcement work, we believe this provision is necessary to best protect the Agency's enforcement and cost recovery
cases. Moreover, because of the sensitivity of all Superfund enforcement work, the clause cannot just be limited
to CERCLA activities at NPL sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Alternate IV (TES) paragraph (d)_Broaden TES LOFC restriction. One commenter recommended TES contractors should
be absolutely prohibited from working for private sector PRPs in order to avoid the potential for compromising enforcement
related data. Although we agree that TES work is highly sensitive, we believe the rule provides adequate measures
to protect EPA's interests. To broaden the LOFC clause would be too restrictive to competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Alternate V (Headquarters Support) paragraph (c)_Response action work. Several commenters expressed concern
about the vagueness of the term ``response action work'' and asked if it had the same meaning as the SARA definition
of ``response action contract''. To clarify the term ``response action work'', we included a number of examples in
the proposed and the final clause. The examples in the final clause include ARCS, TCRR, TAT, and TES contracts. It is
our intention that ``response action work'' have the same definition as ``response action contract'' provided in
CERCLA Section 119, as amended by SARA. However, we have included, in the prescription to this clause, authorization
for the Contracting Officer to modify this paragraph to reflect any unique limitations applicable to the program
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Alternate VI (Site Specific)_Site specific contracts for construction or other non-discretionary work. Some
commenters assumed that this clause would primarily affect construction contractors and recommended that EPA not
apply this clause to site specific contracts which are for construction. Another commenter suggested that work which
a contractor believes is non-discretionary should also be exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree. When a solicitation, prime contract or work assignment is issued solely for construction work or for
work that the contractor believes is non-discretionary, the offeror or contractor can request that the LOFC clause
be modified or waived. The Contracting Officer has the authority to approve the request if the work does not pose a high
risk of conflict to the Superfund program. Under Alternate VI, to ensure that prime contractors clearly understand
they have the option of requesting a waiver from or modification of this clause when non-discretionary work is performed,
language has been added to Alternate VI, describing how to obtain a waiver or modification from the Contracting Officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Alternate VI (Site Specific) paragraph (b)_Site specifications. One commenter suggested that the words ``for
the site'' be inserted in paragraph (b) of the clause so that the clause would only apply to EPA solicitations for the
site. We disagree. Specifications could be developed under a site specific contract which may be included in other
EPA solicitations.

As a result of public comment, the following changes are made to the clause and its prescription: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The proposed annual certification requirement is changed from applying to all Superfund contracts to only contracts
where the contract does not include the submission of other conflict of interest certifications during contract
performance. Superfund contracts requiring annual certification include: Site Specific contracts and the Contract
Laboratory Program (CLP) and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts. This change is made in response to comments
that multiple certification requirements are duplicative and overburdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_To reduce reporting requirements, the update of conflict of interest plan requirement, which was included in the
proposed rule's clause, EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;78, Annual Certification and Update of Conflict of Interest Plan,
has been deleted. Its prescription has also been removed from the proposed rule's prescription, EPAAR 1510.011&hyph;78,
Annual Certification and Update of Conflict of Interest Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The annual certification requirement in the proposed rule's EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;78 and the prescription EPAAR
1510.011&hyph;78 is designated, under the final rule, as EPAAR 1552.210&hyph;80, Annual Certification, and its
prescription is EPAAR 1510.011&hyph;80, Annual Certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The requirement that contractors certify annually that all personal conflicts of interest have been reported is
changed to ``the Contractor shall certify that it has informed its personnel who perform work under EPA contracts
or relating to EPA contracts of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of interest to the
contractors.'' This change was made in response to public comments that it is unfair and overburdensome to require
contractors to certify that personal conflicts have been reported since contractors have to rely on their personnel
to report such conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The prescription to this clause has been changed to be consistent with the prescription to the Organizational Conflict
of Interest Clause. The final prescription, EPAAR 1510.011&hyph;80, Annual Certification, includes a small purchase
limitation threshold.

Other comments and our response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Timing of submittal of annual certification. One comment expressed concern that the timing of the annual certification
should be changed to a date certain or tied to a company's fiscal year calendar. We retain the requirement that the annual
certification cover a one year period from time of award, and all subsequent certifications shall cover successive
annual periods thereafter. Such certification must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 45 days after
the close of the certification period covered. However, if a contractor has sufficient justification to change the
filing date, the contractor may submit a request to the Contracting Officer who can consider the request for an adjustment
and has the authority to modify the contract accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments and our response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Clarification of conflict of interest plan, evaluation process and confidential data. Some commenters recommended
that we clarify what should be in a conflict of interest plan and the evaluation process and exclude confidential data.
Conflict of interest plans are only required for solicitations in which the Contracting Officer makes a determination
that a significant potential for conflict of interest exists. Any requirements for conflict of interest plans and
information regarding their evaluation will be included in individual solicitations. If any confidential information
is provided, e.g., sensitive corporate structure information, the contractor should mark it accordingly and it
will be safeguarded to the full extent of the law.

EPAAR 1552.212&hyph;71, Work Assignments, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is amended to add two alternate clauses to be used for all Superfund contracts which do not require annual certifications.
The alternate clauses require contractors to certify within 20 days of receipt of a work assignment that all actual
or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer, or that no actual,
or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist. Where work assignments are issued under a contract for
work related to a site, a contractor is only required to provide a certification for the first work assignment issued
for that site under the contract. In addition, the clauses require a contractor to certify that its personnel who perform
work under this work assignment or relating to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report
personal and organizational conflicts of interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to public comments the following changes have been made:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The work assignment certification requirement under the proposed rule has been reduced from applying to all Superfund
contracts to only Superfund contracts that are not required to submit annual certifications in accordance with EPAAR
1552.210&hyph;80. This change was made in response to comments that the certification requirements were overly
burdensome and duplicative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The final rule's prescription to the work assignment clause, paragraph (b) of EPAAR 1512.104, Contract clauses,
reflects the reduction in certification requirement by stating that the work assignment certification provision
is not used for contracts which require annual conflict of interest certifications (e.g., Site Specific contracts
and the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) and the Sample Management Office (SMO) contracts). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The number of work assignment certifications required has also been reduced to minimize contractor burden. Where
contracts include site work, the final clause only requires contractors to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment under the contract issued for that site. For all subsequent work for that site, under
the contract, the contractor has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts but
no additional conflict of interest certifications are required. To reflect this obligation, the certification
includes a statement that the contractor recognizes its continuing obligation to identify and report any actual
or potential conflict of interest arising during performance of this work assignment or other work related to this
site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The time of work assignment certification has been extended to 20 days after receipt of work assignment. This change
was made in response to comments that five days is insufficient time to search and certify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate I affirmatively provides that a contractor must, as a minimum requirement, search through its immediate
past three years of records prior to submitting its certification. Language has been added to the clause to minimize
any misunderstandings about how far back contractors must search. Although contractors are only required to affirmatively
search back through the past three years of records, contractors are always required to report any conflicts of which
they are aware.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The requirement that a contractor certify that all personal conflicts of interest have been reported has been removed.
The final clause requires a contractor to certify only that it has informed its personnel who perform work under this
work assignment or relating to this work assignment of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts
of interest to the contractor. This change was made in response to public comments that it is unfair and too burdensome
to require contractors to certify that personal conflicts have been reported since contractors have to rely on their
personnel to report such conflicts and all that should be required is a good faith effort to obtain such information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The term ``apparent'' has been removed from this clause in response to comments that the term is vague and difficult
to define. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Alternate II to the Work Assignment clause provides for a transition period for contractors who do not have three
years of records to search. The contractor will be required to search any records that it has, until over time, three
years of records are accumulated. The contractor is still always required to report any conflicts of which it is aware.

EPAAR 1552.227&hyph;76, Project Employee Confidentiality Agreement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is added to ensure that EPA enforcement efforts under the Superfund program are not damaged by contractor employees'
release of information which has either been provided to the contractor by the Government or first generated under
contract. Employees of contractors will be prohibited from release of such information to any parties external to
EPA, the Department of Justice or the contractor without permission of the EPA Contracting Officer. Superfund contractors
will be required to obtain confidentiality agreements from all employees working on requirements under the contract.
The contractor must also include the clause in all subcontracts and consultant agreements unless specifically excluded
under this clause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

is redundant because of the mandatory flow down provision; and (2) commenters' mistaken interpretation that the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The language in the prescription to this clause, EPAAR 1527.409 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses,
has been changed to be consistent with prescription for the Organizational Conflict of Interest Clause. The final
prescription includes a small purchase limitation threshold.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other comments and EPA's response include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Exemption of lower level employees. Some commenters stated that contractors' lower level employees should be
exempted from the requirement that contractors obtain confidentiality agreements from all employees working under
requirements of the EPA contract. We disagree. Because of the sensitivity of Superfund work and the potential for
serious damage to enforcement efforts as a result of unauthorized release of information at any level, we cannot exempt
any employees working under the requirements of the EPA contract. However, it is not our intention to impose an undue
hardship on our contractors. To comply with this clause, it would suffice for contractors to obtain one non-disclosure
agreement from its employees who work on multiple EPA contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Scope of information. One commenter stated that it is unrealistic to limit discussion of information already in
the public domain and one commenter stated that this clause should not preclude disclosure of information routinely
disclosed in the normal course of business. We disagree. This clause's limitation is on data of a sensitive nature
provided by the Government or first generated during contract performance. Such information should not be categorically
authorized for release. However, if a contractor believes such information may be releasable, the contractor may,
on a case-by-case basis, request written permission from the EPA Contracting Officer to disclose such information.
Such requests will be carefully evaluated to ensure adequate protection of sensitive information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Liability for post-employment release of information. One commenter expressed concern that contractors have
no control over employees after their employment and that EPA should make it clear that contractors are not liable
for employees who have left their employment. We agree that contractors should not be held liable for employees breaching
confidentiality agreements after they have left the firm. The intent of this clause is to have contractors obtain
confidentiality agreements from employees to ensure that employees are aware of their obligation not to disclose
sensitive information.

Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector

(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is strengthening its existing Organizational Conflict of Interest EPAAR Clause and adding additional coverage
in the EPAAR to guard against conflicts of interest in work performed under Superfund contracts. Prime contractors,
non-exempted subcontractors and consultants working under EPA Superfund contracts will be required to have employees
working on requirements under contract sign confidentiality agreements. Prime contractors will be required to:
notify EPA immediately of any conflicts of interest regarding contractor or subcontractor personnel working on
the EPA contract; submit to EPA either a one time per site certification for work issued under a work assignment or an
annual certification concerning disclosure of conflicts of interest; and seek Contracting Officer approval of
other work when such work might conflict with work performed under an EPA contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Affected small entities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small entities awarded EPA Superfund contracts or small entities serving as subcontractors or consultants under
EPA Superfund contracts will be affected. Presently, approximately 75 small entities are performing such contracts
and subcontracts. It is impossible to estimate the number of small businesses that ultimately will receive EPA Superfund
contracts or serve as subcontractors or consultants under these contracts and, thereby, be affected by this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of projected reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We estimate that businesses generally maintain data on the work previously performed by the company in their normal
business practices which may also be used to prevent conflicts of interest. For entities that maintain this data,
there will be limited additional costs associated with reviewing, evaluating, and reporting work previously performed
and future work being considered that may pose a conflict of interest. EPA does not require any special type of system
to identify and report conflicts. Each contractor determines its own procedures for searching and identifying conflicts
of interest, and in some cases, it may already have a process in place to identify conflicts in its commercial business.
An automated system to store and retrieve information is not required in order to perform the functions associated
with a conflict of interest system. We anticipate that the scope of a company's procedures would be commensurate with
the company's size and complexity, and for small businesses any system should be less complex and detailed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a significant portion of small business participation in EPA programs occurs under subcontracts for classes
of work which are exempt under EPA's conflict of interest clauses, many small businesses will not be affected by the
provisions of this rule. Moreover, at any time, a small business operating as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor
may request waiver of clause requirements for non-discretionary work which poses a minimal risk of conflict of interest.
The total impact upon small business should be significantly less than the impact upon large business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending on the specific contract, contractors will either be required to certify annually that all actual or potential
conflicts of interest have been reported to EPA during the preceding year of the contract or certify on a work assignment
basis for work first performed at a site. The significant change to the final rule, in which certifications have been
reduced from three to one, results in a substantial reduction in the total effort required to comply with the requirements
of this rule. Because small businesses generally have less complex organizational structures and less data to maintain
and search, the burden associated with search and certification requirements for small business should be substantially
less than the burden applicable to a large business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA anticipates that any cost increases experienced by these entities may be chargeable to Government contracts
under the provisions of FAR Part 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to concerns about data and certification burden which have been addressed above, a comment was submitted
expressing concern that responding to the questionnaire, which EPA included in a January 1990, memorandum regarding
conflicts of interest, would add significantly to the contractor burden. As stated in Part B of the preamble to this
rule, General Comments, this memorandum has been superseded, and the questionnaire is not required. Another commenter
expressed concern that the burden associated with requests for future contracting had not been considered in the
calculation of burden. In fact, the burden associated with requests for future contracting was considered in this
analysis and is reflected in the calculations contained in the initial and final Information Collection Request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal rules which may duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The EPA reviewed the FAR coverage on organizational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conflicts of interest and rights in data, which this rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR requires Contracting Officers to identify and evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest
before contract award and to avoid, neutralize or mitigate significant potential conflicts. This rule fulfills
and is consistent with these requirements. In addition, this rule will address limitations on a firm's other contracting
efforts during contract performance, and in some cases after completion of the work assignment or other similar tasking
document, or after performance of the EPA work contract. The FAR also recognizes that Federal agencies may restrict
a contractor's right to distribute or use data first produced in performance of a contract when necessary in the furtherance
of the agency mission objectives. The rule's requirement for contractor employees working under Superfund contracts
to sign confidentiality agreements restricting release of contract data and other information generally conforms
to these FAR requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also reviewed FAR subpart 9.5 Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest which deals with conflict
of interest standards for advisory and assistance service contracts and marketing consultants to contractors.
The EPA rule specifically addresses EPA contracts and subcontracts under the Superfund program. Although the FAR
guidance and the EPA rule have the same general objectives of identifying, avoiding mitigating, and neutralizing
conflicts of interest, the EPA provisions include reporting requirements to ensure that conflicts of interest are
reviewed not only prior to contract award, but also during the period of contract performance and after contract performance
to ensure enforcement actions are not jeopardized. It is only in this way that EPA can examine whether a contractor's
work efforts, which may be initiated during the EPA contract performance period or in some cases thereafter, may present
an unacceptable risk to the Agency. This rule does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with other Federal rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternatives to the rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA considered alternatives to the final rule, such as establishing different compliance or reporting requirements
or simplifying the requirements for small entities. EPA also considered exempting small entities from all or part
of the rule. EPA concluded that the stated objectives cannot be met under such alternatives. An undisclosed conflict
of interest poses the same risk to EPA whether it is a conflict involving a large or small business contractor. EPA believes
the final rule, along with other established internal controls within the Agency, will avoid actual or potential
conflicts of interest that may jeopardize future actions by the Agency.

a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to: (1) any work relating to CERCLA activities
which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed work for EPA under this contract; or (2) any work
that may jeopardize CERCLA enforcement actions which pertain to the site where the Contractor previously performed
work for the EPA under this contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) During the life of this contract, including any options, the Contractor agrees that unless otherwise authorized
by the Contracting Officer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It will not provide any Technical Assistance Team (TAT) type activities (e.g., TAT contracts) to EPA on the site
either as a prime contractor, subcontractor, or consultant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It will be ineligible for award of contracts pertaining to this site which result from a CERCLA administrative
order, a CERCLA or RCRA consent decree or a court order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Contractor agrees in advance that if any bids/proposals are submitted for any work that would require written
approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into a contract subject to the restrictions of this clause,
then the bids/proposals are submitted at the Contractor's own risk. Therefore, no claim shall be made against the
Government to recover bid/proposal costs as a direct cost whether the request for authorization to enter into the
contract is denied or approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) To the extent that the work under this contract requires access to proprietary or confidential business or financial
data of other companies, and as long as such data remains proprietary or confidential, the Contractor shall protect
such data from unauthorized use and disclosure.

(g) Contractors who are performing nondiscretionary technical or engineering services, including construction
work, may request a waiver from or modification to this clause by submitting a written request to the Contracting Officer.
The Contracting Officer shall make the determination regarding whether to waive or modify the clause on a case-by-case
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Contractor agrees to insert in each subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except for subcontracts
or consultant agreements for nondiscretionary technical or engineering services, including treatability studies,
well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, or electrical services, provisions
which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (h) unless otherwise
authorized by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer exempt
from this clause a particular subcontract or consultant agreement for nondiscretionary technical or engineering
services not specifically listed above, including laboratory analysis. The Contracting Officer will review and
evaluate each request on a case-by-case basis before approving or disapproving the request.

(i) If the Contractor seeks an expedited decision regarding its initial future contracting request, the Contractor
may submit its request to both the Contracting Officer and the next administrative level within the Contracting Officer's

(j) A review process available to the Contractor when an adverse determination is received shall consist of a request
for reconsideration to the Contracting Officer or a request for review submitted to the next administrative level
within the Contracting Officer's organization. An adverse determination resulting from a request for reconsideration
by the Contracting Officer will not preclude the Contractor from requesting a review by the next administrative level.
Either a request for review or a request for reconsideration must be submitted to the appropriate level within 30 calendar
days after receipt of the initial adverse determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict
of interest certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for
work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor
has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional
conflict of interest certifications are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the contractor shall search its records accumulated,
at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document.
In the COI certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all
actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer or that to
the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist.
In addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating
to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of
interest to the Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternate II.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As prescribed in 1512.104(b), modify the existing clause by adding the following paragraph (f) to the basic clause:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Within 20 days of receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document, the Contractor shall provide a conflict
of interest certification. Where work assignments or similar tasking documents are issued under this contract for
work on or directly related to a site, the Contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification
for the first work assignment issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site under this contract, the Contractor
has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional
conflict of interest certifications are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before submitting the conflict of interest certification, the contractor shall initially search through all of
its available records to identify any actual or potential conflicts of interest. During the first three years of this
contract, the contractor shall search through all records created since the beginning of the contract plus the records
of the contractor prior to the award of the contract until a minimum of three years of records are accumulated. Once
three years of records have accumulated, prior to certifying, the contractor shall search its records accumulated,
at a minimum, over the past three years immediately prior to the receipt of the work assignment or similar tasking document.
In the certification, the Contractor must certify to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, that all actual
or potential organizational conflicts of interest have been reported to the Contracting Officer or that to the best
of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, no actual or potential organizational conflicts of interest exist. In
addition, the Contractor must certify that its personnel who perform work under this work assignment or relating
to this work assignment have been informed of their obligation to report personal and organizational conflicts of
interest to the Contractor. The certification shall also include a statement that the Contractor recognizes its
continuing obligation to identify and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest arising during performance
of this work assignment or other work related to this site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Contractor recognizes that Contractor employees in performing this contract may have access to data, either
provided by the Government or first generated during contract performance, of a sensitive nature which should not
be released to the public without Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval. Therefore, the Contractor agrees
to obtain confidentiality agreements from all of its employees working on requirements under this contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Such agreements shall contain provisions which stipulate that each employee agrees that the employee will not
disclose, either in whole or in part, to any entity external to EPA, the Department of Justice, or the Contractor, any
information or data (as defined in FAR Section 27.401) provided by the Government or first generated by the Contractor
under this contract, any site-specific cost information, or any enforcement strategy without first obtaining the
written permission of the EPA Contracting Officer. If a contractor, through an employee or otherwise, is subpoenaed
to testify or produce documents, which could result in such disclosure, the Contractor must provide immediate advance
notification to the EPA so that the EPA can authorize such disclosure or have the opportunity to take action to prevent
such disclosure. Such agreements shall be effective for the life of the contract and for a period of five (5) years after
completion of the contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The EPA may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary
to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information to outside entities. If such a disclosure occurs without the
written permission of the EPA Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract, for default or convenience,
or pursue other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Contractor further agrees to insert in any subcontract or consultant agreement placed hereunder, except
for subcontracts or consultant agreements for well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security
guard services, or electrical services, provisions which shall conform substantially to the language of this clause,
including this paragraph, unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program have been approved by the
Office of Management and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520),
and assigned OMB control number 2501&hyph;0013. This interim rule does not contain additional information collection
requirements.

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) was enacted under title II (42 U.S.C. 12701&hyph;12839) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November 28, 1990). On March 19, 1991, the
Department published a proposed rule (56 FR 11592) to implement the HOME Program. The Department received 119 public
comments in response to the proposed rule. After reviewing and considering these comments, HUD published an interim
rule on December 16, 1991 (56 FR 65313), inviting additional comments on the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received 118 public comments on the interim rule. In partial response to these comments and HUD's experience
in implementing the program, an interim rule to make necessary changes on an expedited basis to the December 16, 1991
interim rule was developed. In addition, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCDA 1992) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550,
approved October 28, 1992) included a substantial number of amendments to the HOME program. Some of the HCDA 1992 amendments
that were determined to be immediately effective were included in the ``necessary changes'' interim rule, which
was published on December 22, 1992 (57 FR 60960). The remaining HCDA 1992 amendments determined to be immediately
effective were published in an interim rule on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other HCDA 1992 changes were determined to require the publication of a proposed rule with an opportunity for public
notice and comment before they could be implemented. A proposed rule for this purpose was published on April 29, 1993
(58 FR 26048). The Department received 21 comments in response to the proposed rule. Twelve were from state agencies;
four were from local agencies; and five comments were from associations. This rule implements the April 29, 1993 proposed
rule as an interim rule. This rule is being published as an interim rule and not as a final rule because the HOME program
regulation at 24 CFR part 92 has not yet been issued as a final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to implementing the April 29 proposed rule, this interim rule addresses two additional areas of necessary
amendments to the HOME regulation. First, a number of clarifying revisions are made to the HOME regulation to provide
additional guidance for program participants, as explained below in the discussion of changes made to individual
sections. Second, Departmental staff reviewed the HOME rule in relationship to the Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) Program, and developed a number of recommendations for greater compatibility between the HOME and CDBG
regulations which are included in this interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion, arranged according to the sequence of the HOME rule sections being considered, summarizes
and responds to the comments received, and describes the changes made to the HOME Program regulation in this interim
rule. Unless otherwise indicated in this preamble, the portions of this rule that were a part of the proposed rule remain
the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;92.2, the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commitment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is revised. The Department believes greater flexibility in the definition of commitment is required to give participating
jurisdictions additional time to use their HOME allocations. In addition to commitments to specific projects which
are recognized as legally binding agreements between PJs and project owners, the Department is expanding the definition
of commitment. The expanded definition would count as commitments legally binding agreements with State recipients,
subrecipients, contractors or reservation of funds by Community Housing Development Organizations (CHDOs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initially, the Department believed that additional flexibility was warranted for FY1992 funds because of the slow
start-up of the program based on initial statutory complexity. With both significant statutory amendments of the
Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and regulatory simplification by the Department, the ability of States
and local governments to operate the HOME Program has now been increased. Nonetheless, the Department recognizes
that to build upon the momentum of these changes, an expansion of the definition will provide regulatory relief to
allow funds to be committed to both state recipients, subrecipients and CHDOs in a more orderly and equitable fashion.
States can work with small cities and recently formed nonprofits to build capacity without fear of losing funds in
the short term. Local participating jurisdictions may also take on more difficult rental projects with nonprofits
which serve very-low income families or special populations, which often require greater development time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will provide additional guidance on how these commitments will be documented for purposes of meeting
the commitment deadlines. While the Department is providing greater flexibility on commitments, it will continue
to collect information on commitments to specific projects and will maintain its emphasis on this aspect of the program
both in reporting and monitoring of participating jurisdictions. All cash and management procedures will remain
in effect with regard to reporting and disbursement of HOME funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commit to a specific local project, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
included within the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
commitment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is revised by changing the start construction period for publicly owned projects from six months to twelve months.
This change will make the start construction period for publicly owned projects consistent with the start construction
period for privately owned projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
community housing development organization 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in &sect;92.2 is revised to specify that this term means a private nonprofit organization that has a tax-exempt ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service under section 501(c) (3) or (4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The definition
did not previously include the reference to paragraph (3) or (4) of section 501. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
housing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in &sect;92.2 is revised to include elder cottage housing opportunity (ECHO) units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the ``footprint'' foundation requirements present in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reconstruction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be eased to give participating jurisdictions (PJs) the decision-making ability to waive the requirement
if the situation warrants. The Department agrees that additional flexibility may be needed, for example, to permit
PJs to meet current zoning requirements that would affect the reconstruction site. The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
reconstruction
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at &sect;92.2 is modified to permit a unit to be reconstructed anywhere on the existing lot. However, all other Federal
requirements of subpart H would still be applicable to the project.

A new &sect;92.4 is added to implement a Department-wide policy that provides for the expiration of interim rules
within a set period of time if they are not issued in final form before the end of the period. The expiration period may
be extended by notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The expiration date for the HOME interim rule is June 30, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While reconstruction is considered a rehabilitation activity for the general purposes of the HOME Program, this
would not always be the case for complying with the environmental review requirements at &sect;92.352. If a HOME-assisted
project is reconstructed upon the same foundation or footprint as the original structure, it may be treated as a rehabilitation
project for the purposes of complying with part 50 and part 58. However, the reconstruction of a structure on another
portion of the lot must be treated as new construction for purposes of part 50 and part 58. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The treatment of administrative costs as eligible HOME costs is clarified in this rule. The definition of administrative
costs is removed from &sect;92.2 and incorporated into &sect;92.207, a section previously held in reserve, where
administrative and planning costs are listed as eligible costs. The reference to project delivery costs that were
a part of the definition of administrative costs is deleted and a more specific and useful reference is made to staff
and overhead costs directly related to a project. In addition, participating jurisdictions are given the option
of charging such staff and overhead costs as a ``related soft cost'' of a project, under a new &sect;92.206(c)(6),
or as an administrative cost under &sect;92.207. If charged as an administrative cost, these costs are included in
the ten percent cap applicable to administrative and planning costs. If charged to specific projects as related soft
costs, these costs must be prorated among HOME-assisted units, and are subject to the maximum per unit subsidy limits
and matching requirements.

A typographical error in the definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
single room occupancy
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in &sect;92.2 is corrected by replacing, in the third sentence of the definition, the word ``residual'' with ``residential.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.50(f) is redesignated as &sect;92.50(d)(5), and its applicability is limited to paragraph 92.50(d)
to conform to the intent expressed in Amendment No. 15 on page 14 of H.Rept. 103&hyph;273, the Conference Report for
the Department's 1994 Fiscal Year appropriations with regard to minimum thresholds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference to ``housing strategy'' is deleted from the title of &sect;92.61, since insular areas are no longer
required to have one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A correction to &sect;92.64(a)(1) (dealing with the applicability of HOME program requirements to insular areas)
is made to delete references to &sect;&sect;92.208 through 92.210, which have been revised since first being cited
in this section, and to the prohibition against using HOME funds to defray administrative costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.150(b)(2) is revised to include the new eligible activities_administrative expenses, and community
housing development organization (CHDO) operating expenses_as required in the program description that participating
jurisdictions must submit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is made to &sect;92.204(a)(1) to remove the reference to &sect;&sect;92.208 through 92.210,
which is no longer relevant because of amendments made to these sections.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;92.205(a)(1), the reference to specific eligible costs at the end of the paragraph is revised to include
&sect;&sect;92.206 through 92.209, in accordance with the reorganization of sections dealing with eligible costs,
as described in the following preamble paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The listing of eligible costs is reorganized in this rule. Rather than listing all eligible costs at &sect;92.206,
eligible costs are listed, starting at &sect;92.206 and continuing through previously reserved &sect;&sect;92.207,
92.208, and 92.209, by the type of cost. Thus, &sect;92.206 now covers only eligible project costs; &sect;92.207
covers eligible administrative and planning costs; &sect;92.208 deals with eligible CHDO operating expense costs;
and &sect;92.209 covers eligible costs related to tenant-based rental assistance. Within these sections, clarifying
changes are made as explained below. In addition, conforming changes throughout part 92 to reflect the new section
numbers of eligible costs are made by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(a)(2) is amended to permit the refinancing of secured, existing debt on a single family, owner-occupied
unit when 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
lending
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 program funds to rehabilitate the unit, if overall housing costs of the borrower will be reduced and made more affordable.
This means a PJ can make one loan to the homeowner to repay existing private debt and provide the rehabilitation loan.
HOME funds cannot be used to pay the transaction costs of privately refinancing the existing debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(a)(3) is revised to clarify the eligibility of demolition, utility connections and site improvements
associated with new construction and rehabilitation. This section clarifies that off-site utility connections
from the property line to the adjacent street are eligible. It also provides that site improvements may include on-site
roads and water and sewer lines necessary to the development of the project. The project site is defined as the property,
owned by the project owner, upon which the project is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(c)(5) is clarified by adding the modifier ``project'' before ``operating expenses'' to distinguish
these costs from CHDO operating expenses, which are now covered under &sect;92.208. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, a new &sect;92.206(c)(6) makes staff and overhead costs eligible as a ``related soft cost'' of
a project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;92.206(c)(7) is added to make the payment of impact fees that are commonly charged for all projects within
a jurisdiction, an eligible cost for new construction and rehabilitation, and the prohibition against impact fees
at &sect;92.214(a)(8) is deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.206(g) is redesignated as &sect;92.208, and a technical correction is made in this section to change the
reference concerning requirements and limitations on the receipt of operating expenses by community housing development
organizations from &sect;92.301 (e) and (f) to &sect;92.300 (e) and (f). Capacity building costs under &sect;92.300(b)
are also specifically listed as eligible HOME costs in &sect;92.208(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request was received for clarification of &sect;92.211(a)(2), amended by the December 22,1992 interim rule to
implement an HCDA 1992 amendment that replaces the use of the Section 8 waiting list as the selection criterion for
families eligible to receive HOME-funded tenant-based rental assistance. This assistance is now provided in accordance
with a participating jurisdiction's written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the
purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules
established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) Questions arise because of uncertainty concerning the meaning of ``reasonably related to'' the preference rules
under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These preference rules provide for local rental assistance programs
in which at least 70% of the families assisted meet Federal preferences and 30% meet local preferences. For example,
a Federal preference exists for homeless families. The HOME tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) written selection
policy may provide a preference to families that, although not presently homeless, are likely to be homeless in the
near future. This may be the case for families in transitional housing, which is provided for only a set time period,
or for families living temporarily with relatives or friends. Section 92.211(a)(2) is amended by adding a clarifying
sentence to state that ``reasonably related'' means that the PJs may provide TBRA to families who currently meet a
Federal preference or who because of circumstances would qualify in the near future for one of the three Federal preferences
under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 without tenant-based rental assistance. These preferences are:
(1) Families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless
families); (2) families that are paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent; or (3) families that are involuntarily
displaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received that objected to the requirements at &sect;92.211(f)(3) that limit a PJ's ability to establish
TBRA payment standards based on local market conditions and a determination of rent reasonableness. The Department
agrees that participating jurisdictions should be given greater discretion in the implementation of the HOME program,
and &sect;92.211(f)(3) is amended accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to several questions concerning eligible acquisition costs, the list of prohibited activities at &sect;92.214
is revised to prohibit the use of HOME funds to acquire property owned by a participating jurisdiction, except for
property acquired by the participating jurisdiction with HOME funds, or property acquired in anticipation of carrying
out a HOME project. Such a transaction could not be considered a bona fide acquisition, since the participating jurisdiction
owns the property and is providing assistance to buy the property. The element of an arm's length transaction is not
present. This prohibition is added as paragraph (a)(8), which previously referred to impact fees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the change (which appeared in the proposed rule) to &sect;92.218(a) to substitute ``housing that qualifies
as affordable housing under the HOME program'' for ``affordable housing assisted with HOME funds,'' &sect;92.218(c)
is revised to give the new citations to the references to eligible costs. A new paragraph (e) is also added to &sect;92.218
to clarify that contributions that have been or will be counted towards satisfying a matching requirement of another
Federal grant or award may not count toward satisfying the matching contribution requirement for the HOME program.
This clarification is based on the language in the Department's common rule on uniform requirements for grants to
State and local governments at 24 CFR 85.24(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight comments opposed the policy outlined in the proposed rule that a PJ's contribution to a state or local tenant-based
rental assistance program is not eligible as match. One comment pointed out some State constitutions prohibit the
use of State funds for the development of private property. These States often have extensive TBRA programs to provide
affordable housing. If TBRA is not allowable for match purposes, then these States would be limited in their ability
to meet their match requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has been convinced by such arguments to permit local contributions to TBRA (but not related administrative
costs) to be used for match. Section 92.219(b) is amended to permit match credit for TBRA which meets the provisions
of &sect;&sect;92.210, 92.211 and 92.253(a) and (b). This parallels the approach taken for local contributions
to affordable housing which is not HOME-assisted, but which must still conform to certain HOME requirements to be
considered ``affordable.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule also provides clarification, made in response to a number of comments that requested additional
guidance, on what HOME requirements apply to projects in which state or local investment of funds are being counted
as match. PJs must establish a procedure to monitor these HOME-eligible projects to ensure continued compliance
with the requirements of 92.203 (income determinations), 92.210 (TBRA-security deposits), 92.211 (TBRA, except
for 92.211(c), Term of rental assistance contract) 92.252 (rental) 92.253 (tenant protections) and 92.254 (ownership),
but the units are not subject to the annual on-site inspections or recertification of income and rents as HOME projects
are. HOME administrative funds may be used to monitor these projects for compliance with HOME requirements. No other
HOME requirements apply, including the cross-cutting requirements of subpart H of part 92, to non-assisted projects
counted as match. Investment in units other than affordable units does not count as match, and &sect;92.219(c) is
amended to reflect this.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, contributions in HOME-eligible projects will be counted in the same manner as match contributions in
HOME-assisted projects. A contribution will be counted only to the extent it is a permanent contribution and repayments
are placed in the HOME local account. Once deposited in the HOME account the funds must be used for HOME-eligible projects;
funds from repayments do not have to be matched but can not count as match. The contribution itself may be for any eligible
forms of match except those in &sect;92.220(a) (2) and (4), which by statute must be made for affordable housing assisted
with HOME funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.220(a)(1) is expanded to clarify that repayments of matching contributions in HOME-assisted projects,
or in affordable housing projects that are not HOME-assisted in accordance with &sect;92.219(b), must be made to
the local HOME account to earn match credit for the full loan amount. In both cases, HOME-assisted and non-HOME-assisted
affordable housing projects, the contribution must be contributed permanently to the project in order to qualify
as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.220(a)(2) is revised and expanded to permit as an eligible form of match contribution all taxes, fees,
and other charges that are imposed or charged on projects and waived by a State or local government. Before this change,
only such charges waived by a participating jurisdiction were eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional guidance on the match eligibility of contributions of land is provided in this rule. The general rule that
the value of land not acquired with federal resources is a permissible form of matching contribution is still applicable.
The reason for excluding land acquired with federal resources is that the authorizing statute for the HOME Program
permits cash contributions only from non-federal resources as an eligible form of match. The ineligibility of federal
resources cannot be circumvented by purchasing land with federal resources (for example, with CDBG funds) and then
contributing the land to a HOME project in order to obtain match credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the question has arisen of whether or not the difference between the fair market value and the purchase price
of land acquired with federal resources and donated to affordable housing would be an eligible form of match. The Department
recognizes that this difference in value could qualify as an eligible contribution, but also recognizes that there
are inherent difficulties in distinguishing between when such a transaction would merely be a ``good buy'' and when
it would constitute a true contribution for match purposes. To provide guidance on this question so that match credit
may be recognized for this form of contribution, &sect;92.220(a)(3) is revised to state that the acquisition cost
in such a transaction must be demonstrably below the appraised value and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation
to affordable housing at the time of acquisition. Property that is acquired with federal assistance must be acquired
specifically for HOME-assisted housing or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to &sect;92.219(b)(2).
If these conditions are met, the full value of the difference in price may be claimed for match credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments disagreed with the prohibition in &sect;92.220(a)(5)(iii) against permitting carryover of excess
match related to bond proceeds to apply to subsequent years' 25 percent limitation. Upon reconsideration, the Department
agrees that such a carryover is appropriate, and this interim rule permits it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;92.221, the provision that defines when bond proceeds are recognized as match, which appeared as paragraph
(b)(6) in the proposed rule, is added as paragraph (a)(7). This is because in the period between the publication of
the proposed rule and this interim rule, an interim rule was published on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34130) that revised the
structure of &sect;92.221. In addition, a new paragraph (c) is added to &sect;92.221 to clarify which entity receives
match credit for a contribution. The general rule is that the PJ that makes the match investments in HOME-assisted
or HOME-eligible projects is the entity that receives the match credit. If a non-PJ makes a contribution for affordable
housing to a PJ, the PJ receives the match credit. By way of additional clarification, the interim rule also declares
that a State that makes a contribution to a local participating jurisdiction to be used for affordable housing, whether
or not HOME-assisted, may take the match credit for itself or may permit the local participating jurisdiction to recognize
the match credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven comments were received on the proposed revisions to &sect;92.222 on reduction of the matching contribution
requirement. These comments were generally favorable, especially concerning the two year match reduction period
provision at &sect;92.222(a)(4). A few comments suggested alternative criteria to use for local government participating
jurisdictions, but these criteria are established by statute, and the interim rule merely repeats the statutory
language. There were also suggestions to use other distress criteria, such as changes in non-agricultural employment
or in State taxes collected, for State participating jurisdictions. However, for the reasons stated in the preamble
to the proposed rule, this portion of the interim rule remains unchanged. The list of State participating jurisdictions
that qualify for this match reduction is published as a Notice elsewhere in this issue of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a number of inquiries, this interim rule provides clarification of the adjustment of HOME rents. Section
92.252(a)(1) requires that in order to qualify as affordable housing, a project must bear rents not greater than the
lesser of FMR or 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose gross income equals 65 percent of the median income
for the area. Section 92.252(a)(2) requires further rent limitations on the 20 percent of units in each project which
must be occupied by very low-income families. The adjustment of qualifying rents is addressed in &sect;92.252(d),
which is amended to clarify that the rent ceilings for HOME projects do not fall below the HOME rent for the project in
effect at the time of project commitment. This is permitted to ensure the continued financial viability of the project
and for consistency with the low-income housing tax credit statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.252(a)(2) includes as a rent limitation for the qualification of projects with three or more rental units
as affordable housing that not less than 20 percent of the units be occupied by very low-income families and bear rents
not greater than 30 percent of the gross income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the
area. The Department has received indications that, depending upon the FMR or the differences in adjusted and gross
income, the use of this formula, which is intended to produce a lower HOME rent than that computed under &sect;92.252(a)(1),
results in a higher rent than under &sect;92.252(a)(1). To prevent very low-income families from potentially paying
more rent than low-income families, a new &sect;92.252(a)(2)(iii) is added to specify that the lowest rent computed
under either &sect;&sect;92.252(a) (1) or (2) is applicable to units occupied by very low-income families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A correction is made in this interim rule concerning the foreclosure provisions of &sect;92.252(a)(5) to parallel
the revision made in the June 23, 1993 interim rule to &sect;92.254(a)(4)(i)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A number of clarifying amendments are being made to the homeownership affordability requirements of &sect;92.254(a).
In response to comments criticizing the length of the affordability period imposed upon first-time homebuyers regardless
of the amount of HOME assistance received, this interim rule amends &sect;92.254(a) to make it conform to the &sect;92.252(a)(5)
table that provides differing affordability periods for rental units depending upon the amount of the HOME investment.
The 20-year affordability period for newly constructed housing, regardless of the amount of HOME funds invested,
has been eliminated for homeownership activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional clarifying changes are made to &sect;92.254(a) in this rule. A sentence is added to &sect;92.254(a)(4)(ii)(C)
to specify that the HOME investment subject to recapture is the HOME assistance that enabled the first-time homebuyer
to buy the dwelling unit, including any HOME assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an
affordable price, such as subsidizing construction financing costs or other development costs. The second change
to this section provides guidance with respect to two-to-four unit first-time homebuyer projects. New paragraph
(a)(4)(ii)(D) states that when HOME funds are used in two-to-four unit first-time homebuyer projects, upon recapture
of the HOME funds the affordability periods on the rental units may be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Technical corrections to change the references to 24 CFR 203.18(b) in &sect;&sect;92.254(a)(1)(i) and 92.254(b)(1)(i)
to 24 CFR 203.18b are made by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six comments were received regarding the ``floating'' units amendment to &sect;92.255, all of them favorable. As
explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department is amending the procedure for housing project owners
to designate those units in a property that are HOME-assisted units. Formerly, specific units were designated as
the HOME units, and that designation was fixed for the term of the affordability period. To provide more program flexibility,
this interim rule adds new language to &sect;92.255 that permits the participating jurisdiction to use a system of
``floating'' units that may be changed over the affordability period, so long as the total number of units remains
the same and the substituted units are at least comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms to the
originally designated HOME-assisted units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional guidance is provided in &sect;92.256 by clarifying that the requirement that residential living space
must constitute at least 51 percent of the project space is significant only for purposes of counting the contribution
in the non-residential portion of the property as match. The concern in making this change is that this section was
being misinterpreted to mean that a project required at least 51 percent residential living space to permit the use
of HOME funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ECHO housing provisions of &sect;&sect;92.259 and 92.625 were addressed in two comments that were generally
favorable. One of the comments pointed out differences in the two sections and recommended that they be made uniform.
The two sections are, in fact, identical except for the differences necessary to accommodate the general HOME program
and the program as modified for Indian tribes in subpart M of the rule.

In &sect;92.300(b), the language concerning the availability of a percentage of the minimum CHDO setaside for capacity
building is amended from ``may be expended'' to ``may be committed'' to allow participating jurisdictions more flexibility
in using HOME funds for this purpose. Corrections are made to change the references in &sect;&sect;92.300 (e) and
(f) from operating expenses provided under &sect;92.206(g) to operating expenses provided under &sect;92.208,
and to change the reference in &sect;92.300(f) from administrative funds under &sect;92.206(f) to administrative
funds under &sect;92.207, to conform these citations to this rule's reorganization of eligible costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 92.354(a) is revised to clarify the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to the HOME Program. The revision
makes clear that the Davis-Bacon wage provisions apply if HOME funds are used for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 project costs (as defined at &sect;92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12
or more assisted units. Once applicable, these wage provisions apply to all laborers and mechanics employed in the
development of the entire project, as defined in &sect;92.2, including portions other than the assisted units. The
interim rule specifies that if HOME funds are only used to assist first-time homebuyers to acquire single-family
housing and not for any other project costs, these wage provisions apply to the construction of housing containing
12 or more units when there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that the HOME funds will
be used to assist first-time homebuyers to buy the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conforming change is made to &sect;92.502(b)(1) that is necessary because of the amendment made to the definition
of commitment in &sect;92.2, discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule eases the requirements of &sect;92.504(e)(1) by permitting on-site review once within a two-year
period for rental housing containing 25 HOME-assisted units or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in &sect;92.508, paragraph (a)(4)(v) is revised to make a conforming change, related to the reorganization
of eligible costs, from a reference to &sect;92.206(g) to a reference to &sect;92.208.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the undersigned hereby certifies that this
interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because jurisdictions
that are statutorily eligible to receive formula allocations are relatively larger cities, counties or States.

This interim rule was listed as item number 1472 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on

Federalism Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,
Federalism, that this interim rule does not have federalism implications concerning the division of local, State,
and federal responsibilities. While the HOME Program interim rule amended by this interim rule was determined to
be a rule with federalism implications and the Department submitted a Federalism Assessment concerning the interim
rule to OMB, this amending rule only makes limited adjustments to the interim rule and does not significantly affect
any of the factors considered in the Federalism Assessment for the interim rule.

Impact on the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
interim rule would not have significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Assistance
provided under this interim rule can be expected to support family values, by helping families achieve security and
independence; by enabling them to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and by giving them the means to live independently
in mainstream American society. This interim rule would not, however, affect the institution of the family, which
is requisite to coverage by the Order. Even if this interim rule had the necessary family impact, it would not be subject
to further review under the Order, since the provision of assistance under this interim rule is required by statute,
and is not subject to agency discretion.

(2) The participating jurisdiction selects families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria
that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably
related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 70% of the families assisted
qualify, or would qualify in the near future without the tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal
preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing
(including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more
than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating
jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation
or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written
tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitated
or acquired unit or in other qualified housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Local market conditions; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) May not be less, for each unit size, than 80 percent of the published Section 8 Existing Housing fair market rent
(in effect when the payment standard amount is adopted) nor more than the fair market rent or HUD-approved community-wide
exception rent (in effect when the participating jurisdiction adopts its rent standard amount). (Community-wide
exception rents are maximum gross rents approved by HUD for the Rental Certificate Program under 882.106(a)(3) of
this title for a designated municipality, county, or similar locality, which apply to the whole PHA jurisdiction.)
A participating jurisdiction may approve on a unit-by-unit basis a subsidy based on a rent standard that exceeds the
applicable fair market rent by up to 10 percent for 20 percent of units assisted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It is made with respect to a tenant who is assisted with HOME funds; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is made with respect to HOME-assisted housing; or

except for 92.211(c), term of rental assistance contract), and 92.253(a) and (b) (tenant protections); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The participating jurisdiction must demonstrate in writing that such assistance meets the provisions of &sect;&sect;92.203,
92.210, 92.211, and 92.253(a) and (b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For affordable housing projects that are not HOME-assisted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) The contribution must be made with respect to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under &sect;92.252
or &sect;92.254. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The participating jurisdiction or its instrumentality must execute, with the owner of the housing (or, if the
participating jurisdiction is the owner, with the manager or developer), a written agreement that imposes and enumerates
all of the affordability requirements from &sect;92.252 and &sect;92.253(a) and (b) (tenant protections), or &sect;92.254,
whichever are applicable, the property standards requirements of &sect;92.251, and income determinations made
in accordance with &sect;92.203. This written agreement must be executed before any match contributions may be made.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A participating jurisdiction must establish a procedure to monitor these HOME match-eligible projects to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a cash contribution is recognized as
a matching contribution only if it is used for costs eligible under &sect;&sect;92.206 or 92.209, or for the following
costs (which are not eligible costs for HOME funds): The cost of removing and relocating an ECHO housing unit to accommodate
an eligible tenant, a project reserve account for replacements, a project reserve account for unanticipated increases
in operating costs, operating subsidies, or costs relating to the portion of a mixed-income or mixed-use HOME-assisted
project not related to the affordable housing units.

Except for contributions made to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds and bond proceeds to which
the provisions of &sect;92.220(a)(5) are applicable, to be a cash contribution, funds must be contributed permanently
to the HOME program, regardless of the form of investment the jurisdiction provides to a project. Therefore all repayment,
interest, or other return on investment of the contribution must be deposited in the local account of the participating
jurisdiction's HOME Investment Trust Fund to be used for eligible HOME activities in accordance with the requirements
of this part. A cash contribution to affordable housing that is not assisted with HOME funds must be contributed permanently
to the project. Repayments of matching contributions in affordable housing projects, as defined in &sect;92.219(b),
that are not HOME-assisted, must be made to the local account of the participating jurisdiction's HOME Investment
Trust Fund to get match credit for the full loan amount.

(2) The value, based on customary and reasonable means for establishing value, of State or local taxes, fees, or other
charges that are normally and customarily imposed or charged by a State or local government on all transactions or
projects in the conduct of State or local government operations but are waived, foregone, or deferred (including
State low-income housing tax credits) in a manner that achieves affordability of housing assisted with HOME funds.
Fees or charges that are associated with the HOME Program only (rather than normally and customarily imposed or charged
on all transactions or projects) are not eligible forms of matching contributions. The amount of any real estate taxes
may be based on post-improvement property value, using customary and reasonable means of establishing value. For
taxes, fees, or charges that are given for future years, the value is the present discounted cash value, based on a rate
equal to the rate for the Treasury security with a maturity closest to the number of years for which the taxes, fees,
or charges are waived, foregone, or deferred.

(i) Property not acquired with federal resources is a contribution in the amount of 100% of the value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Property that is acquired with federal assistance must be acquired specifically for HOME-assisted housing
or for affordable housing that will be counted as match pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;92.219(b)(2). Such property is a contribution in the amount of the difference between the acquisition cost
and the appraised value at the time of acquisition with the federal assistance, provided that the property is acquired
by the HOME project owner (or owner of the affordable housing that will be counted as match) with the federal assistance.
It also may be given to the HOME project owner (or owner of the affordable housing that will be counted as match) by the
entity acquiring the property with federal assistance or sold to the HOME project owner (or owner of the affordable
housing that will be counted as match) at a price equal to or less than the amount of the federal assistance used to acquire
the property. The acquisition cost paid with the federal assistance must be demonstrably below the appraised value
and must be acknowledged by the seller as a donation to affordable housing at the time of the acquisition with the federal
assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Property must be appraised in conformance with established and generally recognized appraisal practice and
procedures in common use by professional appraisers. Opinions of value must be based on the best available data properly
analyzed and interpreted. The appraisal of land and structures must be performed by an independent, certified appraiser.

State or local government, or an agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of a State, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Fifty percent of the loan amount made from bond proceeds to a multi-family affordable housing project owner may
qualify as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Twenty-five percent of the loan amount from bond proceeds made to a single-family affordable housing project
owner may qualify as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Loans made from bond proceeds may not constitute more than 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total
annual match contribution. Loans made from bond proceeds in excess of 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's
total annual match contribution may be carried over to subsequent fiscal years as excess match, but may not constitute
more than 25 percent of a participating jurisdiction's total annual match contribution in any one year.

(c) The participating jurisdiction that makes the match contributions to HOME-assisted or HOME match eligible projects
(match pursuant to &sect;92.219(b) for contributions to affordable housing, including tenant-based rental assistance,
that is not assisted with HOME funds) is the participating jurisdiction that receives the match credit. A State that
provides funding to a local participating jurisdiction to be used for a contribution to affordable housing, whether
or not HOME-assisted, may take the match credit for itself or may permit the local participating jurisdiction to receive
the match credit.

 (1) Changes in fair market rents and in median income over time should be sufficient to maintain the financial viability
of a project within the qualifying rent standards in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. Regardless of changes
in fair market rents and in median income over time, the qualifying rents are not required to be lower than the HOME rent
for the project in effect at the time of project commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) HUD may adjust the qualifying rents established for a project under paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section,
only if HUD finds that an adjustment is necessary to support the continued financial viability of the project and only
by an amount that HUD determines is necessary to maintain continued financial viability of the project. HUD expects
that this authority will be used sparingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Housing in a project that is designed in part for uses other than residential use qualifies as affordable housing if
such housing meets the criteria of &sect;92.252 or &sect;92.254. A project that contains, in addition to dwelling
units, laundry and community facilities for the exclusive use of the project residents and their guests, does not
constitute a project that is designed in part for uses other than residential use. Residential living space must constitute
at least 51 percent of the project space for contributions to the non-residential portion of the property to count
as match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. In subpart F, a new &sect;92.259 would be added to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of &sect;92.252 of this part apply to HOME-assisted ECHO units, except as specified in this section,
including the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only one ECHO unit may be provided per host property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The ECHO unit owner may choose whether or not to charge the tenant of the ECHO unit for rent, but if a rent is charged,
it must meet the requirements of &sect;92.252. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ECHO housing must remain affordable for the period specified in &sect;92.252(a)(5). If within the affordability
period the original occupant no longer occupies the unit, the ECHO unit owner must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Rent the unit to another eligible occupant on site; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Move the ECHO unit to another site for occupancy by an eligible occupant; or

* * * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Each participating jurisdiction must make reasonable efforts to identify community housing development organizations
that are capable, or can reasonably be expected to become capable, of carrying out elements of the jurisdiction's
approved housing strategy and to encourage such community housing development organizations to do so. If during
the first 24 months of its participation in the HOME Program a participating jurisdiction cannot identify a sufficient
number of capable CHDOs, up to 20 percent of the minimum CHDO setaside of 15 percent specified in paragraph (a) of this
section (but not more than $150,000 during the 24 month period) may be committed to develop the capacity of CHDOs in
the jurisdiction.

(e) If funds for operating expenses are provided under &sect;92.208 to a community housing development organization
that is not also receiving funds under paragraph (a) of this section for housing to be developed, sponsored or owned
by the community housing development organization, the participating jurisdiction must enter into a written agreement
with the community housing development organization that provides that the community housing development organization
is expected to receive funds under paragraph (a) of this section within 24 months of receiving the funds for operating
expenses, and specifies the terms and conditions upon which this expectation is based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A community housing development organization may not receive HOME funding for any fiscal year in an amount that provides
more than 50 percent or $50,000, whichever is greater, of the community housing development organization's total
operating expenses in that fiscal year. This includes organization support and housing education provided under
&sect;92.302 (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(6), as well as funds for operating expenses provided under &sect;92.208 and
administrative funds provided under &sect;92.207 (if the community housing development organization is a subrecipient
or contractor of the participating jurisdiction). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. In &sect;92.354, paragraph (a) is revised to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Every contract for the construction (rehabilitation or new construction) of housing that includes 12 or more
units assisted with HOME funds must contain a provision requiring the payment of not less than the wages prevailing
in the locality, as predetermined by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a&hyph;276a&hyph;5),
to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of any part of the housing. Such contracts must also be subject
to the overtime provisions, as applicable, of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327&hyph;332).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contract for construction must contain these wage provisions if HOME funds are used for any project costs (as
defined in &sect;92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more HOME-assisted
units. Where 12 or more units in a project are assisted under this part, the wage provisions must be contained in the
construction contract so as to apply to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project,
as defined in &sect;92.2, including portions other than the assisted units. If HOME funds are only used to assist first-time
homebuyers to acquire single-family housing and not for any other project costs, the wage provisions apply to the
construction of housing containing 12 or more units when there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of
the housing that the HOME funds will be used to assist first-time homebuyers to buy the housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Participating jurisdictions, contractors, subcontractors, and other participants must comply with regulations
issued under these Acts and with other federal laws and regulations pertaining to labor standards and HUD Handbook
1344.1 (Federal Labor Standards Compliance in Housing and Community Development Programs), as applicable. Participating
jurisdictions must require certification as to compliance with the provisions of this section before making any
payment under such contract.

(1) After the participating jurisdiction executes the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, complies with the
environmental requirements under part 58 of this title for release of funds, and submits the appropriate banking
and security documents, the participating jurisdiction may identify (set up) specific investments in the C/MI System.
Investments that require the set-up of projects in the C/MI System are the acquisition, new construction, or moderate
or substantial rehabilitation of real property, and investments of HOME funds to provide tenant-based rental assistance.
Within 12 calendar days of project set-up, the participating jurisdiction is required to submit a Project Set-Up
Report to HUD for each project set up in the C/MI System. Until an acceptable Project Set-Up Report is received and entered
in the C/MI System, HOME funds for the project are not considered committed to a specific project (as defined in &sect;92.2).

(1) Not less than annually, the participating jurisdiction must review the activities of owners of rental housing
assisted with HOME funds to assess compliance with the requirements of this part, as forth in the written agreement
under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For multi-family housing, each review must include on-site inspection
to determine compliance with housing codes and the requirements of this part. For rental projects containing 25 HOME-assisted
units or less, an on-site review must be made once within each two year period. The results of each review must be included
in the participating jurisdiction's performance report required by part 91 of this title and must be made available
to the public.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard is issuing regulations to require that all manned, oceangoing U.S. vessels 12.2 meters (approximately
40 feet) or more in length engaged in commerce and all manned fixed or floating platforms subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States keep records of garbage discharges and disposals. Regulations specifying the vessels and platforms
required to maintain these records are mandated by statute. The use of shipboard garbage discharge and disposal records
will promote compliance, facilitate enforcement, and reduce the amount of plastics discharged into the marine environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 20, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Recordkeeping of Refuse Discharges
From Ships'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 29482). The Coast Guard received 23 letters commenting on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and
one was not held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These statutory provisions had been addressed previously in a Coast Guard notice of proposed rulemaking (54 FR 37084;
September 6, 1989) but the regulatory section, as proposed, failed to receive OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction
Act and was deleted from the interim rule published on May 2, 1990 (55 FR 18578).

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987 (the Act) (Pub. L. 100&hyph;220) implements Annex V
of MARPOL 73/78. Section 2107 of the Act (33 U.S.C. 1903 (b)(2)(A)) requires that the Secretary of the Department in
which the Coast Guard is operating prescribe regulations which (a) require certain U.S. ``ships'' (defined in the
Act to include fixed or floating platforms, as well as vessels) to maintain refuse record books and (b) specify the
ships to which the regulations apply. Refuse record books will be used to document waste discharges from the ships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite implementation of other Coast Guard Annex V regulations to date, large amounts of plastic continue to wash
ashore, obstruct navigation, and entangle marine life. Very likely, much of this plastic was illegally discharged
as garbage from ships. According to the Coast Guard's ``MARPOL Reception Facility Study,'' an informal survey of
all Annex V reception facilities on the East and Gulf coasts, less than 20 percent of the vessels calling at these ports
off-load garbage at a reception facility. Yet, Coast Guard boarding officers frequently find no trace of garbage,
separated plastics, or incinerated ash on ships that doubtlessly generate large quantities of garbage, such as vessels
on long voyages. The evidence strongly suggests that, despite current regulations, large amounts of garbage are
still being discharged overboard before plastics are separated out for later disposal ashore or incineration aboard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though no regulation can stop a crew member intent on violating the regulation from illegally discharging garbage,
certain measures can be taken to reduce the number of intentional, as well as negligent, illegal discharges. Under
33 CFR 151.63(a), the master or person in charge of a ``ship'' is made personally responsible for all discharge or disposal
operations. Therefore, a requirement for the master or person in charge to maintain detailed records of each disposal
operation will promote knowledge of the discharge regulations and awareness of waste handling practices on the ship,
and provide a means of verifying that masters and persons in charge are carrying out their responsibilities. These
records will provide a more complete and accurate source of information for boarding officers than would the recollections,
over the duration of a voyage, of the master or person in charge. The Coast Guard has already identified the benefits
of records by stating in 33 CFR 151.63(b)(2) that log entries indicating discharge operations may be considered by
enforcement personnel in evaluating compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Coast Guard's ``MARPOL Reception Facility Study'' states that refuse recordkeeping is critical
to strengthening enforcement efforts. It is clear that the previous regulations have failed to curtail the growing
pollution problem. The waste management plans required by 33 CFR 151.57, which, it was hoped, would satisfy the statutory
mandate for a refuse record book, have in and of themselves produced inadequate results. It is now believed that, in
conjunction with waste management plans, refuse recordkeeping will measurably improve the management of refuse
aboard ships. In addition, it will provide data for evaluating this regulatory program and its effect on the environment.
Coast Guard boarding officers are noting with continued frequency that foreign vessels are maintaining refuse records
in order to demonstrate that they follow proper discharge procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this rulemaking, the Coast Guard is pursuing adoption of an international requirement for refuse recordkeeping
through the International Maritime Organization (IMO). In this regard, the Coast Guard submitted an action paper
at IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee meeting in July 1993.

Discussion of Comments and Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Three comments were in favor of the regulations. Of these three, one saw no problems with the rule and the other two
encouraged vigorous enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard intends to vigorously enforce these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment stated that the rule would have no effect on the discharge of garbage in the marine environment since
those who illegally dump would merely falsify records and continue the practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recording of waste disposal will aid in enforcement by identifying those ships that do not appear to have policies
and disposal methods that support the records they provide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment suggested that methods other than recordkeeping be used to reduce the amount of garbage in the marine
environment. Specifically, they proposed that plastic packaging materials be banned and replaced with biodegradable
materials, that ship operators be required to provide garbage handling personnel, and that on board waste processing
equipment be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These ideas may have merit and deserve future consideration. However, they are outside of the scope of this rulemaking,
which is limited to implementing 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) One comment stated that this recordkeeping should be required on the international level to avoid duplicative
national laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Though this idea may have merit, it is outside of the scope of this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Applicability (Section 151.55(a))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Coast Guard is in the process of converting measurements in many of its regulations to the metric system. Therefore,
&sect;151.55(a)(1) has been changed to refer to vessels of ``12.2 meters (approximately 40 feet).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Eleven comments were received from representatives of the offshore oil and gas industry indicating that regulations
on discharges already exist for fixed and floating platforms and that this additional requirement would be unnecessary
and redundant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Offshore platforms are made subject to the recordkeeping requirement in 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A)(i) because platforms
are included in the term ``ship'' as used in that provision. However, this rulemaking should have little effect on
platform operators as all discharges, except for ground victual waste beyond 12 nautical miles, are prohibited already
under 33 CFR 151.73.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment suggested that vessels or platforms discharging garbage to offshore supply vessels (OSV's) be required
to provide the OSV with records indicating the generator and amount of waste so that the OSV can make an accurate record
of waste it discharges ashore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The records required by this rule are for establishing compliance and maintaining a statistical record of garbage
discharged at sea. This will be done by inspections on the ships in question. Therefore, there is no justification
to put an additional burden on vessels and platforms by requiring them to provide OSV's with garbage records. Furthermore,
an OSV is not required under this rule to keep records of garbage it takes as cargo from another vessel or platform. The
word ``garbage'', as used throughout part 151, is defined in 33 CFR 151.05 as waste generated during the normal operation
of the ship. Garbage taken from a vessel or platform for shipment ashore is considered cargo on the OSV and is regulated
by the Shore Protection Act of 1988 (33 U.S.C. 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). It can not be mixed with the OSV's ship-generated garbage and disposed of at sea.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) One comment from an association representing a large segment of the passenger vessel industry recommended that
passenger vessels certificated for ocean service, though engaged exclusively in inland trade, not be required to
maintain refuse records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While these vessels usually discharge at shore reception facilities, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for
enforcement officials to determine that these vessels never operate outside of inland waters. However, &sect;151.55(c)(6)
has been changed to exclude garbage discharged to shore reception facilities from the requirement that garbage be
described by category. Shore discharges do not have the limitations as to contents as to discharges at sea. This change
significantly reduces the reporting burden for passenger, as well as other, vessels that discharge to shore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) One comment from a representative of the coastal towing industry stated that their vessels rarely operate outside
of 20 miles, have small crews, and are able to retain their garbage on board for shore disposal. Therefore, they should
be exempt from the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The capability of retaining garbage on board for disposal ashore is not sufficient justification to be exempted from
this rule. However, as with other vessels, if towing vessels retain their garbage on board for disposal to a shore reception
facility, they would be exempt from the requirements that they categorize their garbage under &sect;151.55(d)(6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Two comments stated that foreign ships were a major contributor to debris in the marine environment and should
be included in this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are limited by 33 U.S.C. 1903(b)(2)(A) to ships of United States registry or nationality or operated
under the authority of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) One comment stated that recreational vessels were a major cause of garbage in the marine environment and should
be included in this requirement.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the preamble of the proposed rule, the majority of recreational vessels do not operate outside of the
inland or coastal waters of the United States. They usually are engaged in voyages of short duration and do not generate
large amounts of garbage. Recreational vessels have a greater ability to retain garbage on board until returning
to port, where they usually have access to trash receptacles at the marina. Additionally, there is no requirement
for recreational vessels to maintain a log of any kind, making recordkeeping a greater burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) One comment stated that there is no evidence that vessels are the problem and that the major cause of garbage in the
water is sewage outflows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An increasing number of Coast Guard pollution cases clearly document a pattern of illegal garbage discharges from
vessels. This is confirmed each year by the beach cleanups conducted under the guidance of the Center for Marine Conservation.
While sewage outflows may be a significant cause of garbage in the marine environment, regulation of these outflows
is outside of the scope of this rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) One comment stated that public vessels are a major cause of garbage in the water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public vessels were not required to be in compliance with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of
1987 until December 31, 1993. Guidance has been, or will be, developed by the agencies responsible for these vessels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) One comment questioned why this rule applies to vessels of 40 feet or more, where the 1989 proposal applied to vessels
of 79 feet or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard lowered the size requirement in order to include classes of vessels that have been identified as possible
polluters in a study conducted by the Coast Guard and submitted to Congress on the implementation of MARPOL, Annex
V. This study, entitled ``Compliance with the Marine Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act of 1987'', was required
by that Act. There is further discussion of the 40 foot threshold in the preamble to the May 20, 1993, notice of proposed
rulemaking (58 FR 29483).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Information on Discharge or Disposal Operations (Section 151.55(c))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The MARPOL protocols request that the quantity of garbage disposed of at a shore reception facility be recorded
in cubic meters. Therefore, &sect;151.55(c)(5) has been changed to this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment stated that the requirement to log the distance to shore in addition to recording the latitude and longitude
was unnecessary. The comment stated that many vessels do not routinely keep track of the vessels's distance from shore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions in &sect;&sect;151.51 through 151.77 that specify where each type of garbage can be discharged are
based on the distance of the vessel from shore. Effective enforcement depends on knowing how far from shore a particular
type of garbage was discharged. However, recognizing that calculating the precise distance from shore using the
latitude and longitude is burdensome, the Coast Guard has changed &sect;151.55(c)(4) to allow the distance from
shore to be estimated. This alleviates the need for a specific calculation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) One comment recommended that the number of categories for recording of the contents of garbage be reduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Categories are necessary because the discharge regulations in &sect;&sect;151.51 through 151.77 are based on garbage
contents. However, upon review of the various regulations, it was determined that none of the regulations applicable
to vessels made a distinction between ground and unground victual waste. [Section 151.73 for platforms refers to
ground victual wastes, but this is the only category allowed to be discharged from a platform.] Therefore, &sect;151.55(c)(6)
has been changed to combine ground and unground victual waste into a single category. The word ``victual'' replaces
``food'', as used in the proposed rule, because it is a defined word used throughout part 151. [See &sect;151.05.]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) One comment stated that a single book should be developed to record the discharge of oil, noxious liquid substances,
and garbage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule allows ship operators to use such a book at their option. To require such a book is unnecessarily restrictive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Cost to Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) One comment stated that the estimate used in the draft Regulatory Evaluation of two minutes to sort garbage and
record its disposal was too short a time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two minute estimate was intended only to cover the recording of the disposal of garbage, not the sorting as well.
The sorting of garbage for disposal is an action that already must be undertaken to comply with the discharge restrictions
of &sect;&sect;151.51 through 151.77, regardless of whether or not a ship is required to record that disposal. Sorting
was not considered when determining the two minute estimate. Nevertheless, the Coast Guard has reevaluated the time
necessary to determine and record the amount and type of garbage being discharged and has found that five minutes per
entry is a more reasonable estimate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One comment was received from an association representing the towing industry stating that the Coast Guard's
estimate of the number of coastal towing boats that would be subject to this rule was incorrect. Rather than the number
23, as used in the draft Regulatory Evaluation, they stated that the correct number was closer to 350.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Evaluation has been changed accordingly. In preparing the draft Regulatory Evaluation, the wrong
number was inadvertently transposed and misstated. The Coast Guard agrees with the number provided by the comment.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It is not significant under the ``Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). A final Regulatory Evaluation
has been prepared and is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The following is a summary of the Evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total annual projected cost to industry of requiring that refuse records be maintained is estimated to be $12,370,915.54.
The increase in this total, as compared to that in the draft Regulatory Evaluation, is due to the increase in the estimated
recording time from two to five minutes. The total annual projected cost does not reflect the potential reduction
in reporting time for ships discharging at shore facilities or incinerating on board. In the final rule, ship operators
who discharge on shore or who incinerate on board no longer need to categorize the contents of their garbage. Nor does
the projected cost reflect the potential reduction in reporting time resulting from the deletion of the requirement
that the ship's distance from shore be precisely calculated. In the final rule, the distance may be estimated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard based the implementation costs of these regulations on the following categories of U.S. ships: freight
and tank vessels, tug and tow vessels, small fishing vessels (less than 300 gross tons), large fishing vessels (300
gross tons or more), passenger vessels, cruise vessels, vessels engaged in offshore oil and gas operations, research
and other miscellaneous classes of vessels, and manned fixed and floating platforms. The annual cost for a ship to
comply with these regulations was calculated by multiplying the time it would take to complete a refuse record entry
(five minutes), by the number of discharges per day (one), by the average wage per minute of the deck officer, chief
steward, or operator aboard each category of ship, and by the average number of discharges per year for each category
of ship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual cost per ship in each category is estimated to be: freight or tank vessel: $2,145.79; tug or tow vessel: $804.67;
small fishing vessel: $468.48; large fishing vessel: $585.21; passenger vessel: $804.67; cruise vessel: $6,437.37;
offshore oil or mineral vessel: $890.01; research or other miscellaneous class of vessel: $420.62; and manned fixed
or floating platform: $128.01.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimated numbers of vessels affected in each category are: 586 freight and tank vessels, 350 tug and tow vessels,
16,948 small fishing vessels, 224 large fishing vessels, 2,870 passenger vessels, 4 cruise vessels, 276 offshore
oil and mineral vessels, 124 research and other miscellaneous classes of vessels, and 1,000 manned fixed and floating
platforms.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total annual cost for each category of ship was calculated by multiplying annual cost per ship by the estimated
number of ships effected in each category: freight and tank vessels: $1,257,432.94; tug and tow vessels: $281,634.50;
small fishing vessels: $7,939,799.04; large fishing vessels: $131,087.04; passenger vessels: $2,309,402.90;
cruise vessels: $25,749.48; offshore oil and mineral vessels: $245,642.76; research and other miscellaneous classes
of vessels: $52,156.88; and manned fixed and floating platforms: $128,010.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average annual burden of this requirement per respondent is estimated to be 20.9 hours. This average was calculated
by dividing the total number of hours spent on recordkeeping annually, by the total number of applicable ships.

Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard does not have accurate information on how many vessels or manned fixed or floating platforms would
qualify as small entities and what the economic impact on them would be. However, because the recordkeeping is expected
to require only five minutes per day and no particular record book or format is prescribed, the Coast Guard certifies
under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Collection of Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains a collection of information requirement. The Coast Guard has submitted the requirements to the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and OMB has approved them. The section number is &sect;151.55 and the corresponding OMB approval number is OMB Control
Number 2115&hyph;0613.

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has
determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant
Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. The regulations
are administrative in nature and are expected to have some positive but no negative impact on the environment. The
regulations should contribute to the reduction of the occurrence of plastic, as well as other ship-generated garbage,
in the marine environment. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for inspection or copying
where indicated under

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board proposes to amend its Practices and Procedures for Appeals and Stay Requests of Personnel Actions Allegedly
Based on Whistleblowing. This amendment extends the time limit for filing an appeal of an agency action where the appellant
first files a request for a stay of that action. This proposed change will bring the filing time in initial whistleblower
cases into line with filing times in the Board's appellate jurisdiction cases and will also have the effect of making
the Board's appellate processes more accessible to Federal employees.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change came about as a result of Executive Order 12866, September 30, 1993, requiring agencies to insure
that regulations are effective, consistent, sensible, and understandable. The Board's review found that changing
the time limit for filing initial appeals to its regional offices would be consistent with the legal and regulatory
time limits for filing with the Federal courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission both of which can potentially
review final decisions of the Board. The consistency created by this proposed change will help to eliminate possible
confusion by Federal employees who file appeals with the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this proposed regulatory action is not ``significant'' as defined by Executive Order
12866, and therefore, is not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has also determined that this proposed regulatory action does not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612).

Many corporate credit unions are closely tied to credit union leagues or trade associations through interlocking
boards of directors or common management. The NCUA Board requests comment on whether to amend its regulations to require
that a corporate credit union's board of directors be independently elected by its members, that the board represent
primarily the interests of those members that are credit unions, and that management report only to the corporate
credit union's board of directors.

A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The corporate credit union system today consists of 44 corporate credit unions serving the nation's 13,000 natural
person credit unions, with U.S. Central Credit Union in turn serving the corporate credit unions. The corporate credit
union system provides liquidity, investment, and payment services to credit unions. As of December 31, 1993, the
44 corporate credit unions held about $41 billion in assets, half of which was reinvested in shares in U.S. Central.
Approximately half of the corporate credit unions are closely tied to state credit union leagues, either through
interlocking boards, management relationships, or both. In the case of U.S. Central, six of nine board seats are allotted
to trade association representatives: three to the Credit Union National Association (CUNA), two to the Association
of Credit Union League Executives, and one to the Kansas Credit Union Association. In addition, U.S. Central's CEO
reports to the CEO of CUNA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed below, the NCUA Board is requesting comment on whether a corporate credit union's board
of directors should be independently elected by its members, primarily represent the interests of the corporate's
member credit unions, and have sole authority over the management of the corporate credit union. These and other corporate
credit union issues, including investment powers and capital levels, are currently under review by NCUA as part of
a 180-day study of the corporate system, and the Board may propose specific regulatory changes at the completion of
the study.

B. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The history of the ties between corporate credit unions and trade associations is a long and, for the most part, successful
one. It stems from the credit union movement's long struggle for a national solution to its liquidity problems. A review
of these efforts is essential in understanding how the present system, with its unusual combination of private and
government entities, was established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original draft of the 1934 Federal Credit Union Act contained a section for a central bank for credit unions. It
was dropped in exchange for a grant of authority for federal credit unions to make deposits in, and to borrow from, federal
reserve banks. Opposition from the Federal Reserve System led to the striking of this authority. Federal credit unions
were led to believe that, as a compromise, they would be included in the upcoming legislation to create the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). When the legislation was adopted, however, credit unions were not included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1940's, credit unions experienced a number of liquidity problems, especially during the war years of 1941&hyph;1945.
In response, the first corporate credit union was organized by credit union leaders in Kansas in 1951. Also in 1951,
the credit union movement secured the introduction of a bill for a national central bank and seven regional banks,
but Congress failed to address the issue. In the late 1950's, several bills were considered by Congress for the chartering
of central credit unions which could accept the deposits of federal credit unions. None of these was adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forced to address liquidity problems on their own, credit union leagues began to establish additional state-chartered
corporate credit unions. League officials lent their expertise in helping to start these corporate credit unions
and serving on their boards.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Following severe liquidity problems in 1966 and 1969, the credit union movement again petitioned Congress for a central
bank. Congressman Wright Patman (D&hyph;TX) introduced a bill to create a national credit union bank in 1971, but
did not secure enactment. He tried again in 1973, once more unsuccessfully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Realizing that credit union system liquidity and investment needs would continue to be addressed in the private sector,
CUNA worked to establish a central institution to serve corporate credit unions, securing a charter for U.S. Central
Credit Union from the State of Kansas in 1974. In 1980, legislation was passed enabling U.S. Central and the other corporate
credit unions to be designated as ``bankers banks,'' with access to the Federal Reserve System. By the early 1980's,
most states had established corporate credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The financial reform bills of the early to mid-1970's advanced the concept of a central liquidity facility for credit
unions, rather than a central bank. The credit union movement eventually supported the establishment of such a facility
to serve as a backup for the private system. The Central Liquidity Facility (CLF) was officially established November
1978 and continues in its role of providing a government-operated source of liquidity for the credit union system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The credit union movement must be acknowledged for successfully establishing a private system which has met the liquidity
needs of credit unions and provided services in the areas of investments, securities safekeeping, payment systems,
and correspondent services. This corporate credit union system, while encountering some problems, has nevertheless
done an admirable job of meeting the needs of credit unions over an extended period of time.

C. Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The history of NCUA's regulatory efforts in this area reflects its concern regarding the control and direction of
corporate credit unions. Until 1979, only natural person members of a corporate credit union were permitted to serve
on the board of directors. In 1979 the NCUA Board issued a final rule permitting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
member credit unions 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to appoint representatives to the corporate credit union. See 44 FR 58496, Oct. 10, 1979. A representative was empowered
to attend meetings, vote, and stand for election on behalf of the member credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1980 the Board issued Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement (IRPS) 80&hyph;3, which clarified that although

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
other non-natural person members 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of corporate credit unions were entitled to vote through agents, such agents could not stand for election in place
of the non-natural person member and were not eligible to serve in any elective or appointive capacity in the corporate
credit union. 45 FR 14202, Mar. 5, 1980.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1983 the Board adopted the standard corporate federal credit union (FCU) bylaws. Article XV, Section 2, addresses
conflicts of interest of officials and employees and is identical to Article XIX, Section 4, of the standard FCU bylaws
for natural person FCUs. It provides, in relevant part:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No director, committee member, officer, agent, or employee of this credit union shall in any manner, directly or indirectly,
participate in the deliberation upon or the determination of any question affecting his/her pecuniary interest
or the pecuniary interest of any corporation, partnership, or association (other than this credit union) in which
he/she is directly or indirectly interested.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to concerns about the implications for a corporate credit union official who is the designated representative
of a member credit union acting upon matters which may affect that credit union, the Board noted that the provision
was not intended to preclude an official from participating in the establishment of policy and general direction
of the corporate credit union. The Board stated that it was intended to preclude an official from taking part in actions
which would represent a true conflict of interest in a meaningful sense pertaining to his or her credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984 the Board issued a final rule permitting all non-natural person members of corporate credit unions to designate
representatives to stand for election and hold elective and appointive office. 49 FR 50368, Dec. 28, 1984. In the preamble
to the proposed rule, the Board stated that the restrictions of the regulation and IRPS 80&hyph;3 were at variance
with the underlying philosophy of one-member-one-vote. 49 FR 17953, Apr. 26, 1984. In the preamble to the final rule,
the Board stated that because corporate credit unions must primarily serve other credit unions, the credit union
members would continue to influence the direction, policy, and priorities of the corporates through the democratic
process. The Board also acted to officially repeal IRPS 80&hyph;3, stating that it addressed matters that were either
superseded by or incorporated in the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over time, a limited number of corporate credit unions developed financial problems resulting in part from poor quality,
preferential loans made to affiliated leagues, less than arms-length transactions involving the purchase or lease
of league's fixed assets, and the payment of other league expenses. These incidents occurred in corporates that were
closely tied to leagues at either the board or management level. In response, the NCUA Board issued a proposed rule
in 1991 requiring that at least three members of the corporate credit union board be individuals who were independent
of any organization with which the corporate credit union was associated, excluding member credit unions. See 56
FR 11952, Mar. 21, 1991. The Board noted that many corporate credit unions shared physical space, personnel, and officials
with other organizations, often leagues and service organizations, creating an environment in which conflicts
of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could develop. The proposed rule also contained a recusal
provision identical to Article XV, Section 2, of the standard corporate FCU bylaws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, issued on May 7, 1992, see 57 FR 22626, May 28, 1992, gave corporate credit unions an option with regard
to board representation. Section 704.12(a) states that the board of directors of a corporate credit union is determined
as stipulated in the corporate credit union's bylaws, provided that: (1) At least three directors are not officers,
directors, or employees of an affiliated organization; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) elections are open and independent, with procedures for nominations by petition and mail balloting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed recusal provision was also changed. Section 704.12(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
requires recusal 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for matters involving 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
personal pecuniary interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For matters involving the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pecuniary interest of an entity 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in which an official or employee is interested, Section 704.12(c)(2) requires recusal only when the amount in question
exceeds 5 percent of the corporate credit union's capital, when measured annually as an aggregate of business arrangements
with the entity. The conflict faced by corporate FCUs, between the new recusal provision and the bylaws, was not addressed.

D. Re-examining the System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the new regulations have resulted in greater independence of corporate credit unions, the leagues and trade
associations still wield considerable influence in some institutions. A number of factors have led the Board to consider
whether additional steps should be taken to ensure that boards of directors and management of corporate credit unions
operate independently of credit union trade associations and represent the interests of the corporate's member
credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One important factor is the dramatic increase in the scrutiny of financial institutions by the public, the press,
and Congress as a result of the savings and loan disaster. A primary example of this scrutiny is the exhaustive General
Accounting Office study of credit unions. This 371-page report was the longest and most detailed of any financial
institution sector and was done at a time when the credit union movement was recording record growth, record health,
and was experiencing no identifiable problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This atmosphere of intense scrutiny, while fully understandable, means that measures must be taken to ensure that
safety and soundness, and the perception of safety and soundness, are maintained at the highest possible level. Public
confidence in the financial system is based, after all, more on public perception than on an intimate knowledge of
the workings of the system. The crash of the savings and loan industry and temporary problems at the FDIC have increased
public scrutiny and mistrust of the financial services industry. In this atmosphere, it is essential that credit
union members and the public be assured that corporate credit union decision makers act only with the interests of
the corporate credit union's members in mind.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second factor is a function of credit union growth. The asset level of corporate credit unions is almost as high
as that of the entire credit union movement when the CLF was created. The magnitude of the asset growth within the corporate
system attracts outside attention and warrants continuous re-examination for possible weaknesses and/or areas
of improvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, as previously mentioned, the interrelationships between corporate credit unions and state trade associations
have in some cases led to the misuse of corporate credit unions' resources to address budgetary or financial constraints
in the trade associations. The NCUA Board is concerned that such conflicts, or even the appearance of conflicts in
these areas, may threaten the survival of a strong and independent credit union system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the recent publicity concerning U.S. Central's foreign investments has focused considerable attention
to the corporate credit union system. The Board is concerned that if the system is perceived as having areas of potential
conflict, Congress will introduce legislative proposals to address them. As mentioned earlier, the Board has undertaken
a study of the corporate credit union system which should allay these concerns if they are unfounded. If changes are
needed, however, the Board believes it is preferable to address them by regulation, rather than await Congressional
action over which NCUA and credit unions may have little or no control.

Election of Directors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In consideration of the above factors, the Board requests comment on changes to NCUA's regulation of corporate credit
unions, 12 CFR Part 704, to require that the board of directors of a corporate credit union be independently elected
by its members, with the condition that at least a majority of the board seats be held by representatives of member credit
unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that in many instances interlocks exists as a result of the same representative(s) being separately
elected to both the corporate credit union board of directors and the board of a league or other association, the NCUA
Board also requests comment on whether it should establish a requirement that all or a majority of the corporate board
be comprised of representatives who do not serve in dual capacities other than as officials of both the corporate and
a member credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board requests comments on other issues related to how best to accomplish majority representation by credit unions.
For example, elections could be open, with unrestricted nominations. However, once the maximum number of seats permitted
to representatives of non-credit union members was filled, the remaining seats would go to credit union representatives,
even if a non-credit union representative received more votes. As an alternative, the Board could revise the regulations
to revert to the limitations of IRPS 80&hyph;3, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that non-credit union members have full voting rights but are not eligible to hold seats or place representatives
on the board of directors. The Board seeks comments on these and other methods to assure a corporate credit union's
board is representative primarily of the interests of the corporate's member credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is aware that this is a departure from the democratic ideal of equal rights for all members, but believes for
the reasons described above, that it may be in the best interests of credit unions. As the history of part 704 shows,
the rights of various types of corporate credit union members frequently have differed, as the role of corporate credit
unions has evolved over the years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of U.S. Central Credit Union, the Board has some concern that majority representation by its member credit
unions may not be the best solution. While U.S. Central serves other corporate credit unions, it ultimately has great
responsibilities, because of its central and national role, to natural person credit unions and credit union members.
The Board requests comment on whether classes of directors should be established at U.S. Central in order to ensure
representation by natural person credit unions and others broadly representative of the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-natural Person Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board also seeks comment on whether election or appointment of a non-natural person member representative to
a position in a corporate credit union should be considered to be an election or appointment of the individual or the
non-natural person member. In IRPS 80&hyph;3 the Board took the position that election or appointment was of the individual,
not the non-natural person member. The Board stated that while the board of directors of a member credit union (at that
time the only non-natural person member permitted to designate a representative to stand for election) was free to
change its designated representative at any time, where that representative had been elected to the corporate credit
union's board of directors or elected or appointed to a committee, revocation of the designation meant that any position
held by that individual must be declared vacant. Such vacancies were to be filled in accordance with the Article VII,
Section 3, of the FCU bylaws (the corporate FCU bylaws had not yet been issued), which provides that vacancies on the
board, credit committee, or supervisory committee shall be filled by vote of a majority of the directors then holding
office. The member credit union's new representative did not automatically assume the old representative's elected
or appointed position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, IRPS 80&hyph;3 was repealed in the 1984 revision to the regulation. However, there was no discussion
of NCUA's position on filling a position when a non-natural person member's designated can no longer serve or the non-natural
person member wishes to change its designate. Subsequently, NCUA informally took the position that it was a matter
to be determined by each corporate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board notes that there are sound arguments for each position. In IRPS 80&hyph;3, it was observed that where the
designated representative of a non-natural member has been elected or appointed to a position in the corporate credit
union, the voters or appointing official were, at least in part, swayed by the qualifications of the individual. It
was reasoned that to permit the board of directors of the non-natural person member to substitute another individual
in the place of a representative who has been elected or appointed to an office defeats the purpose of an election in
the one case and usurps the power of the appointing official in the other. On the other hand, it is the non-natural person
entity that is the actual member of the corporate credit union, not the representative, so it can be argued that it is
the non-natural person member that holds the elected or appointed position. As such the member should have the right
to determine who serves as its representative. The Board seeks comment on whether all corporates should be required
to take the same approach to non-natural person members and which approach is preferable.

Recusal Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring that a majority of the board of directors of a corporate credit union, but not all, be representatives of
member credit unions means that some board members may be either representatives of other non-natural person members,
such as leagues and service organizations, or natural person members with ties to such entities. Also, depending
on the Board's ultimate decision on the issue, individual representatives of member credit unions may, in some cases,
continue to serve on the corporate board and, at the same time, serve on the board of a league or other association. Finally,
conflicts will continue to arise when matters come before the board of a corporate credit union that directly involve
a member credit union whose representative serves on the board. Accordingly, the NCUA Board believes that to avoid
even the appearance of a conflict of interest, it is important to have a strong recusal provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these concerns, the Board is considering returning to the language of Article XV, Section 2, of the standard
corporate FCU bylaws, which prohibits directors, committee members, officers, agents, or employees of corporate
credit unions from participation in any question affecting the pecuniary interest of any organization in which those
individuals are interested. Adopting this language would resolve the conflict, for corporate FCUs, between the
bylaw and the regulation, and would make the standard uniform for all corporate credit unions. The Board seeks comment
on this idea and on the appropriate definition of ``interested.''

Management Accountability

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, as previously mentioned, the NCUA Board is concerned about situations in which management of a corporate
credit union reports to the officials of an affiliated league or trade association. For corporate FCUs, this may violate
several provisions of the standard corporate FCU bylaws. Article VI, Section 5, provides that the board shall have
the general direction and control of the affairs of the credit union. The bylaw states that the board may delegate the
performance of administrative duties but is not relieved of its responsibility for their performance. Article VII,
Section 6, provides that the board may employ a management official who shall not be a member of the board and who shall
be under the direction and control of the board. Although the Board cannot speak to the bylaws of state-chartered corporate
credit unions, the practice of the management of one entity reporting to officials of another entity violates fundamental
principles of general corporate law. Accordingly, the Board is considering amending its regulations to require
that management of a corporate credit union report solely to the board of directors of that credit union.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board welcomes comment on these and any other considerations with respect to the management and control of corporate
credit unions.

F. Effect on State-Chartered Corporate Credit Unions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 704 applies to all federally insured corporate credit unions. Further, non-federally insured corporate credit
union must agree to comply with NCUA's corporate credit union regulation as a condition of receiving funds from natural
person FCUs. Thus, the regulatory changes will affect all corporate credit unions. The Board believes this result
is essential, given that the vast majority of funds held in the corporate system represent investments by federally
insured credit unions.

The Proposal

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to alter VOR Federal
Airways V&hyph;172 and V&hyph;177 located in Wisconsin and Illinois. To expedite the flow of traffic, direct routings
are desirable for aircraft arriving at satellite airports in the Chicago metropolitan area. V&hyph;172 would be
realigned from the newly relocated ELGIN, IL, intersection direct to the Du Page, IL, (DPA) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional
Range/Distance Measuring Equipment facility. V&hyph;177, heading southeast from the Janesville, WI, (JVL) Very
High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility toward the Joliet, IL, (JOT) VORTAC
currently doglegs over the Rockford, IL, (RFD) VORTAC. Realigning V&hyph;177 would provide a direct route between
the Janesville and Joliet VORTACs and eliminate the dogleg over the Rockford VORTAC. Domestic VOR Federal airways
are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which
is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airways listed in this document would be
published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reopening to May 4, 1994, the comment period on the notice of proposed rulemaking
pertaining to combinations of over-the-counter (OTC) internal analgesic and antacid ingredients, specifically
sodium bicarbonate used as an antacid active ingredient (February 2, 1994, 59 FR 5068). FDA is taking this action in
response to a request to extend the comment period for an additional 30 days to allow more time to comment on this proposal.
The comment period for these issues closed on April 4, 1994. This proposal is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products
conducted by FDA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 2, 1994 (59 FR 5068), FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the tentative final monograph
for OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products (hereinafter referred to as the February
1994, proposal). This proposal affected combinations of internal analgesic and antacid ingredients, specifically
sodium bicarbonate used as an antacid active ingredient. As proposed, combination drug products intended to be dissolved
in liquid prior to administration, such as powders and effervescent granules or tablets, would not be allowed to make
a claim for ``relief of overindulgence in food and drink'' or a claim for ``relief of hangover.'' FDA issued the February
1994, proposal after receiving reports of gastric (stomach) rupture following ingestion of sodium bicarbonate
to relieve gastrointestinal distress. Interested persons were given until April 4, 1994, to submit comments on the
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 28, 1994, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (NDMA), a trade association representing
the manufacturers and distributors of OTC medicines, requested that the comment period be extended for at least 30
days. NDMA stated that the extension is necessary to provide sufficient time to develop comprehensive comments to
submit to the agency. NDMA explained that most companies that distribute OTC drug products containing sodium bicarbonate
as an active ingredient were not anticipating changes in the internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic
tentative final monograph and the February 1994, proposal provided the first opportunity for many affected parties
to become aware of the agency's concerns and intentions for amending the tentative final monograph. NDMA stated that
interested parties have had insufficient time to acquire the reference materials cited by FDA, to retrieve relevant
product experience reports, and to research thoroughly the issues raised in FDA's February 1994, proposal. NDMA
also mentioned that the time period for the comments includes several days on which many company employees will not
be working because of religious holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has carefully considered the request and believes that this additional time for comment is in the public interest.
Accordingly, the comment period is reopened to May 4, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before May 4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding OTC internal analgesic, antipyretic, and antirheumatic drug products containing sodium bicarbonate
as an antacid active ingredient. Three copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is developing a regulation requiring employers to certify abatement and submit abatement plans and progress
reports as a result of OSHA citations. In addition, OSHA is proposing the placement of a tag on cited equipment to alert
affected employees that a hazardous condition exists while abatement is being accomplished. Violation of the regulation
would result in civil penalties as prescribed by section 17 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. This
notice invites interested parties to submit comments and recommendations on the issues detailed in this document,
as well as other pertinent issues. All the information received in response to this notice will be carefully reviewed.
The comments received will assist OSHA in developing the final regulation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposed rule is to require employers to inform OSHA and their employees about measures they will
take or have taken in response to OSHA citations, as well as to inform employees about OSHA citations and the alleged
safety or health hazards described therein.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (i.e., ``the Act'' or ``the OSH Act''), 29 U.S.C. 651 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et. seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, OSHA inspects workplaces to determine whether employers are complying with OSHA standards and other statutory
or regulatory requirements. If OSHA believes that an employer has committed a violation, a citation is issued. The
citation will reference the requirement allegedly violated, the alleged violation, and note the proposed penalty
and a date by which the violation is to be corrected, i.e., the abatement date. Section 9(a), 29 U.S.C. 658(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the cover letter to the employer which accompanies an OSHA citation states that the employer must notify
the Area Director promptly by letter of abatement of violations. (OSHA Instruction ADM 1&hyph;1.12A CH&hyph;7,
August 3, 1987. ``IMIS FORMS Manual'', Appendix C, page C&hyph;22). No specific regulation, however, authorizes
this notification action. When, therefore, an employer does not provide written verification of abatement, OSHA
may, depending on the circumstances, seek to verify abatement by making further efforts to communicate with the employer
(e.g., by telephone), or by conducting an on-site follow-up inspection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 1991, the General Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report to Congress in which it assessed the adequacy of OSHA's
policies and procedures for determining whether hazards have been abated. The report (GAO/HRD&hyph;91&hyph;35)
(Ex. 1)
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 found that these policies and procedures have limitations that impede the Agency's ability to detect employers who
have failed to abate the safety and health hazards for which they have been cited. GAO found that OSHA's policies: (1)
Do not require, but merely request, employers to provide evidence of abatement, and (2) inadequately address confirmation
of hazard abatements found at construction worksites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The GAO report concluded that OSHA would obtain improved evidence of abatement if its regulations required employers
to provide specific documentation that they have abated hazards. The report further concluded that such a requirement
would enhance OSHA's ability to detect noncomplying employers and determine where to conduct follow-up inspections.
Employers also would be more likely to abate hazards because they would have to provide specific evidence of abatement.
Accordingly, GAO recommended that OSHA promulgate a regulation requiring employers to submit detailed evidence
of what corrective actions have been taken to abate hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GAO was also concerned about hazard abatement problems in the construction industry due to the mobility of hazardous
equipment. The report's conclusion stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA needs to confirm abatement of construction hazards in such a way that they will not be repeated at subsequent worksites.
OSHA's practice of accepting worksite closing as a form of abatement allows the continuation of procedures and practices
that perpetuate hazardous conditions. Consequently, contractors can continue to use a defective piece of equipment,
untrained employees, or inadequate procedures and processes at subsequent worksites. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA should require contractors to take abatement actions that will correct what caused the hazard rather than just
eliminate the hazard at the inspection site.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (emphasis added) (GAO/HRD&hyph;91&hyph;35)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second GAO recommendation was for OSHA to revise its polices so that (1) citations to employers at construction
worksites require correcting the condition, equipment, or procedure that create the hazard, and (2) employers will
not be able to ``abate'' hazards solely by moving to another location.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not referenced in the GAO report, unsuspecting employees may be exposed to similar hazards under conditions
in which the place of employment and equipment are permanent, but there is a frequent turnover of employees in temporary
jobs or employees are rotated frequently through different job assignments. Also, workers in mobile crews who visit
different job sites should have available hazard warning information regarding defective equipment which they
must operate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current OSHA policy is that written, detailed plans of abatement shall be submitted to the Area Director when citations
are issued alleging (i.e. noise or air contaminant) violations and OSHA orders that engineering or administrative
controls be implemented. In these cases, employers are also asked to submit progress reports, generally every ninety
days, detailing steps taken to achieve complete abatement (e.g., procurement of engineering controls). Field Operations
Manual, chapter V (appendix), E.4.a. and c., E.5.a. and c. (Ex. 2) OSHA's policy, therefore is to have employers verify
that the violation cited has been corrected. Despite this policy, there is no existing regulation, enforceable by
citations and civil penalties, which mandates employers to submit abatement plans, progress reports, or abatement
verification letters. Thus, OSHA proposes that employers should be required by regulation to submit such documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 29 CFR 1903.16 requires the posting of a citation at or near the place of the alleged violation. This regulation
is inadequate in many instances to notify employees that OSHA has required the abatement of hazardous conditions
because citations are often posted on company bulletin boards that employees may not see or read. Employees are more
likely, therefore, to be informed about hazardous equipment they are operating via a required tag affixed to that
equipment than by a posted citation. OSHA already requires that employers in general industry and construction affix
accident-prevention tags informing employees about hazardous conditions. 29 CFR 1910.145(f) and 1926.200(h).
However, these standards do not require employers to state that a condition has been cited. Further, the General Industry
standard does not apply to construction, maritime, or agricultural employers. 29 CFR 1910.145 (f)(1)(ii). Therefore,
OSHA also proposes that all employers covered by the OSH Act be required to affix tags to cited equipment informing
employees about an OSHA citation regarding that equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the proposed rule, there are two key terms, i.e., ``abatement date'' and ``final order.'' The following
discussion is provided in order to relate these terms to the statutory framework created by the OSH Act. The discussion,
however, is general in nature and is not intended to address every situation that may arise in the course of litigation.

Contesting a Citation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, an employer has the right, under the OSH Act, to contest a citation or a prescribed abatement date. (employers
may also contest only the amount of the penalty proposed for a violation, but this action does not delay the abatement
period prescribed for that violation). An abatement date can also be contested by an affected employee or a representative
of affected employees. If neither the employer nor employees contest the citation, the date set forth in the citation
for the correction of the violation is the abatement date.

The Act provides that an employer may file a notice of contest within fifteen working days of receiving the notification
of proposed penalty. Section 10, 29 U.S.C. 659. (Under current OSHA practice, the notification of proposed penalty
is attached to the citation.) Appellate courts have held that OSHA may set an abatement date which falls within the
fifteen-day period, in which case the period allowed for contest is shortened accordingly. See

The Act also provides that, in the event of a contest, the employer's obligation to abate a cited violation is suspended,
provided that the employer's contest has been made ``*&blank;*&blank;* in good faith and not solely for purposes
of delay or avoidance of penalties.'' Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 659(b). Once a citation is contested, an employer's
abatement obligation generally does not start to run until a ``final order'' has been issued ending the administrative
phase of the litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a citation or a prescribed abatement period has been contested, the matter is adjudicated by the Occupational
Safety and Health Review Commission (i.e., ``the Commission''), an independent agency headed by three Presidential
appointees (i.e., ``Members''). Initially, a contested case is usually heard by an administrative law judge (ALJ)
of the Commission. The ALJ issues a decision and order, which are then docketed with the Commission. This decision
and order may subsequently be reviewed by the full Commission. Section 12(j), 29 U.S.C. 659(j). Under this review
procedure, any Member of the Commission may direct review of the ALJ's decision and order within thirty days of the
docketing date. If there is no direction for review, the ALJ's decision and order becomes the final order of the Commission.

 Any abatement requirement affirmed or modified by an ALJ's decision and order will start to run on the date that the
ALJ's decision and order become a final order. The new abatement date is determined by adding to the final order date
either: (1) The number of days allowed originally for abatement in the citation (in cases where the ALJ affirms the
abatement requirement) or (2) the newly specified period for abatement (in cases where the ALJ modifies the abatement
requirement). If, However, the Commission reviews an ALJ's decision and order, the employer's abatement obligation
remains suspended during the review process. Following its review, the Commission will generally issue its own decision,
which becomes a final order thirty days after its decision is issued. Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C. 659(c).

 Again, any abatement period affirmed or modified as a result of the Commission's decision will start to run from the

An ALJ's decision and order that have not been directed for Commission review, or a decision of the Commission following
such review, also may be challenged in the appropriate federal appellate court. Sections 11(a) and (b), 29 U.S.C.
660(a) and (b). Filing a petition for appellate court review does not automatically stay the employer's abatement
requirements.

 In extraordinary cases, however, either the Commission or the court of appeals may stay the final order at the employer's
request. If stayed, the abatement requirement does not begin to run until the appellate court upholds the earlier
decision of the Commission or the ALJ (i.e., to affirms or revise the abatement requirement) by issuing a mandate or
an equivalent order giving legal effect to the appellate court's decision. Where a citation was vacated by the Commission
or the ALJ, and the appellate court subsequently reverses that decision, the appellate court will generally remand
the case to the Commission for entry of an order to affirm the citation. The abatement requirement then will begin to
run thirty days after the date of the appellate court's order. Should the appellate court, in such cases, not remand
the case for entry of a Commission order, the abatement obligation begins to run from the court's own entry of mandate
or equivalent order.

Settlement or withdrawal of a contest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At any stage of an ongoing contest proceeding, there may be a settlement of the case, in whole or in part, or the employer
may unilaterally withdraw the notice of contest, in whole or in part. Under these conditions, the ALJ or the Commission
will enter an order based on the settlement or withdrawal of the notice of contest. It is OSHA's legal position that,
in some circumstances, withdrawal or settlement actions by employers become final orders by operation of law upon
execution, without approval by the Commission. (See

United Transportation Union, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
474 U.S. 3 (1985)). However, for purposes of determining the timing of an employer's abatement obligations under
the proposed regulation, OSHA has elected to treat orders based on settlement or withdrawal in the same manner as other
ALJ and Commission orders, i.e., the abatement obligation begins to run thirty days after the docketing of the ALJ
order by the Commission or after the issuance of the Commission order, as the case may be. Should the parties phrase
the settlement agreement such that abatement is called for by a date certain, or that the abatement period will run
from a certain event (e.g., the date of execution of the agreement), the abatement date will be determined in accordance
with the terms of the agreement provided no employee or employee representative contests the abatement period specified
in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of a Commission final order has a number of consequences for enforcement. If OSHA determines that an
employer has failed to correct a violation on or before the expiration of the abatement date, OSHA may issue a notification
of failure to abate. Section 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 659(b). A penalty of up to $7000 may be assessed for each day the failure
to abate continues. Section 17(d), 29 U.S.C. 666(d). If, after a final order, the employer commits a substantially
similar violation in a different location, or with a different piece of equipment, or with the same piece of equipment
after a period of temporary abatement, the violation is classified as repeated and a penalty of up to $70,000 may be
assessed. Section 17 (a), 29 U.S.C. 666(a). Further, the Secretary may file a petition for enforcement of a Commission
order which has became final after a notice of contest, or after a failure to contest within fifteen working days. This
petition is filed in the court of appeals and the court issues a decree enforcing the Commission final order. If the
employer violates this decree, the employer may be subject to penalties for contempt of court. Section 11(b), 29 U.S.C.
660(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion above details the regular procedures for obtaining and enforcing final Commission orders with their
concomitant abatement dates. In addition, there are procedures for modifying the abatement requirements of a citation
due to employer hardship. Upon a showing by an employer of inability to complete abatement within the prescribed period
because of factors beyond the employer's reasonable control, the employer may obtain a modification of the abatement
date. Section 10(c), 29 U.S.C. 659(c). A petition for modification of abatement date (PMA) must be filed no later than
the close of the next working day following the date on which abatement is required. If neither OSHA nor affected employees
object to the employer's request, OSHA may approve the PMA and it then becomes a final order pursuant to section 10(a)
and (c) of the Act. If either OSHA or employees object to the PMA, the case is forwarded to the Commission for adjudication.
See 29 CFR 2200.37. The Commission may either accept, reject, or modify the employer's request for additional time
and issue an appropriate order.

II. Summary and Explanation of the Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed regulation, an employer who has received an OSHA citation must submit to the OSHA Area Director
an abatement certificate, which states whether or not the violation has been abated, as documentation of abatement.
The proposed regulation would also require an employer who has received an OSHA citation to submit an abatement plan,
where the Area Director requests one by such means as a note on the citation, which sets forth a schedule for the implementation
of abatement measures. Under the proposal the employer would also submit progress reports, which explain what measures
have been taken, if any, in the process of achieving abatement, when the Area Director requires them. The proposed
rule would also require employers to affix tags on equipment noting that a citation has been issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a), Scope and Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation applies to all industries covered by the OSH Act, including general industry, construction, maritime,
and agricultural employers. The specific identification of the major industrial groups, in this section, is intended
to make this fact clear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (b), Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only those terms of the definitions paragraph which were felt to need further clarification are included in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abatement date.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The date by which the employer must abate a violation depends on the stage to which a case has progressed. This definition
sets forth the various ways an abatement date is determined. Circumstance (1) refers to the date actually set forth
in the citation, where the citation item has not been contested. As explained in Section I, this date applies even if
it is with the fifteen-working-day period normally available for the filing of a notice of contest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (2) is self-explanatory, as it refers simply to adding to the final order date either the amount of time
in days initially specified for abatement on the citation or, if that period was modified by the Commission or its judge,
the amount of time so modified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (3) refers to a date for abatement ``expressly set forth'' by the Commission, or a Commission administrative
law judge. The phrase ``expressly set forth'' refers to a date certain or to a set number of days from the final order
date specified date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (4) refers to a date set in a PMA final order. The term (PMA) refers to a petition for modification of the
abatement date described in Section 10(c) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 659(c). A PMA final order results either from OSHA's
approval of an uncontested PMA or the Commission's approval, modification or rejection of the employer's request
for additional time in order to complete abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Circumstance (5) refers to settlement agreements signed by OSHA and the employer, and, in some cases, employees or
their authorized representatives. As in circumstance(3) the phrase ``expressly set forth'' refers to a date certain
or to a set number of days from the final order date or other specified date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abatement plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As the definition implies with its reference to ``outlining a schedule for the implementation of measures to achieve
abatement'', an abatement plan required by a citation will specify the requirement for and the frequency of ``progress
reports.'' Generally, abatement plans and progress reports will be associated with multi-step or long-term abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Citation item.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A citation item is a single instance of a violation. For example, a citation may contain ``Item 1'', alleging that the
employer has one machine in violation of 29 CFR 1910.212(a)(1) because it was not guarded. A citation may also list
several violations of the same standard under the same citation item, for example ``Item 1, instance a'', and ``Item
1, instance b''. ``Item 1, Instance a'', and ``Item 1, Instance b'', etc. are all separate ``citation items'' within
the meaning of the proposed regulation. Final order date: The date a citation becomes a final order is the date on which
a citation becomes effective. The major ways a citation can become a final order are detailed in the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category is that of an uncontested citation. If there is no contest by either the employer or the employees,
the citation becomes a final order automatically, fifteen (15) working days after the date the employer receives
the citation and proposed penalty, pursuant to Section 10 of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. 659.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second category refers to situations in which there has been a contest either by the employer or by employees, resulting
in the issuance of a decision or order by an ALJ. Under Section 12(j) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect;661(j), a decision
of an ALJ becomes a final order of the Commission thirty days ``after such report'' if no member of the Commission directs
review of the case. Section 12(j) has been construed by the Commission to mean that the thirty-day period runs from
the date on which the decision of the ALJ is docketed by the Commission. (See 29 CFR 2200.90(b)(2); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Robert W. Setterlin &amp; Sons Co., 4 BNA OSHC 1214 (No. 7377, 1976)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third category refers to decisions issued by the Members of the Commission, including orders severing items from
a case. Pursuant to Section 10(c) of the OSH Act, 29 U.S.C. &sect;659(c), such decisions become final orders thirty
days after their issuance, and the filing of petitions for review of these decisions in a court of appeals does not stay
the employer's abatement obligation unless a stay has been expressly ordered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth category addresses the two situations in which the start of an employer's abatement obligation depends
on action by a court. In those cases in which a court of appeals stays an abatement requirement, the abatement requirement
starts when the court issues its mandate or an equivalent order following a decision of the court upholding the Commission's
affirmance of the citation. In those cases where the Commission did not affirm a citation but the court reverses that
decision, the abatement obligation starts upon the court's issuance of its mandate or equivalent order unless the
court remands the case to the Commission for the issuance of an appropriate Commission order. In that situation, the
abatement period starts when the Commission's order becomes final thirty days after its issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PMA final order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is the order approving, modifying or rejecting the employer's request for additional time to complete the abatement
requirements of the citation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c), Abatement Certificate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c)(1) specifies the minimum content of the abatement certificate; (c)(2) provides special procedures
for reissuing an abatement certificate for those situations where abatement was not initially completed; and (c)(3)
allows an employer to combine the individual certifications of hazard abatement into one certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4) of the proposed regulation requires the abatement certificate to be accompanied by ``documentary
evidence.'' OSH envisions ``documentary evidence'' to be any type of document which provides evidence that a violative
condition which was cited has, in fact, been abated. The examples of documentary evidence which follow are provided
in order to clarify OSHA's intent and are not to be considered as the only methods which would be acceptable to the Agency,
nor are they automatically accepted in all cases: (1) An invoice or receipt for purchase or disposal of goods and services;
(2) analyses or reports from industrial hygienists, engineers, or other experts indicating the methods by which
the extent to which the hazardous condition has been abated; (3) a manufacturer's recertification for repaired equipment;
(4) contracts and specifications for services; (5) training records, programs, and attendance sheets; (6) in-house
certification; (7) photographic prints depicting the abated condition which have been labeled appropriately with
the citation and item references as they appeared on the citation; and (8) videotape with concise audio and/or visual
identification for the citation reference.

Paragraph (d), Abatement Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) of the proposed regulation refers to written abatement plans. OSHA currently requests employers to
submit abatement plans when the Area Director finds them appropriate in connection with safety or health violations.
The proposed regulation would give the Area Director discretion to require abatement plans with respect to either
safety or health violations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e) of the proposal refers to written progress reports. OSHA policy currently provides for progress reports
whenever the Area Director requests them in connection with safety or health violations requiring multi-step or
long term abatement. The proposed regulation would make such progress reports mandatory when required by the Area
Director and indicated on the citation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f), Tagging of Cited Equipment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f) of the proposed regulation requires the placement of a tag on cited equipment in order to alert employees
who might be exposed to the hazards of that equipment. The tag will state that this equipment has been cited. This procedure
will address the situation, common to the construction industry, in which cited equipment is removed from one worksite
to another where employees are not aware of the hazardous condition. The tag requirements found in this proposed regulation
are intended to provide such employees with knowledge of the violative condition of the equipment. The proposal provides
that these warning tags shall comply with the current OSHA requirements for accident prevention tags (i.e. use, signal
word, and general tag criteria) found in &sect;1910.145(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would require the tag to remain in place on the equipment until the defect has been remedied.
If the equipment is removed from the workplace, sold, or otherwise transferred, it is OSHA's intent that the tag remain
on the equipment. Mere lack of employee exposure to the equipment will not allow the employer to remove the tag.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference to ``tagging equipment'' does not require the tagging of supplies, furnishings, policies, procedures
or building service distribution systems such as for water. However, individual component parts within a distribution
system may be subject to tagging. For example, an unguarded drive shaft on a circulating pump in a water distribution
system found in violation of the machine guarding standard would be considered equipment within the meaning of the
regulation and thus require tagging.

Paragraph (g), Transmittal of Documents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has included the following note in paragraph (g).

Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Receipt of an employer's documents by the Agency under this regulation does not constitute an agreement that the employer
is in compliance.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are three reasons for this provision. First, although the Agency will try to evaluate submitted material in
a timely fashion, other agency priorities may delay such action. Second, in some cases, the submitted materials may
not accurately or completely describe the abatement. Third, changing working conditions may make the abatement
action described in the materials submitted inaccurate or inadequate.

Paragraph (i), Posting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (i)(5) of the proposed regulation states that the final abatement certificate must remain posted until
abatement has been completed or for six calendar days, whichever is later. Thus, if abatement has been completed,
the certificate shall remain posted for at least six days after completion. If abatement has not been completed, the
abatement certificate initially submitted shall remain posted until the violation has been abated. When abatement
has been accomplished, the new final abatement certificate shall remain posted for six days. If a final abatement
certificate deals with a number of citation items, it shall remain posted for as long as it takes to comply with the posting
requirements for all of the items. OSHA believes that the posting of the abatement certificate will inform employees
whether or not the hazard has been abated and also help to assure the accuracy of the certificate.

This proposed regulation is authorized by Sections 8(c)(1), 8(g)(2), and 9(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 (the Act), 29 U.S.C. 657 and 658. Under Section 8(c)(1) ``[e]ach employer shall make, keep and preserve,

Services] *&blank;*&blank;*, may prescribe by regulation as necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this
Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses.''
Section 8(g)(2) empowers the Secretary of labor to ``prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary
to carry out [his] responsibilities under this Act.'' Moreover, pursuant to Section 8(c)(1), the Secretary has authority
to issue regulations requiring employers to keep their employees informed of the employers' responsibilities under
the Act. Section 9(b) authorizes the Secretary to promulgate regulations associated with the posting of citations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Secretary's responsibilities under the Act are defined largely by its enumerated purposes, which
include: Providing for appropriate reporting procedures that will help achieve the objectives of this Act and accurately
describe the nature of the occupational safety and health problem [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(12)]; developing innovative
methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(5)];
and providing an effective enforcement program [29 U.S.C. 651(b)(10)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Secretary asserts that the proposed regulation is necessary and appropriate
to conduct enforcement responsibilities under the Act, to develop information about the prevention of occupational
accidents and illnesses, and to inform employees of their protections and obligations under the Act.

IV. Comments and Information Requested
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested on all issues involving the proposed regulation. In particular, OSHA requests comment on the
following questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What type of documentary evidence should OSHA require employers to submit as proof of final abatement? Should the
type of documentation required to be submitted as proof of final abatement vary according to what is required for abatement,
the type of hazard, or the classification of violation (i.e., willful, repeat, serious, other-than-serious, regulatory)?
What criteria should OSHA apply in judging either the sufficiency or quality of the documentation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What are the costs (time and money) of complying with this new regulation and the basis for estimating these costs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What will be the effects of the requirement that employers post their abatement documents?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. How do the proposed abatement verification procedures differ from current or previous practices of informing
OSHA that abatement has been accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. How much time does each employer currently spend on abatement verification?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. What is the appropriate level of management to sign the abatement verification?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. What are employer experiences with verifying abatement of cited conditions for other Federal and State agencies,
especially State occupational safety and health agencies?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Given the need for evidence of abatement, should an employer be required to submit abatement certification if the
employer has actually abated the condition during the OSHA inspection?

VI. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis for Abatement Verification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introductory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires regulatory agencies to assess the costs and benefits of intended regulations,
to consider the possible alternatives, and to select the most cost-effective form of regulation. The Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to consider
the impact of the regulation on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory impact analysis presents the costs, benefits (cost savings), and economic impact of the proposed
regulation requiring certification of abatement. The impact on small businesses is also presented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has preliminarily concluded that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined
in Executive Order 12866, Section 3, Paragraph (f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation for abatement verification would require employers to notify OSHA Area Directors whether
or not cited violations have been abated. It would require employer to notify OSHA Area Directors whether or not cited
violations have been abated. It would also require employers to offer documentation of abatement plans and progress
reports for multi-step abatement efforts. Based on a survey of OSHA regional offices, OSHA estimates that as many
as 70 percent of cited employers eventually certify and document their abatement actions to some degree at the present
time. This regulatory action will potentially affect all employers covered by the OSH Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulatory action can impose penalties for non-reporting of conditions even if they have been abated and can
also lead to an increase in the penalties that employers face from unabated, violative conditions. Failure to verify
abatement on a timely basis is an additional violation. When abatement is verified by the employer but not actually
performed, criminal penalties for false statement may apply. Increased penalties give employers an incentive both
to abate and to verify abatement, and to do so in a timely manner. Abatement reduces the risk of injury, illness, and
death for employees. The Agency has not estimated the extent of injuries, illnesses, and deaths averted by this regulatory
action, because abatement itself is already required by the OSH Act.

Certifying Abatement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal OSHA and State-plan agencies performed about 127,000 workplace inspections in 1991, issuing about 413,000
separate (upgrouped) violations (Table 1). Less than 1 percent of the violations were for failure to abate. About
10 percent of all citations were contested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were about 9,000 follow-up inspections by OSHA and State-plan agencies in 1991 that resulted in about 4,300
violations, of which 71 were for failure to abate (Table 2). About 18 percent of all follow-up violations were contested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency estimates that it will take firms, on average, 15 minutes to prepare and mail documentation to certify abatement,
independent of firm size. The Agency estimates that the managers or proprietors who prepare the certification of
abatement earn a total wage of $25 per hour, based on data in the Bureau of Labor Statistics news, June 18, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ceiling, or maximum estimate, of the cost to employers for verifying abatement, including preparation of abatement
certificates and submission of documentation, can be calculated by multiplying the number of violations with the
estimated average time to verify abatement (not the time and cost to comply with the OSHA standard cited) and with the
supervisory wage rate (annual, including benefits), or
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

412,707 violations &times; .25 hours per citation &times; $25/hour=

=$2.6 million annually.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a large fraction of employers cited for violations now inform OSHA that abatement was performed and sometimes
offer documentation, the new additional cost to employers from this regulation is probably much less than the ceiling
estimate of $2.6 million annually. Other costs, such as for photocopying, photography, or other documenting activity,
are believed to be minimal. The cost of tags for cited equipment is also minor as both the general industry and construction
standards already contain accident prevention tagging requirements (See 1910.145 and 1926.200).

Abatement Plans and Progress Reports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulation allows the Agency's Area Director ``at his or her discretion'' to require an abatement plan
and progress reports when multi-step abatement is ``deemed appropriate.'' At the current time, when the Area Director
issues a citation to an employer (usually involving air contaminants, noise, or ergonomics) which will require a
long, or multi-step, abatement effort, the citation letter lists both the steps to be taken and a schedule for completion.
The Agency in its citation letter informs the employer that it must send progress reports to the Area Director.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the employer will have in hand OSHA's proposed plan for multi-step abatement to use as a guide, the Agency estimates
that it will take an employer two hours to write the plan as required by the proposed regulation. The Agency estimates
that, on average, there are three steps in a multi-step abatement and that it will take the employer 30 minutes to prepare
each progress report. The Agency estimates that the total wage rate of a supervisor, manager, or proprietor who would
perform this work is $25 per hour (Bureau of Labor Statistics News, June 18, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, citations requiring multi-stage abatement efforts are a small percentage of all citations. Virtually
all of the multi-stage abatements for Federal violations are for three causes: Ergonomics, noise, and permissible
air limits. In 1991 there were 749 Federal OSHA inspections that resulted in citations for ergonomics, air contaminants,
noise, or single-substance OSHA standards, resulting in 1,934 violations (all of which would have required multiple
step abatement). Based on this number of multi-stage abatements required in Fiscal year 1991, and assuming that State-plan
agencies had an equal number, the Agency estimates that the cost of proposing multi-step abatement plans and providing
progress reports is:

Verification Efforts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulatory action will reduce time-consuming efforts required of OSHA's enforcement officers to verify and
document abatement in order to close files, thereby increasing the time available for inspection activities. OSHA's
Directorate of Compliance Programs estimates that these efforts consume approximately 5 percent of compliance
staff time, or the equivalent of 50 full-time compliance officers for Federal enforcement. The Agency estimates
that an equal number of full-time equivalents perform this task for State-plan agencies, or a total of 100 full-time-equivalents.
With an average estimated salary of $50,000 including benefits, the dollar value of this time is approximately $5
million annually. The Agency estimates that the increased work of collecting and analyzing abatement certificates
and accompanying documentation for enforcement agencies will be minor_OSHA is currently receiving abatement information
for approximately 70 percent of its citations. The Agency estimates that affected employers should also save approximately
the same amount of time and money ($5 million annually) spent in responding to OSHA's letters and calls seeking verification
of abatement.

Follow-Up Inspections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1991, Federal OSHA performed about 2,000 follow-up inspections, and State-plan agencies about 7,000 (Table
2), for a total of about 9,000 annually. Combined, these efforts represented 100,700 staff hours,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 or approximately 50 full-time compliance officers. One of the Agency's goals in promulgating this regulation is
to reduce the resources employed in follow-up inspections as well as other unproductive efforts associated with
abatement verification. The Agency's Directorate of Compliance estimates that under this regulation, the Agency
will decrease its follow-up inspections by half, and OSHA estimates that State-plan agencies will do the same. With
an estimated average salary and benefits of $50,000, cutting follow-up inspections by half will save enforcement
agencies $1.25 million in resources annually.

Although a significant portion of a Compliance Officer's time is spent in preparation and travel to a worksite for
these inspections, at the worksite he or she is accompanied by one or more employer representatives as well as an employees
representative. The Agency estimates that: The total hourly wage of the employer's representative is $25; the total
wage of the employee's representative is $15 (BLS News, June 18, 1993); and that a follow-up inspection takes, on average,
three hours. The Agency estimates that reducing the number of follow-up inspections by half will annually save employers
$540,000 [4,500 inspections &times; 3 hrs &times; ($25 + $15)].

D. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency estimates that the economic impact on individual employers, industry profits, and product prices to be
insignificant for every affected industry, and therefore concludes that the regulation is economically feasible.
Only 15 minutes of a manager's time, on average, should be needed to verify abatement and provide some documentation.
Since employers will avoid time spent responding to verification requests from the Agency as well as follow-up inspections,
the Agency estimates that overall there is a net savings for employers. There is a savings of resources for Federal
OSHA and State-plan states. As a whole this regulation should result in a saving of resources (Table 3).

VII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Agency preliminarily certifies that the proposed regulation would not have a significant impact on small businesses
in any industry. As shown in the earlier section on costs of compliance, the cost to individual small establishments
is estimated to be the same as for larger establishments. The costs to establishments in every industry are very low.
In addition, OSHA inspects proportionately more large establishments than small establishments, and the Agency
as a matter of policy does not perform some types of inspections on establishments having ten or fewer employees. The
Agency therefore concludes that this regulation does not place any undue burden on small businesses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR part 1500), and the Department of Labor's
NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). The Agency estimates that the regulation and employers' compliance efforts will
not have any impact on the environment or result in the release of materials that contaminate natural resources or
the environment.

IX. Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987),
regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting State policy
options, consult with States prior to taking any actions which would restrict State policy options, and take such
actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope. The Order
provides for preemption of State law only if there is a clear congressional intent for the Agency to do so. Any such preemption
is to be limited to the extent possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to States that do not have State plans, the proposed regulation conforms to the preemption provisions
of section 18 of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C. 667) which preempts State promulgation and enforcement of requirements dealing
with occupational safety and health issues covered by Federal OSHA standards unless the State has an OSHA-approved
State plan. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 112 S.Ct. 2374 (1992). Since States without State plans are already prohibited from issuing citations for violations
of requirements covered by Federal OSHA standards, the proposed regulation does not expand this limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency certifies that this proposed regulation has been assessed in accordance with the principles, criteria,
and requirements set forth in sections 2 through 5 of Executive Order 12612. Section 18(c)(2) of the OSH Act [29 U.S.C.
667(c)(2)] provides that an OSHA-approved State plan must provide for the development and enforcement of safety
and health standards which are, or will be, at least as effective as the Federal program. In implementing this requirement,
29 CFR 1902.3(d)(1) requires a State plan to provide a program for the enforcement of the State standards which is,
or will be, at least as effective as that provided under the OSH Act, and provide assurances that the State-plan enforcement
program will continue to be at least as effective as the Federal program. Furthermore, 29 CFR 1902.4(a) requires State
plans to establish the same procedures and rules as those established by Federal OSHA, or alternative procedures
and rules as effective as the Federal procedures and rules. In particular, a State plan must provide that employees
be informed of their protections and obligations under the Act. 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(iv). It must also provide for
prompt notice to employers and employees when an alleged violation of standards has occurred, including the proposed
abatement requirements, by such means as the issuance and posting of citations. 29 CFR 1902.4(c)(2)(x). Since the
proposed regulation will improve Federal OSHA's effectiveness in enforcing the OSH Act and, in particular, will
foster the abatement of violations and communication to employees about their protections under the Act, State plans
will be required to adopt an identical regulation, or an equivalent regulation that is at least as effective as the
Federal regulation, within six months of Federal promulgation. Thus, the proposed regulation complies with the
Executive Order 12612 with respect to State plan states because (1) it deals with a problem of national scope, and (2)
the OSH Act requires that State-plan states adopt OSHA regulations or equally effective regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

State comments are invited on this proposal and will be fully considered before a final regulation is promulgated.

X. State Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are currently 25 states and other jurisdictions with OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans.
These 25 jurisdictions are: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont,
Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming; and Connecticut and New York (for State and Local government
employees only).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 jurisdictions with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans will be required to adopt
a regulation on abatement verification that is at least as effective as this Federal regulation within six months
of the publication date of this Federal regulation (i.e. six months after the final rule is published).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current State abatement verification-procedures are described in State field operation manuals and/or directives.
Although these State procedures may differ from the Federal procedures, the State-plan states, like OSHA, generally
lack regulations or statutory provisions specifically addressing this issue, with the exception of Wyoming which
does have a regulation requiring abatement verification. Current State abatement verification procedures are
identical to the Federal except as described below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nine States have abatement verification forms: Alaska, California, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon,
South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming. On these forms, the employers describe the specific measures taken to correct
each alleged violation. Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Michigan, and Kentucky also ask for documentary evidence.
Alaska requests employers to certify under penalty of perjury that the violations were abated by the dates specified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) California and Minnesota ask employers to submit progress reports. California requests monthly progress reports
for all long-term abatements, while Minnesota requests a progress report for all serious and most other violations
of the State's general industry and construction standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For long-term abatements, California requests employers to submit an abatement plan which outlines their procedures
for abatement, such as plans for controls to be installed, and schedules for engineering, purchasing, and installation.
Washington schedules follow-up inspections every six months to check progress made on long-term or multi-step abatement
plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Some States (e.g., South Carolina and California) send a reminder letter to the employer just before the abatement
verification form is due. Washington reminds employers by letter or telephone. Kentucky and California also send
follow-up letters if the form is overdue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Maryland tracks informal conference settlements to determine if abatement documentation is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Wyoming has an enforcement regulation requiring the submission of written documents saying when abatement has
been accomplished. Failure to do so can result in a civil penalty. Wyoming can also take legal action to enforce submission
of a letter of abatement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) New York, which covers only state and local government employees, conducts follow-up inspections to verify abatement
for every violation; employers are not asked to send in any abatement verification information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments, data, views, and arguments on any issue raised by this
proposed regulation. These comments must be postmarked by July 18, 1994, and submitted in quadruplicate to the OSHA

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed abatement verification regulation requires employers to submit to OSHA (1) an abatement certificate
and accompanying documentary evidence, (2) abatement plans and progress reports when specifically required on
the citation, and (3) verification that the hazardous conditions cited have been corrected. In accordance with the
provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act and regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted
the information collection requirements for this proposal to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average fifteen minutes per citation

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Questions were raised by both industry and within NASA regarding certain aspects of the coverage on pension portability.
The majority of the questions concerned the lack of consistency of NASA's installations regarding the vesting period
requirements and whether the pension portability requirements should apply to subcontracts. The purpose of this
change is to address those issues. The rule also requires the use of the clause at 48 CFR 1852.237&hyph;71 rather than
allowing a clause substantially the same as that one. It also adds a condition for determining when pension portability
would be appropriate. Furthermore, the rule replaces the requirement that a copy of each written determination by
the procurement officer to use pension portability be sent to the Associate Administrator for Procurement with one
that the procurement officer only need keep a record of all such determinations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not impose any reporting or record keeping requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.

(a) It is NASA's policy not to require pension portability in service contracts. However, pension portability requirements
may be included in a solicitation, contract, or contract modification for additional work under the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) There is a continuing need for the same or similar services for a minimum of five years (inclusive of options)
and, if and when the contractor changes, a high percentage of the predecessor contractor's employees are expected
to remain with the program; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the employees under a predecessor contract were covered by a portable pension plan, a follow-on contract
or a contract consolidating existing services shall include pension portability as long as the total contract period
covered by the plan, past and future, covers five years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only defined contribution plans, or multiparty defined benefit plans operated under a collective bargaining
agreement where the plan follows the employee instead of the employer, shall be permitted in the portability provisions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Vesting shall be 100 percent at the earlier of one year of continuous employee service or contract termination;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is a clear description of the plan, including coverage regarding service, pay, liabilities, vesting, termination,
and benefits from prior contracts, as appropriate; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The procurement officer has made a written determination that such a provision is in the Government's best interest,
including the facts supporting that determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The procurement officer shall maintain a record of all written determinations that the use of pension portability
is in the Government's best interest.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes reclassifying the saltwater crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Australia from endangered to threatened, and the Papua New Guinea population as threatened by reason of similarity
of appearance under the provisions of the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973. The saltwater crocodile has been
listed as endangered throughout its range since 1979, except the Papua New Guinea population, which has never been
listed. A special rule is also proposed that would allow for the importation of certain specimens of saltwater crocodiles
from Australia and Papua New Guinea into the United States in the course of a commercial activity provided that such
import is consistent with the requirements of the Convention on International Trade in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and certain other provisions. This proposal also reproposes the
special rule for the Nile crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus niloticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and will be consistent with the proposed special rule for the saltwater crocodile. When the Service previously proposed
reclassifying the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened status, the comments received on the proposed special
rule that accompanied that proposed reclassification led the Service to repropose the special rule.

A. Status and Listing History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The saltwater or estuarine crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) ranges from southwest India and along its eastern coast, throughout Southeast Asia and through the Pacific Islands
as far east as Fiji and south to the northern coast of Australia. The majority of populations have been reported from
the following countries: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Australia, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, the
Philippines, and Vietnam. It is the largest crocodilian species, reaching lengths well over 20 feet (6.1 meters).
The species inhabits estuaries, mangrove swamps, and tidal reaches of rivers (The World Conservation Union (IUCN)
1975). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the 1979 meeting of the Parties to CITES, the saltwater crocodile was transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I,
except for the population in Papua New Guinea which was retained on Appendix II. On December 16, 1979 (44 FR 75074),
the Service listed all saltwater crocodile populations outside of Papua New Guinea as endangered. Both of these actions
were taken because the species had suffered serious losses of habitat throughout most of its range and it had been subject
to extensive poaching for its hide. At their 1985 meeting, the CITES Parties voted to transfer the Australian population
from Appendix I to Appendix II of CITES pursuant to resolution Conf. 3.15 (ranching) and to transfer the Indonesian
population from Appendix I to Appendix II pursuant to resolution Conf. 5.21, making Indonesia subject to export quotas
approved by the Parties. Under current Australian law, the effect of this action was to allow trade in captive-bred
specimens and specimens taken from approved crocodile farm operations based on controlled collecting of eggs or
hatchlings or nuisance animals from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1990, the Service received a petition from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) requesting
the reclassification of the captive (i.e., captive-bred and ranched) populations of saltwater crocodile in Australia
from endangered to threatened. The petition contained information on the management of wild and captive populations,
population surveys, and legal status. The Service had previously reviewed almost the same information, which was
considered substantial, and the Service was in the process of preparing a proposed rule based on the earlier information
when the petition was received. On September 27, 1990, the Service, acting on this assessment but without issuing
a formal finding, published a proposed rule (55 FR 39489) to reclassify the Australian population of the saltwater
crocodile to threatened status. The proposed rule included a special rule which allowed for the commercial import
of parts and products of ranched saltwater crocodiles from Australia directly into the United States, or through
a third party if that receiving country was a CITES member that filed annual CITES trade reports and any re-exporting
country was also a CITES member. In the absence of a required universal tagging system for crocodilian skins, however,
trade controls were considered insufficient to justify uncontrolled trade through third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Publication of the final rule was delayed beyond the 12 months normally allowed because of concerns about allowing
trade in products of one crocodilian species without adequate control of trade in other crocodilians and pending
acceptance of universal tagging procedures for crocodilian skins in international trade. Resolution Conf. 8.14
adopted at the 1992 Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan, established a new marking system that
will provide for strict regulation of trade in all crocodilian skins. The new marking program should be in place as
of January 1995.

In the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 27, 1990, (55 FR 39489) the Service announced that available information indicated that both wild and
captive populations of saltwater crocodiles in Australia should be reclassified from endangered to threatened,
and issued a proposed rule to that effect. In that proposal, all interested parties were requested to submit comments
and information that might contribute to the development of a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine comments were received: two from ANPWS; one from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO), Division of Wildlife and Ecology; three from the trade industry; and one each from the IUCN
Crocodile Specialist Group for Eastern Asia, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia, and TRAFFIC-USA. All supported
the proposed reclassification, but some had objections to the proposed special rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ANPWS fully supported the reclassification of the Australian population of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus porosus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Dr. Graeme Caughley, Chief Research Scientist of CSIRO, stated that he saw no reason that ESA and CITES should necessarily
coincide, but in the case of the Australian saltwater crocodile, he favored the controls on trade that were established
under CITES. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Grahame Webb, Vice Chairman for Eastern Asia_Crocodile Specialist Group, supported the proposed changes. He
reported that crocodile populations within Australia are particularly well-managed and that all skins exported
are tagged and clearly identified as having come from Australia. Several crocodile farmers and traders (Crocodile
Farmers Association of Australia, G. Webb Pty. Ltd., and Mainland Holding Pty. Ltd.) all supported the reclassification
of the saltwater crocodile in Australia to threatened status. They stated that the detailed survey work confirming
the expansion of populations and monitoring of habitat justifies this action. The recovery of the population in Australia
since protection and the present management of and research on the species was said to warrant the proposed change
in regulation by the Service.

Crocodylus porosus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
populations in Australia from endangered to threatened, bringing the designation in line with the current CITES
listing. This was only supported, however, in full recognition of the conservation status (vulnerable) recently
assigned to the species by the IUCN (IUCN 1990). TRAFFIC USA furnished helpful comments on the special rule and the
reporting requirements as called for under Article VIII of CITES.

C. Explanation of Proposed Rule for the Saltwater Crocodile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule, if made final, would revise &sect;17.11(h) to reclassify the Australian population of the saltwater
crocodile from endangered to threatened. Since it is difficult to distinguish between the skins and products derived
from different saltwater crocodile populations, the Service also proposes to revise &sect;17.11(h) to list the
saltwater crocodile population of Papua New Guinea as threatened by similarity of appearance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Australian and Papua New Guinea populations are defined by distinct geo-political boundaries that delineate
an area representing a significant portion of the range of the species. In addition, both populations are biologically
significant in maintaining variability of the species and in preventing the further decline of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the requirements of sections 3(3) and 4(d) of the ESA, this proposed rule also would amend &sect;17.42
by adding a new paragraph to allow for the commercial importation of certain specimens from Australia and Papua New
Guinea into the United States without a threatened species permit but pursuant to CITES trade controls and marking
requirements and certain other specified criteria (provisions of the proposed special rule are described later
in this notice). Under CITES, Australia may export saltwater crocodile skins, meat, or products only if the specimen
is captively bred in a breeding system that is generally maintained without augmentation from the wild, or the specimen
is derived from a crocodile farm operation following CITES ranching provisions and under an approved management
program.

D. Summary of Factors Affecting the Australian Population of Saltwater Crocodile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the ESA (50 CFR part 424) set forth five factors
to be used in determining whether to add, reclassify, or remove a species from the list of endangered and threatened
species. These factors and their applicability to populations of the saltwater crocodile in Australia are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The saltwater crocodile occupies a variety of tidal and non-tidal habitats across northern Australia from Maryborough
on the Queensland east coast to Broome on the Western Australian west coast. The Northern Territory has more extensive
areas of prime saltwater crocodile habitat than either Queensland or Western Australia (report from the Australian
National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) 1990, titled, ``Evidence in Support of a Petition by Australia to the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to Remove Captive Populations of the Saltwater Crocodile,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Australia from the Endangered Species List under the U.S. Endangered Species Act 1973''_copy on file with the Office
of Scientific Authority). Exploitation of crocodiles in Australia began on a large scale in the late 1940's and extended
into the early 1970's. During this time, populations in the rivers along the north coast were nearly extirpated with

 1979). Export of saltwater crocodiles and their parts from Australia was prohibited in 1972. Today, the habitats
are largely intact across the whole of northern Australia, and the species occupies the whole of its known historical
range within the country. The species is protected in the three states where it occurs (the Northern Territory, Queensland,
and Western Australia). Management programs allowing limited utilization of wild stocks for crocodile farm operations
have been implemented by the states in light of the crocodile's increasing population size.

According to the ANPWS (ANPWS 1990, op. cit.), the Northern Territory population of saltwater crocodiles has undergone
significant recovery since protection from hunting in 1972. Analysis of all available monitoring results from 1975
to 1987 shows that the density of wild saltwater crocodiles in tidal rivers has tripled since surveying began. In 1984,

Between 1984 and 1987, monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results indicated that the tidal population increased by 16.5 percent. Assuming that this rate of increase can be
applied to the

Extensive helicopter surveys across the entire range of habitat types present in Cape York Peninsula, Queensland,
resulted in the sighting of some 2,400 animals. Actual population numbers are likely to be considerably higher. It
is not possible to derive an estimate of absolute numbers for Queensland, but sampling of potentially suitable habitats
yielded an average density index of 0.77 crocodile/km of waterway. Surveys in 1977&hyph;78 resulted in a population
estimate of about 2,000 crocodiles beyond the hatchling stage for Western Australia. The population was estimated
at 2,500 crocodiles beyond the hatchling stage when it was resurveyed in 1986.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Population estimates of saltwater crocodiles in Australia were not made prior to 1970. Over- exploitation for the
skin trade and persecution as undesirable wildlife began in the late 1940's and did not subside until hunting was banned
in 1972. The export of saltwater crocodiles and their parts from Australia was prohibited in 1972 by an amendment of
the customs regulations. By that time, many accessible populations had become seriously threatened with extirpation.
With the enactment of state and territorial protection laws [Wildlife Conservation and Control Ordinance (1962)_Northern
Territories; the Fauna Conservation Act (1974)_Queensland; and the Wildlife Conservation Act (1950)_Western
Australia], the populations showed an immediate response and have tripled in numbers since surveying began in the
late 1970's (ANPWS 1990, op. cit) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the 1985 meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CITES, the Australian saltwater crocodile population was transferred
from Appendix I to Appendix II, pursuant to resolution Conf. 3.15 on ranching. This provides for trade in saltwater
crocodiles bred in captivity or raised on farms under approved management plans. The transfer was recommended by
the Australian Council of Nature Conservation Ministers and IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group. The Australian CITES
proposal to transfer the Australian population of saltwater crocodile to Appendix II to allow trade under the ranching
provision was based on a series of experimental egg harvests and quantification of the impacts of those harvests.
No discernible impact of this egg harvest has been detected on the number of crocodiles in subsequent age classes.
Australia allows a regulated annual harvest of crocodile eggs for farm operations under approved management plans.
The effects of the egg harvests are quantified and assessed through monitoring programs in the harvested areas. Approval
to harvest eggs incorporates a commitment that if any decline in the wild population were to occur, a larger number
of 1-year old crocodiles would be returned to the wild than would have survived had no eggs or hatchlings been removed
from the wild. At the present time, only the Northern Territory and Western Australia have approved management plans
under which the harvest of eggs is allowed for ranching operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to information provided by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS 1990, op. cit.),
the capture and relocation of nuisance crocodiles can only be authorized by State government personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Northern Territories, nuisance animals are caught alive and relocated to farms whenever practical. In other
cases, they are destroyed by Northern Territory Conservation Commission personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Western Australia, problem crocodiles are captured and removed, or where the level of risk to humans is unacceptable,
permission to kill the crocodile may be given. In both States, those problem animals relocated to farms are individually
marked and, if not required for captive breeding, are available for harvest after they have been maintained in captivity
for a minimum of 30 days. In Queensland, crocodiles may be removed to provide breeding stock for closed-cycle farms.
Nuisance animals may be removed to provide breeding stock or destroyed where other options are not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traditional harvest of crocodiles and crocodile eggs for food by Aborigines of the Northern Territory is allowed.
However, the low level of traditional harvests is not considered a threat to the populations. Traditional use does
not include commercial trade.

The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The saltwater crocodile is recognized as a valuable resource in Australia, where laws and regulations are in place
to prevent over- exploitation of these animals. Since the ban on hunting in 1972, saltwater crocodile populations
have substantially increased in numbers. State wildlife laws govern the take, possession, and trade in saltwater
crocodiles. Also, the Commonwealth Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act of 1982, administered
by the ANPWS, helps to protect wildlife that might otherwise be threatened by unregulated export. Under this Act,
export of saltwater crocodiles, their parts and products requires an export permit. Permits may be issued only for
scientific purposes, or for specimens derived from captive-bred animals, or animals taken under an approved management
program. Maximum penalties for violations of the Act are a AUS$100,000 fine and/or 5 years imprisonment for individuals,
and AUS$200,000 for corporations. The substantial increase in maximum penalties for attempting to illegally export
saltwater crocodile skins from Australia (from $1,000 up to $200,000) is considered to be an effective deterrent.
In addition to legislation and policies regulating take within Australia, export of saltwater crocodiles is regulated
by CITES, to which Australia is a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation of take has been a factor in the continued improvement of Australia's saltwater crocodile populations
in the wild. This significant improvement has prompted the Service to propose reclassification of the saltwater
crocodile in Australia from endangered to threatened.

Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive system of nature conservation reserves has been developed, so that approximately 40 million hectares
of all habitats throughout Australia, or 5.5 percent of the total land surface, is reserved under different categories.
Parks, reserves, and sanctuaries in Northern Australia provide a mosaic of areas in which crocodiles and their habitats
are protected. Significant areas of crocodile habitat are contained in at least six parks or nature reserves. In addition,
nearly 37 million hectares are protected under various state and national marine and estuarine protected area categories.
The Cobourg Peninsula Marine National Park was declared in 1983 to protect, among other species, the saltwater crocodile.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best biological and commercial information with respect to past, present,
and future threats faced by the species in issuing this proposed rule. Criteria for reclassification of a threatened
or endangered species (50 CFR 424.11 (c) and (d)) are the same as for listing a species as endangered or threatened.
The proposed action is to reclassify Australia's saltwater crocodile populations from endangered to threatened,
based on continuing recovery of the species. A special rule amending 50 CFR 17.42 to allow for the importation of specimens
into the United States without a threatened species permit is also proposed. This proposed rule is based on substantial
evidence that Australia's populations of the saltwater crocodile have made a remarkable recovery and are no longer
in imminent danger of extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surveys conducted in the late 1980's indicated populations of at least 50,000. Populations are estimated to have
increased three-fold between 1975 and 1987. The species is protected in the three jurisdictions in which it occurs
and there are closely regulated crocodile farm operations. In light of increasing populations, Australia's strict
regulation of harvest, and the requirement of a management program prior to approval of crocodile farm operations,
several threats to the existence of the saltwater crocodile in Australia have been ameliorated. Therefore, the Service
believes that reclassification to threatened best fits the current status of saltwater crocodile populations in
Australia.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other populations throughout the species' range are still in danger of extinction, to varying degrees, by taking.
Penalties for illegal exports and enforcement activities will help ensure that illegal skins or products do not enter
into commercial trade. Because crocodiles of the Australian population cannot be distinguished from saltwater
crocodiles of other populations and from other endangered crocodilians once made into manufactured products, the
Service is proposing a special rule to strengthen the implementation of the CITES skin-tagging program (see description
presented later in this notice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reclassification to a threatened status and adoption of a special rule allowing commercial trade under
certain conditions would not end trade controls for the species. The species remains on Appendix II of CITES with export
permits required, and the special rule would require adherence to the CITES marking scheme for crocodilian skins,
among other things discussed later in this document when provisions of the special rule are described. Trade in legally
harvested saltwater crocodile skins, meat, and products, when controlled as specified in the special rule, will
provide an incentive for conserving the species without posing significant risks to wild populations.

E. Summary of Criteria To List the Papua New Guinea Populations as Threatened by Similarity of Appearance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Papua New Guinea population of the saltwater crocodile is not listed at present under the ESA. In determining whether
to treat a species as endangered or threatened due to similarity of appearance, the Director must consider the criteria
in section 4(e) of the ESA. Section 4(e) of the ESA (16 U.S.C. 1534(e)) and 50 CFR 17.50(b) set forth three criteria in
determining whether to list a species for reasons of similarity of appearance. These factors and their applicability
to populations of the saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The degree of difficulty enforcement personnel would have in distinguishing the species, at the point in question,
from an endangered or threatened species (including those cases where the criteria for recognition of a species are
based on geographical boundaries). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The different populations of saltwater crocodile are morphologically indistinguishable. It is impossible to distinguish
the different geographical populations as live animals, skins or finished products. Thus, Papua New Guinea saltwater
crocodiles, their parts and products cannot be distinguished as to origin by law enforcement personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The additional threat posed to the endangered or threatened species by loss of control occasioned by similarity of
appearance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary threat to other saltwater crocodile populations is the difficulty of identifying skins and products
by geographic region as discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The probability that so designating a similar species will substantially facilitate enforcement and further the
purposes and policy of the ESA. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The populations of saltwater crocodiles in Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea are listed on CITES Appendix
II and are traded in international commerce. The Indonesian population, although listed as endangered by the United
States, is traded among other CITES parties subject to a CITES export quota. International protection has not resulted
in complete cessation of illegal trade in other populations. Only specimens and parts and products from Papua New
Guinea (and under this proposal, from Australia) may be imported into the United States. Designation of the Papua
New Guinea population as threatened by similarity of appearance will help the United States to control illegal trade
of other protected saltwater crocodile populations. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing crocodiles from the
Papua New Guinea population from other populations of saltwater crocodiles and from other endangered crocodilians
once made into manufactured products, the Service is proposing rules to strengthen the implementation of the new
CITES skin tagging program (see description presented later in this notice).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, the Nile crocodile (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Crocodylus niloticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was widespread throughout Africa and Middle East as far north as Syria. Presently, it is confined chiefly to the upstream
regions of the Nile River, tropical and southern Africa, and Madagascar. The Nile crocodile was listed as endangered
in 1970 (35 FR 8495) and on Appendix I of the CITES in 1975 (when CITES came into force) because of the widespread decline
of the species. Since that time, a number of African countries have recognized the value of the Nile crocodile for its
ecological role and as a source of sustainable economic benefit under proper management, especially through ranching
for a controlled harvest of skins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the countries that have started ranching operations, Zimbabwe appears to have the best information on wild crocodile
populations. Improvements in the status of Nile crocodile populations and their management have prompted the CITES
Parties to transfer 11 national populations to Appendix II, allowing commercial trade either under provisions of
the ranching resolutions Conf. 3.15 and 8.22 or subject to export quotas established by agreement of the Parties as
per resolutions Conf. 5.21, 6.17, and 7.14. Populations in Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania,
Zambia, and Zimbabwe have been transferred to Appendix II based on ranching provisions, while populations in Madagascar,
South Africa, and Uganda are permitted under CITES approved export quotas. However, commercial trade is not allowed
from the remaining Nile crocodile range countries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 34095), the Service proposed reclassifying the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened status with a
special rule allowing for commercial importation of skins and finished products thereof. Two organizations, the
IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group, and SAVE African Endangered Wildlife Foundation supported the reclassification
of the Nile crocodile from endangered to threatened. The ANPWS, the Crocodile Farmers Association of Zimbabwe (CFAZ)
and TRAFFIC USA also supported the reclassification but expressed concern about a provision of the proposed special
rule. Therefore, the Service proceeded to downlist the Nile crocodile to threatened status on September 23, 1993,
(58 FR 49870) but without any change in the special rule, which presently applies only to Zimbabwe.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ANPWS, CFAZ, and TRAFFIC USA especially objected to the proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) of &sect;17.42 that would
require crocodile skin products to either be tagged or to be accompanied by CITES documents containing the same information
as is on the tags for the crocodiles from which the manufactured products were obtained. ANPWS stated that the control
of skins removes the need to require every manufactured product to be marked, and also indicated that since Australian
skins used in product production in Australia are not tagged it would not be possible to record the tag numbers of these
products on the CITES permits. CFAZ raised the same concerns as ANPWS. It also expressed the concern that the requirements
of this paragraph were unenforceable and urged that it be deleted. TRAFFIC USA also supported the reclassification
but expressed the belief that proposed paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(C) is impractical and unenforceable. It noted that
``because of the complexities of the crocodilian product manufacturing industry, and the regular movement of skins,
skin parts, and product parts between manufacturers, this requirement. .&blank;.&blank;. will be impossible to
meet.'' Furthermore, TRAFFIC USA expressed support for establishing ``a water-tight system of controlling trade
in the raw material.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes the concerns presented by ANPWS, CFAZ, and TRAFFIC USA, and agrees with TRAFFIC USA in seeking
to strengthen the control in the trade in whole and partial skins. Therefore, the Service is proposing in this notice
a revised special rule that would replace the present &sect;17.42(c) and that is significantly different from the
proposed special rule accompanying the proposed rule to reclassify the Nile crocodile. The presently proposed special
rule removes the requirement to keep track of each CITES crocodilian skin tag number through the product manufacturing
process and to record the CITES tag numbers on the export permits issued for crocodilian products, but adds provisions
designed to supplement the provisions of the universal tagging system being implemented by the CITES Parties. A discussion
of the special rule and of the CITES tagging resolution is presented in a later paragraph on ``Description of Proposed
Special Rule.''

Conservation measures provided to foreign species listed as endangered or threatened under the ESA include recognition,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the ESA, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions that are to be conducted within
the United States or on the high seas, with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened
and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency
cooperation provision of the ESA are codified at 50 CFR part 402.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, as amended, requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund,
or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a proposed Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must
enter into formal consultation with the Service. With respect to the Nile crocodile or to the saltwater crocodile
in Australia, no Federal activities are known that would require conferral or consultation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, sections 4(d) and 9 of the ESA and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 (which incorporate certain
provisions of 50 CFR 17.21) set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that generally apply to all threatened
wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States
to take, import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale
in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,
or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service, the National
Marine Fisheries Service, and State conservation agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving threatened wildlife species
under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.32. With regard to threatened
wildlife, a permit may be issued for the following purposes: scientific, enhancement of propagation or survival,
economic hardship, zoological exhibition or educational purposes, incidental taking, or special purposes consistent
with the ESA. All such permits must also be consistent with the purposes and policy of the ESA as required by section
10(d). Such a permit shall be governed by the provisions of &sect;17.32 unless a special rule applicable to the wildlife
(appearing in &sect;&sect;17.40 to 17.48) provides otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although threatened species are generally covered by all prohibitions applicable to endangered species, under
section 4(d) of the ESA, the Secretary may propose special rules if deemed necessary and advisable to provide for the
conservation of the species. The rule proposed to be included in &sect;17.42 would allow commercial importation
into the United States of certain farm-raised specimens of Australia's saltwater crocodile population, specimens
of this species from Papua New Guinea, and certain specimens of Nile crocodile populations downlisted to Appendix
II by CITES Parties under ranching or quota provisions as provided for by CITES.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States would allow import only of those specimens or parts or products authorized to be exported under CITES.
In addition, the proposed special rule would not allow trade in such species with countries that are not parties to
CITES, that have taken reservations for crocodilian species under CITES, that do not make required annual reports
to the CITES Secretariat, that have failed to designate Management Authority(s) and Scientific Authorities, or
that do not adequately control illegal trade in crocodilian species. Importation of parts of saltwater crocodiles
directly from Australia or Papua New Guinea, or parts of Nile crocodiles directly from countries with Appendix II
populations would also be allowed under certain circumstances, if the country of origin implements provisions of
the universal tagging system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
International trade in certain crocodilians has presented significant problems for the Parties; several resolutions
have been adopted at previous meetings of the Parties in an effort to establish management regimes to benefit the conservation
of the species. The United States, in conjunction with Australia, Italy, and Germany submitted a resolution to the
CITES Secretariat that was adopted at the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties in Kyoto, Japan (March 2&hyph;13,
1992). This resolution (Conf. 8.14) calls for a universal tagging system for the identification of crocodilian skins
in international trade. Furthermore, in accordance with resolution Conf. 8.14, the Animals Committee at its July
1992 and September 1993 meetings adopted resolutions recommending additional practices for tracking and monitoring
tags.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aspects of this resolution dealing with imports into the United States are incorporated into this proposed rule,
and U.S. implementation of this resolution for import, export, and re-export for all crocodilian species will be
incorporated into a future revision of 50 CFR part 23. Adherence to the new marking requirements should reduce the
potential for substitution of illegal skins and reduce the trade control problems with the similarity in appearance
of skins and products among different species of crocodilians.

identification of crocodilian skins (Conf. 8.14) requires, in part: (1) The universal tagging of raw and processed
crocodilian skins with non-reusable tags for all crocodilian skins entering trade or being re-exported, unless
substantial processing and manufacturing has taken place;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That such non-reusable tags include as a minimum the International Organization for Standardization two-letter
code for the country of origin, a unique serial identification number, a species code and the year of production, and
further that such non-reusable tags have as a minimum the following characteristics: a self-locking system, heat
resistance, inertia to chemical and mechanical processing, information that has been applied by permanent stamping
[These requirements have been further specified by the CITES Animals Committee and, as a result, the Secretariat
has identified manufacturers in three countries that are producing CITES-acceptable tags] and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the same information as is on the tags [for whole skins, flanks, bellies, and ``chalecos''] be given on the
export permit, re-export certificate or other Convention document, or on a separate sheet which shall be considered
an integral part of the permit, certificate or document and which should be validated by the same issuing authority;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That each Party in which tags are applied maintain records accounting for tags issued and maintain records that
relate each Convention document number to the tags of the crocodilian specimens traded thereunder and vice versa,
and include this information in its annual report; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) That Parties establish, where legally possible, a system of registration or licensing, or both, for importers
and exporters of crocodilian skins and parts thereof.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule allows trade through intermediary countries, i.e., all countries of re-export by definition,
for Nile and saltwater crocodiles as long as such countries are effectively implementing CITES and they have adopted
certain management measures to control trade in crocodilian skins and products. Countries are not considered as
countries of re-export if the specimen remains in customs control while transiting or being transshipped through
the country and provided those specimens have not entered into the commerce of that country. The special rule is intended
to complement and strengthen the universal crocodilian tagging system as presently envisioned in CITES resolution
Conf. 8.14 and the implementing resolutions prepared by the CITES Animals Committee. These measures include effective
inspection of shipments to determine if the CITES country-of-origin tag is intact for skin imports and exports and
implementing a monitoring system that relates goods produced to tagged skins received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this special rule is to address the monitoring measures in the countries of re-export in order to have
a more accountable system for the transfer and processing of skins and products in the commercial crocodilian trade.
The United States is a major importer of crocodilian products produced by countries of re-export. The Service inspections
of importations have revealed a continuing pattern of commingling and misidentification of crocodilian leathers.
Accompanying CITES documents have often declared the merchandise as American alligator when the product contains
some species of crocodile, or as crocodile, when the goods are made from American alligator hide. The new CITES tagging
system will represent a significant step towards eliminating misidentification of skins as they leave the country
of origin. Since all American alligator skins are tagged upon export from the country of origin, the problems of commingling
of alligator and crocodile clearly arise during the tanning and manufacturing process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there are several species of crocodiles throughout Africa and Asia that remain listed as endangered.
While identification of crocodile versus alligator can be made consistently in manufactured products, species
identification of crocodile products is more difficult. Despite these difficulties, various species of endangered
crocodilians have been identified in products declared as American alligator or non-endangered crocodiles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This special rule is proposed with the goal of ensuring adequate control in the manufacturing countries to deter intermingling
of the protected populations of the Nile and saltwater crocodiles, as well as the endangered populations of other
crocodiles and alligators without imposing the overburdensome requirement of tracking each piece through the production
process, and recording all incoming tag numbers on the re-exporting permit for products. The new CITES tagging system
does not require that country of origin tags remain intact up to the point of manufacture. Since the commingling problems
described above principally arise in the re-exporting countries, the special rule is designed to address these problems,
to fulfill the ESA's criteria for the protection of threatened species and those with similar appearance, and to allow
trade within the parameters outlined below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed special rule requires that a system for monitoring skins be implemented by the countries of re-export,
so that the transaction history is provided, that inventory controls are maintained by the manufacturer, and that
unmarked skins in re-exporting countries will not be allowed in trade after a specific period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, this special rule is written to allow the Service to respond quickly to changing situations that result
in lessened protection to the crocodilians. Thus, the criteria described in the special rule establish non-discretionary
bases for determining whether CITES provisions are being effectively implemented. Therefore, imports into the
United States can be prohibited after publication of a notice of information on any country that fails to comply with
the requirements of the special rule. For those additional situations outside of the ones set forth in the special
rule, which involve a judgment as to whether necessary trade controls are being implemented, the Service will go through
a separate proposed rule and comment process before reaching a final decision on any trade bans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate rule-making proposal, the Service will propose implementation of the CITES tagging system for all crocodilians.
The rule proposed here will adopt the CITES-approved tags as the required tag for all saltwater and Nile crocodile
skins or partial skins being imported into or exported from any re-exporting country if the skin is eventually imported
into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule is designed to allow trade in saltwater and Nile crocodile skins and products from designated populations
without the need to obtain a threatened species import permit. Tagged skins may be imported from the country of origin
or any CITES-member country of re-export as long as the involved countries comply with certain criteria. Crocodilian
products may be imported without individual tags, provided the involved countries comply with criteria described
for products. The proposed rule provides several criteria for ensuring that countries of origin and re-export have
implemented controls to monitor transactions in crocodilian skins and products and have a satisfactory enforcement
and CITES implementation history. If a country fails to meet the criteria in the proposed rule, notice to that effect
will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and skins and products from Nile and saltwater crocodiles will not be able to be imported into the United States without
the threatened species import permits required in Part 17.

Section-by-Section Description. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule at &sect;17.42(c)(1) contains definitions of ``crocodilian skin'' and ``crocodilian product.''
A ``crocodilian product'' is an item that is fully manufactured and ready for retail sale without further processing.
A ``crocodilian skin'' is any whole or partial skin, and thus includes skins that have been salted, crusted, tanned
or partially tanned or otherwise processed, e.g., dyed, shaved, polished, or filled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(2) stipulates those ESA prohibitions that apply to the saltwater crocodile from Australia and
Papua New Guinea and the Nile crocodile. All ESA prohibitions apply to other saltwater crocodile populations. In
addition, primarily commercial trade is prohibited for specimens from those saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile
populations listed in CITES Appendix I, and non-commercial imports or exports of specimens from Appendix I populations
require a CITES permit issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3) describes exceptions to prohibitions stipulated in &sect;17.42(c)(2); specifically subparagraphs
(i) and (ii) describe the exceptions for skins and products, respectively, provided the country of origin and all
countries of re-export are in compliance with the criteria described in subparagraph (iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(A) provides that each crocodilian skin bear an intact, uncut tag from the country of origin,
with the CITES-required number in compliance with 50 CFR part 23. When chalecos are traded, the two halves of any individual
chaleco shall be tagged so that if the halves are separated each half bears a tag. Skins may be cut in the country of origin
(for instance into flanks or tail and body pieces) but each piece must be separately tagged when it leaves the country
of origin. Since it is impossible for skins currently present in re-exporting countries to be tagged by their country
of origin, the special rule provides for a period of twelve months after publication of the final rule, for such skins
to be imported as skins or products without the trading history requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(B) requires that the information on each tag in a shipment be given on the accompanying
CITES export permit, re-export certificate or other Convention document, or on a separate sheet validated by the
same issuing authority as described in CITES Animals Committee's resolution adopted at its September 1993 meeting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(C) requires that for each crocodilian skin the importer or exporter shall provide a copy
of each CITES permit or certificate or identify the CITES permit/certificate number from the country of origin and
each country of re-export on the permit or on a separate sheet. The transaction history will assist in verifying that
the skins have moved through countries meeting the criteria of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii). Such information is now available
only through the time-consuming process of querying each country in turn to trace its document files to determine
the underlying importation record for any CITES document it has issued. Since commercial traders of skins and products
record and reflect the country of origin for all shipments at present and will have to keep track of skin tag numbers
under the CITES resolution, this provision simply requires that the sellers track the CITES certificate numbers
or transmit copies of these documents from their buyers. This provision is in keeping with the Animals Committee resolutions
calling on re-exporting countries to implement an administrative system for the effective matching of imports and
re-exports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(i)(D) requires that the country of origin and the countries of re-export be in compliance
with the criteria of paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A)&hyph;(iii)(F) and provides that countries meeting these criteria
will be named in a Notice of Information published by the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii) sets forth the conditions for import, export, and re-export of crocodilian products.
While it has frequently been suggested that the only absolutely reliable method for ``cradle to grave'' or ``harvest
to consumer'' control is individual product tagging, the Service is not proposing such measures at this time. If the
skin tagging inspection programs and criteria for evaluating whether party countries are implementing CITES responsibly
are followed, and inventory controls are conscientiously implemented by the re-exporting country government and/or
private sector, the Service hopes that more stringent measures for manufactured products will not be necessary to
control commingling of illegal crocodilians. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii)(A) requires that for each crocodilian product the importer or exporter shall provide
a copy of each CITES permit or certificate or identify the CITES permit/certificate number from the country of origin
and each country of re-export of the skins included in the product, except that such importation history does not need
to be provided for any portions of a product which is 9 square inches or smaller. This provision is similar to the provision
for skins in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C), except that this provision exempts small pieces of skin from the importation
history requirement. The exception for pieces 9 square inches or smaller will permit items generally made from scraps,
such as watch bands, pieced belts, or trim, to be exempt from the importation history requirement. It must be emphasized,
however, that manufacturers still must accurately identify all species of wildlife contained in any importation.
Since many violations have been detected with the misuse of crocodilian skins on the gussets of handbags or trim on
shoes, manufacturers are still urged to maintain vigilance over their inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(ii)(B) requires that the country of origin and the countries of re-export be in compliance
with the criteria in subparagraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A)&hyph;(F) and provides that countries meeting these criteria
will be named in a Notice of Information published by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes that to achieve a reliable system for the manufacture of crocodilian products from lawful skins
and to be able to accurately identify what crocodilian the product was produced from, there must be effective CITES
implementation by the party countries, including rigorous inspection of the tagged skins at each international
transaction and removal from commerce of any skins not bearing an intact tag from the country of origin, and requirements
for manufacturers who receive the tagged skins (regardless of the number of intermediaries the skins have passed
through) to maintain sufficient internal production controls over their inventory so they can account for the quantity
of items they produce from each tagged skin. Paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(F)(

Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(A) provides that each country of origin and each country of re-export be a member of CITES
and not have entered into any reservations for any species within the Order Crocodylia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs 17.42(c)(3)(iii) (B) and (C) require that no notices have been received by the Service indicating that
the CITES Parties or the CITES Secretariat (based on action by the Convention's Standing Committee) has determined
that the country of origin or any country of re-export does not have adequate domestic legislation to enforce the Convention,
that it has failed to properly implement the Convention, or that a moratorium on trade with that country is recommended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iii)(D) requires that the countries of origin and re-export submit their annual reports

countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

) require each country of origin and country of re-export to certify to the Service's Office of Management Authority
that it has the legal authority to inspect and seize or refuse entry for unlawful shipments of crocodilian skins and
products imported into or exported from that country and that it actually inspects no less than 40 percent of the crocodilian
shipments imported into the country for compliance with the CITES tagging and document requirements. Further, these
countries must certify that they require that crocodilian skins cannot be imported or exported without intact, uncut
tags from the country of origin. If a tag has become separated during processing or tanning, that skin may be utilized
in that country's domestic market. The premise behind this provision is the recognition that the CITES tagging requirement
will work only if it is strictly enforced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-exporting countries. Therefore, every piece of crocodilian skin which is not manufactured into a finished product
(and which exceeds 9 square inches in area) must bear an intact country of origin tag upon import and export. If the tags
are intact through all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-exporting countries, then they should be intact at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture so that the manufacturer can maintain an accurate inventory control system.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires that if the country exporting or re-exporting is a country of manufacture, it must certify that it requires
a monitoring system that records tag numbers of skins received and relates the goods produced to the skins received.
The proposed rule does not specify the exact parameters of a particular inventory control system. The Service encourages
Party countries and the industry to explore established programs that have been in place for a number of years, as well
as innovative technologies, such as bar code marking, or other approaches, to develop workable means to maintain
accountability for products manufactured from tagged skins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(iv) allows for the importation of crocodilian skins and parts directly from those countries
where the Nile crocodile populations are on Appendix II of CITES or for saltwater crocodile populations in Australia
or Papua New Guinea, provided the requirements of 50 CFR parts 13, 14, and 23, including those provisions implementing
the CITES resolution on the universal tagging system, are complied with. A direct import does not require routing
directly from the country of origin, as long as the specimen remains under customs control and merely transits through
a third country. Airway bills or shipping documents should indicate that the consignee/purchaser is located in the
United States, as shipments that enter the stream of commerce in a third country are not included under this provision
of the special rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(3)(v) stipulates that no 50 CFR part 17 permits will be required for products of Nile crocodile
and saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea when imported into or exported from the United States
as non-commercial accompanying personal baggage. However, trophies, skins, parts, and products acquired in those
countries whose populations of saltwater or Nile crocodile populations are on CITES Appendix I, will require CITES
import permits, issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 17.42(c)(4) stipulates that if a country of origin or re-export fulfills the criteria in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii)(A&hyph;F),
the Service will publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 informing the public to this effect, and the Service will implement these criteria by requiring compliance with the
Part 17 permit requirements for any skins or products that originated in or have been imported or exported through
any country not included on the approved list. A list of those countries that have met all criteria will be available
from the Service's Office of Management Authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The degree of endangerment of the many crocodilian species varies by species and specific populations. Some crocodilian
species and populations are listed on Appendix I of CITES, and the remaining species and populations are included
in Appendix II. Some species are listed as threatened or endangered on the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife,
while other species are not included. In addition, actions have been taken by several countries to protect their wild
populations but allow trade in specimens bred or raised in captivity under appropriate management programs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, trade in specimens from some populations is not detrimental to the wild population, and commercial trade is
allowed under CITES with proper export permits from certain countries of origin and re-exporting countries. The
Service's concern has been that trade in non-endangered species has in the past provided the opportunity for specimens
of the endangered species or populations to be commingled with legal trade, especially during the manufacturing
process. Numerous U.S. law enforcement actions as well as past actions by the CITES Parties attest to this concern.
The underlying premise behind this special rule is that the current management systems for the Appendix II populations
of Nile crocodile with assigned export quotas and the Australia and Papua New Guinea populations of saltwater crocodile
are being sufficiently sustained to support controlled commercial use; the key risk to these populations as well
as other similar-appearing crocodilians, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate controls in the countries of re-export, especially in those countries in which manufacturing occurs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CITES Parties have adopted and are in the process of implementing provisions of a universal tagging system for
crocodilian skins, and the Service supports these efforts. Adherence to the new marking requirements should reduce
the potential for substitution of illegal skins and reduce the trade control problems with the similarity in appearance
of skins and products among different species of crocodilians. Further, this proposed special rule contains other
steps designed to ensure that the United States does not become a market for illegal trade in crocodilian species and
to encourage other nations to control illegal trade. With the requirement that all skins are to be tagged up to the country
of manufacture, and that manufacturers maintain records concerning the products produced from the tagged skins
they receive, as well as document the chain of transactions preceding their acquisition of the skins, it is hoped that
there will be greater accountability and accuracy in the manufacturing of crocodilian skins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the proposed special rule allowing limited trade in these saltwater crocodile and Nile crocodile populations
should provide incentives to maintain wild populations, as well as encourage all countries involved in commerce
in crocodilian species to guard against illegal trade.

Saltwater Crocodile. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Allowing import of farm-raised specimens is expected to benefit the conservation of wild populations. Under Australia's
conservation program, eggs or hatchlings are removed from the wild for crocodile farm operations under an approved
management program, and wild populations are carefully monitored. Should any decline occur in the wild populations,
the program would return a greater number of 1-year-old captive raised crocodiles to the wild than would have survived
to that age in the wild had no eggs or hatchlings been removed. Limited trade with the United States would provide economic
incentives for conserving wild populations and their habitats, owing to the dependence on them as the source of eggs.
Careful regulation of take and the prescription of specific corrective actions ensure that crocodile farming activities
will not cause declines of wild populations, and have the added potential of reversing declines caused by other factors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under this proposed special rule, parts or products of both the Australian and Papua New Guinea crocodile
populations imported into the United States must be identified in accordance with the CITES marking system for crocodile
skins and parts (refer to section on marking, and provisions of special rule). These marking requirements should
ensure that only legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken specimens are traded, and thus should also benefit the conservation of the species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The appropriateness of the original endangered listing under the ESA and Appendix I listing under CITES has been the
subject of much international debate. However, improvements in the status of Nile crocodile populations and their
management have prompted the CITES Parties to transfer 11 national populations to Appendix II. The proposed downlisting
to a ``threatened'' status does not end trade controls for the species. The species remains in Appendix II of CITES
with export permits required. The proposed special rule should strengthen adherence to the CITES marking scheme
for crocodilian skins as well as compliance with other CITES trade control provisions. Allowing commercial importation
into the United States from CITES-approved countries is expected to benefit the species by encouraging proper conservation
practices and by promoting adherence to the CITES marking system.

Effects of the Proposed Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule, if made final, would change the status of the saltwater crocodile in Australia from endangered
to threatened, and treat the saltwater crocodile in Papua New Guinea as threatened because of similarity of appearance
so that the regulations specifically pertaining to threatened species (50 CFR 17.31, 17.32, 17.51, and 17.52) would
apply to it. A special rule is proposed with this rule to amend 50 CFR 17.42 to allow the importation, under certain conditions,
of whole and partial skins, and finished products thereof of Nile crocodile, which was previously reclassified as
threatened (58 FR 49870), and saltwater crocodile that originate in Australia and Papua New Guinea, without a threatened
species import permit for individual shipments otherwise required by 50 CFR part 17, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
if
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 all requirements of the special rule are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importation of skins and other parts of Nile crocodile from countries where this species is listed in Appendix II of
CITES and of the saltwater crocodile from Australia and Papua New Guinea will be allowed without part 17 permits only

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1437r) (the ``1937 Act'') was enacted to encourage
increased resident management of public housing projects *&blank;*&blank;* ``to promote formation and development
of resident management entities.'' The Department implemented section 20 by regulations (24 CFR part 964 for Public
Housing, and 24 CFR part 905, subpart O for Indian Housing), that governed tenant participation and resident management
in public/Indian housing under Section 20 of the 1937 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Overview of Public Housing Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several weaknesses in the regulations have interfered with successful program implementation. The current regulations
fail to establish clear and detailed policy on resident participation and guidance on the structure for public housing
resident organizations. Additionally, the current regulations fail to establish specific requirements for resident
involvement in public/Indian housing management, and a strong partnership between the PHAs/IHAs (thereinafter
referred to as HAs) and resident councils. Internal conflict between competing resident councils in a development
poses serious problems to HUD with respect to program eligibility and participation, as well as HA recognition. The
Department is concerned about the need to provide more details on how resident councils/resident management corporations
should be structured and how to broaden tenant involvement in public housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes the need to increase the amount of cash contributions for resident council activities,
presently limited at three (3) dollars per unit per year, and to compensate resident council officers who are serving
as volunteers in the public housing community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary asked a former top HUD official to develop policy recommendations on the role of residents in the management
of public housing. Based on these recommendations, the Secretary established an Interim Resident Advisory Committee
consisting of representatives of regional and state resident organizations who developed a Policy Paper on resident
involvement in public housing. Public Housing Advocacy Groups: Public Housing Authorities Directors Association
(PHADA), Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA) and National Association of Housing Redevelopment
Officials (NAHRO), were given an opportunity to review and comment on the Policy Paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20 authorizes funds for technical assistance and training to resident councils (RCs)/resident management
corporations (RMCs) to promote increased resident management of public housing. HUD's experience in providing
grants to RCs/RMCs under the Public Housing Resident Management Program has revealed that major changes were needed
in the provisions of the program. RCs/RMCs and HAs across the country overwhelmingly requested revamping of the program
to assist in meeting their residents' need for economic development, education, job training and development, social
services, and opportunities for other self-help initiatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recommendations from the Interim Resident Advisory Committee on Tenant Involvement in Public Housing, and requests
for changes in the Resident Management Technical Assistance Program resulted in the proposed comprehensive revision
of 24 CFR part 964.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The major changes in the proposed rule would allow for broader, more flexible programs aimed at increasing the capacity
of resident entities to participate significantly in all aspects of public housing operations while simultaneously
permitting further economic uplift opportunities, to the extent permitted under section 20 of the United States
Housing Act of 1937. Section 20 requires that all activities funded under it be related to improved living conditions
and public housing operations. (See &sect;&sect;905.967 and 964.205.) The Department is now proposing amendments
to section 20 to permit funding of a broader range of tenant development activities to include activities that are
not necessarily related to resident management or housing authority operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulation on the Tenant Participation and Resident Management Program is proposed to be renamed ``Tenant
Participation and Tenant Opportunities in the Public Housing Program.'' The proposed regulations would include
the Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP), which replaces the Resident Management Program under subpart C in the current
regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised program was created in response to requests from resident councils/resident management corporations
and HAs across the country for a more flexible program to address the needs in their communities related to encouraging
increased resident management activities as a means of improved living conditions and public housing operations.
The revised program is designed to prepare residents to experience the dignity of meaningful work; to own and operate
resident businesses; to move toward financial independence; to enable them to choose where they want to live; and
to assure meaningful participation in the management of their housing developments. The authority for the TOP program
comes from section 20 of the 1937 Act, which discusses resident management of public housing. Section 20(f) authorizes
technical assistance and training. Financial assistance in the form of technical assistance grants is provided
by the Secretary to RCs/RMCs to prepare for management activities in their housing development (hereinafter referred
to as TOP technical assistance grants). Technical assistance grants are available for ``the development of resident
managed entities, including the formation of such entities, the development of the management capability of newly
formed or existing entities, the identification of the social support needs of residents of public housing projects
and the securing of such support.'' TOP technical assistance grants can enable residents to manage their developments
or portions of their developments. The results are significant and multifaceted. For example, resident managed
activities have resulted in economic development, resident self-sufficiency, improved living conditions, and
enhanced social services for residents (e.g., child care and other youth programs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Resident Management Program would continue to be an option to resident councils/resident management corporations
who are interested in performing management functions in one or more projects of a HA. None of the requirements for
the resident management program will be changed. However, some of the provisions are being moved to other regulations,
or HUD documents. For example, the requirements under subpart C (&sect;964.39) governing the operating subsidy,
budget, operating reserves, etc. are proposed to be moved to 24 CFR Part 990_Annual Contributions for Operating Subsidy.
The Department believes these provisions of &sect;964.39 are more appropriately placed in that regulation. Also,
the requirements for the RMC management contract contents are being removed from subpart C and are contained in HUD
Notice PIH 93&hyph;56 (HA) which also includes a model management contract. This contract must be followed unless
HUD approves a requested change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart A would be expanded to add policies on partnerships between HAs and residents. For example, HAs are required
to provide a duly elected resident council office space and meeting facilities, free of charge, for the purposes of
conducting resident activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the section on definitions (&sect;964.7) would be amended by removing terms such as ``resident council'' and
``resident management corporation'' and expanding the definition of these terms to provide clarity on the eligibility
of a voting member of the resident council and establish the frequency of elections for resident management corporations.
The definitions for other terms such as ``project'' and ``tenant participation'' are eliminated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current rule under subpart B would be expanded substantially to establish policies and procedures for HAs with
respect to resident participation activities. For example, HAs shall provide any funds they receive for resident
participation activities to the duly elected resident council. Parts 990 and 905, subpart J would be amended to require
an ``add-on'' of $25 per unit per year to the HA's operating subsidy calculation, which would be paid to the HA only if
appropriations were available for that purpose, to support activities of the duly elected resident council. The
HUD Circular HM 7475.9 dated February 10, 1992, authorized funds not to exceed three ($3) dollars per unit per year.
The Department believes that an increase of $22 per unit per year is reasonable and, if available, would guarantee
the resources necessary to create a bonafide partnership among the duly elected resident council and the HA. Strong
partnerships are critical for achieving mutual goals contained in this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, HUD proposes to encourage HAs to provide stipends in an amount up to $200 per month/per officer to resident council
officers who serve as volunteers in the public housing development to carry out these duties and functions as officers
of the resident council. The Department believes that these volunteers should be reimbursed for their expenses related
to volunteer efforts, such as child care, transportation, special equipment, clothing, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current part 964 regulations lack specificity regarding resident elections and organizational policies, and
have made it difficult to determine what is a duly elected resident council and that has caused conflicts among the
residents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would add new policies and procedures for resident councils by defining what is a duly elected
resident council, detailing minimum standards for elections of resident councils and specifying the relationship
between the resident councils and resident management corporations. Resident councils would be required to meet
HUD's election standards in order to receive official recognition from the HA and HUD, as well as to receive funds in
conjunction with the conduct of resident council business. The role of the jurisdiction-wide resident council would
be established under the proposed rule. The rule also contains provisions that expand the resident participation
requirements to strongly support resident participation in all aspects of a HA's management operations and that
give rights to residents to freely organize and represent their interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would add a new subpart D to implement the Family Investment Center (FIC) Program under section 22
of the 1937 Act (42 U.S.C. 1437t) (added by section 515 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act).
The FIC program provides families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities.
This new subpart will be added to part 964 to include FIC because it complements the Department's resident participation
and self-sufficiency initiatives. The program was proposed by a national association on behalf of numerous housing
authorities. Representatives from public/Indian housing authorities, resident councils/resident management
corporations and nonprofit housing agencies were convened at the Department to discuss program provisions and provide
policy recommendations during the initial program planning stage. Some HAs will combine their FIC and Family Self-Sufficiency
(FSS) programs. This rule would provide that section 8 FSS Program participants are eligible to participate in the
FIC program when it is combined with FSS, but that income exclusions that are provided to public housing residents
participating in employment training and supportive service programs would not apply to Section 8 FSS families.
The treatment of the FSS escrow account for public housing FIC/FSS families is not addressed in this proposed rule,
but will be included in the final rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;964.320 provides HUD policy on training, employment and contracting of public/Indian housing residents
under section 3 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1968. Section 915 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 made significant changes to section 3. HUD recently published a proposed rule implementing those changes
(see 58 FR 52534, October 8, 1993). Section 3, as amended, requires that HAs make their best efforts, consistent with
existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, to amend contracts for work to be performed in connection
with development, operation and modernization assistance provided pursuant to sections 5, 9 and 14 of the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937. As amended, section 3 establishes an order of priority to which the HA's efforts must be directed. Thus,
the first level of priority is to residents of the housing development, for which the assistance is provided. This
proposed rule includes provisions consistent with the proposed section 3 rule.

The reader should note that combination terms such as ``tenant and resident'', ``tenant council,'' and ``resident

may be used interchangeably. Hereafter, for ease of discussion, the proposed rule will use the terms resident, resident

IV. Amendments of the Tenant Participation and Tenant Opportunities Program in Public Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Regulatory Actions: 964
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on recommendations of the Interim Resident Advisory Committee, program experience, and comments from various
Housing Interest Groups, the regulations are proposed to be revised to: (1) Expand tenant participation in various
programs and involvement in public housing operations, and (2) change the Resident Management Program to the Tenant
Opportunities Program (TOP), and (3) add a new subpart D to the 964 regulations which contains policies and procedures
for the FIC Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section discusses each of the specific regulatory revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Subpart A would be amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Section 964.1 Purpose would be streamlined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Section 964.3 Applicability and scope would remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Section 964.7 Definitions would be amended by removing several definitions such as project and tenant participation;
by moving terms such as Resident Council and Resident Management Corporation to a more appropriate section under
subpart B, and by expanding definitions; and by adding new terms which relate to the FIC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Section 964.11 HUD policy on tenant participation would be amended to strongly support tenant participation in
all the functions of a HA's management operations and give rights to residents to freely organize and represent their
interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Section 964.12 HUD policy on Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP) would provide HUD's policy on the Tenant Opportunities
Program. Subpart C of the current regulation would be changed from ``Resident Management Program'' to ``Tenant Opportunities
Program'' (TOP). The name is being changed to TOP because it reflects the evolution of the program over time, to enhance
resident capacity in a variety of ways, including job training, economic development, and self-sufficiency activities
carried out by resident councils/resident management corporations in public housing. Resident management is a
component of TOP and resident councils/resident management corporations may continue to engage in activities relative
to public housing management. Tenant opportunities programs are proven to be effective in facilitating economic
uplift as well as in improving the overall conditions in public housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Section 964.14 HUD policy on partnerships would be added to provide HUD policy on Partnerships between HAs and residents.
Strong partnerships between HAs and resident councils/resident management corporations are key to the success
of program objectives, and critical for achieving specific and mutual goals and creating positive change for residents
in public housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Section 964.15 HUD policy on resident management would remain unchanged. This section states HUD's support for
resident councils/resident management corporations who are interested in becoming resident managed entities
in public housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Section 964.16 HUD role in activities under this part_Monitoring would be added to describe HUD's proactive responsibility
for promoting tenant participation and tenant opportunities in public housing. It provides that HUD will monitor
program progress to ensure efficient and effective operations pursuant to this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Section 964.18 HA role in activities under subparts B&amp;C would establish a stronger HA role under this subpart.
HAs shall, upon request, provide office space to a duly elected resident council and shall negotiate in good faith
usage of community space for meetings and other activities for residents. HAs have a responsibility to negotiate
such usage of space with the duly elected resident council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Section 964.24 HUD policy on FIC program would provide HUD's policy and support for the FIC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subpart B would be amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Section 964.100 Role of resident council which establishes the role of a resident council and Section 964.105 Role
of the jurisdiction-wide resident council which establishes the role of a jurisdiction-wide resident council would
be added to the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Section 964.110 Resident membership on HA Board of Commissioners would encourage resident membership on HA Board
of Commissioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Section 964.115 Resident council requirements would describe the provisions necessary for the Resident Council
to receive official recognition from the HA and HUD. In the current rule, this provision was included in the definitions
section, and in this proposed rule it becomes a separate section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Section 964.117 Resident council partnerships would be added to encourage and promote partnerships between the
resident councils and public/private organizations. While the Department encourages partnerships to complement
council activities, such organizations must not become the governing entity of the resident council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Section 964.120 Resident management corporation requirements would establish characteristics in order to receive
formal recognition by the HA and HUD. In the current rule, this was included in the definitions sections and in this
proposed rule, it becomes a separate section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Section 964.125 Eligibility for resident council membership would be added to provide guidance on eligibility
for council membership. This section establishes that any member of a household, who is on the lease, may be a member
of a resident council. However, in order to be a voting member of the resident council, a person's name must appear on
the lease of a unit in the public housing development, and he/she must be: (1) A legal head of household (means the member
of the family who is the head of the household for purposes of determining income eligibility and rent), or (2) 18 years
of age or older. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Section 964.130 Election procedures and standards would be added to provide minimum standards for resident council
elections including the requirement for supervision by an independent third party. HAs shall monitor the resident
council's elections to ensure compliance with HUD's minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Section 964.135 Resident involvement in HA management would be added to provide policy on resident involvement

of a HA operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Section 964.140 Resident training would be added to encourage HAs to take the lead in providing training opportunities
for public housing residents. If residents are willing, they may receive training from the HA and become involved
in implementing various Federal programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Section 964.145 Conflict of interest would be added to provide policy on resident council officers serving as contractors
or as employees of a HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Section 964.150 Funding tenant participation would be added to establish policy on funding duly elected resident
councils. Subject to appropriations, HAs shall provide funds to the duly elected resident council for tenant participation
activities. This rule also proposes amendment to 24 CFR part 990 for tenant services to include up to $25 per unit per
year, subject to the availability of appropriations, as an add-on to the Performance Funding System (PFS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Subpart C would be amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the TOP program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Section 964.220 Technical assistance would describe HUD's commitment to fund TOP activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the performance of management functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Section 964.230 Audit and administrative requirements would provide audit and administrative guidelines for
recipients of TOP grant funds and resident management corporations contracting with a HA for management responsibilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Subpart D would be added to the part 964 as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Section 964.300 General would provide the purpose and program provisions of the FIC program. FIC provides families
living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency
and independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Section 964.305 Eligibility for FIC would provide eligible activities and requirements under the FIC program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Section 964.315 HAs role in FIC activities under this part would provide the process required to assure that HA residents
are informed about FIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Section 964.320 HUD policy on training, employment, contracting and subcontracting of public/Indian housing
residents under FIC would state HUD's policy on resident training, employment and contracting under FIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Section 964.325 Announcement of funding availability for FIC would indicate that the Notice of Funding Availability
(NOFA) will be published periodically and contain specific information regarding eligibility, funding criteria,
etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Section 964.330 Grant set-aside assistance for FIC would state HUD's policy of permitting up to five percent (5%)
of amounts available in any fiscal year to augment grants previously awarded under this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Section 964.335 Grant agreement for FIC would provide the grant agreement term.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
j. Section 964.340 Resident compensation for FIC would provide guidelines governing employment compensation under
this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Section 964.45 Treatment of income would provide provisions for income exclusions for any resident participating
in the FIC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Indian Housing Changes_Part 905 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also revises 24 CFR part 905, subpart O, ``Resident Participation and Opportunities''. The Indian
housing section is similar to its public housing counterpart, but does not contain some of the provisions in 24 CFR
part 964 in an effort to streamline the regulations and tailor them specifically to the generally smaller size of most
Indian Housing Authorities (IHA). However, all activities, functions and benefits permitted under any public housing
resident programs will remain eligible activities, functions and benefits for Indian housing resident programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major changes in the proposed rule will allow for broader, more flexible programs aimed at increasing the capacity
of Indian housing resident organizations and resident management corporations to carry out their organizational
functions in a more structured manner while simultaneously permitting further economic uplift opportunities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the subpart there is a general section; a Tenant Opportunities Program (TOP) section; and a Family Investment
Centers Program section. The current Indian Housing Resident Management Program under existing regulations is
viable and remains an option under TOP. None of the requirements for the resident management program will be changed;
however, some sections are being moved to other sections of the 905 regulations or HUD handbooks.

C. Miscellaneous Conforming Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes that have been made to other parts are the exclusion from income of stipends to RC officers and of training grants
under the FIC program that would be added to 905 and 913; the provision for payments to duly elected resident council
officers, and the inclusion of requirements governing the RMC Operating subsidy, budget, operating reserves, etc.,
that would be made to 990; and changes for the resident participation subpart that would be made in part 905 to parallel
changes in part 964.

Justification for Shortened Comment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the general practice of the Department to provide a 60-day comment period on all proposed rules. However, the
Department is shortening its usual 60-day comment period to 30 days because it would be contrary to the public interest
to delay the benefits of the rule another 30 days and because it is unnecessary to have a longer comment period. The policies
contained in this proposed rule are the result of collaborative efforts with various housing interest groups, i.e.,
public housing resident leaders, Public/Indian Housing Authorities, Public Housing Advocacy Groups. This should
decrease the need for the usual time period for comment, since consultation took place while the policy was being developed.

The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule
before publication and by approving it certifies that this proposed rule does not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule provides substantial revisions to the regulations concerning
Tenant Participation and Management in Public Housing under which resident councils/resident management corporations
receive funding on a competitive basis. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact on small entities since
resident councils/resident management corporations will continue to obtain by contract technical assistance
to carry out program activities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on states or their political
subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution of power
and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the proposed rule is not subject to review
under the order. The revised proposed rule is consistent with federalism principles since it reduces unnecessary
burdens on resident organizations. Since participation by resident organizations is discretionary, this proposed
rule lacks the direct and substantial effects on resident organizations required for a policy with federalism implications
under the Order.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
proposed rule has a beneficial effect on the family, and thus, does not require further review. No significant change
in existing HUD policies or programs will result from promulgation of this proposed rule, as those policies and programs
relate to family concerns.

The Department has estimated the public reporting burden involved in the information collections contained in the
proposed rule as shown below. The public reporting burden for each of these collections of information is estimated
to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

Calculation of operating subsidy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

subsidy computation will be the same as the separate computation made for the balance of the projects in the HA in accordance
with subpart J of this part, with the following exceptions: (1) The project managed by a resident management corporation
will have an Allowable Expense Level based on the actual expenses for the project in the fiscal year immediately preceding
management under this subpart. These expenditures will include the project's share of any expenses which are overhead
or centralized HA expenditures. The expenses must represent a normal year's expenditures for the project, and must
exclude all expenditures which are not normal fiscal year expenditures as to amount or as to the purpose for which expended.
Documentation of this expense level must be presented with the project budget and approved by HUD. Any project expenditures
funded from a source of income other than operating subsidies or income generated by the locally owned Indian housing
program will be excluded from the subsidy calculation. For budget years after the first budget year under management

in accordance with subpart J of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The resident management corporation project will estimate dwelling rental income based on the rent roll of the
project immediately preceding the assumption of management responsibility under this subpart, increased by the
estimate of inflation of resident income used in calculating PFS subsidy.

(3) The resident management corporation will exclude, from its estimate of other income, any increased income directly
generated by activities of the corporation or facilities operated by the corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

management corporation to HUD for approval. This budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify
which expenditures are related to the responsibilities of the resident management corporation and which are related
to functions which will continue to be performed by the HA.

(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operating reserves. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart
and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the resident management corporation
will have transferred, into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the host HA, an operating reserve. Where all
maintenance responsibilities for the resident-managed project are the responsibility of the corporation, the
amount of the reserve made available to projects under this subpart will be the per unit cost amount available in the
HA operating reserve, exclusive of all inventories, prepaids and receivables (at the end of the HA fiscal year preceding
implementation), multiplied by the number of units in the project operated in accordance with the provisions of this
subpart. Where some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the resident management corporation,
the contract may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the
corporation's sub-account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The use of the reserve will be subject to all administrative procedures generally applicable to the Indian housing
program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve will be for eligible expenditures which are incorporated into
an operating budget subject to approval by HUD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 of the Financial
Management Handbook, 7475.1 REV, and interest generated will be included in the calculation of operating subsidy

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements for a management specialist. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a resident council or resident management corporation seeks to manage a development, it must select, in consultation
with the HA, a qualified housing management specialist to assist in determining the feasibility of, and to help establish,
a resident management corporation and to provide training and other duties in connection with the daily operations
of the project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;964.225 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Resident management requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following requirements apply when a HA and its residents are interested in providing for resident performance
of several management functions in one or more projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident management corporation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Resident councils interested in contracting with a HA must establish a resident management corporation that meets
the requirements for such a corporation, as specified in subpart B. The RMC and its employees must demonstrate their
ability and skill to perform in the particular areas of management pursuant to the management contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HA responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAs shall give full and serious consideration to resident management corporations seeking to enter into a management
contract with the HA. A HA shall enter into good-faith negotiations with a corporation seeking to contract to provide
management services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duty to bargain in good faith. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a HA refuses to negotiate with a resident management corporation in good faith or, after negotiations, refuses
to enter into a contract, the corporation may file an informal appeal with HUD, setting out the circumstances and providing
copies of relevant materials evidencing the corporation's efforts to negotiate a contract. HUD shall require the
HA to respond with a report stating the HA's reasons for rejecting the corporation's contract offer or for refusing
to negotiate. Thereafter, HUD shall require the parties (with or without the direct HUD participation) to undertake
or to resume negotiations on a contract providing for resident management, and shall take such other actions as are
necessary to resolve the conflicts between the parties. If no resolution is achieved within 90 days from the date HUD
required the parties to undertake or resume such negotiations, HUD shall serve notice on both parties that administrative
remedies have been exhausted (except that, pursuant to mutual agreement of the parties, the time for negotiations
may be extended by no more than an additional 30 days). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management contract
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A management contract between the HA and a resident management corporation is required for property management.
The HA and the resident management corporation may agree to the performance by the corporation of any or all management
functions for which the HA is responsible to HUD under the ACC and any other functions not inconsistent with the ACC
and applicable state and local laws, regulations and licensing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procurement requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The management contract shall be treated as a contracting out of services, and must be subject to any provision of a
collective bargaining agreement regarding the contracting out of services to which the HA is subject. Provisions
on competitive bidding and requirements of prior written HUD approval of contracts contained in the ACC do not apply
to the decision of a HA to contract with a RMC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibited activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A HA may not contract for assumption by the resident management corporation of the HA's underlying responsibilities
to HUD under the ACC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Bonding and insurance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before assuming any management responsibility under its contract, the RMC must provide fidelity bonding and insurance,
or equivalent protection that is adequate (as determined by HUD and the HA) to protect HUD and the HA against loss, theft,
embezzlement, or fraudulent acts on the part of the resident management corporation or its employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver of HUD requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the joint request of a resident management corporation and the HA, HUD may waive any requirement that HUD has established
and that is not required by law, if HUD determines, after consultation with the resident management corporation and
the HA, that the requirement unnecessarily increases the costs to the project or restricts the income of the project;
and that the waiver would be consistent with the management contract and any applicable collective bargaining agreement.
Any waiver granted to a resident management corporation under this section will apply as well to the HA to the extent
the waiver affects the HA's remaining responsibilities relating to the resident management corporation's project.

(a) The project managed by a resident management corporation will have an Allowable Expense Level based on the actual
expenses for the project in the fiscal year immediately preceding management under this subpart. These expenditures
will include the project's share of any expenses which are overhead or centralized PHA expenditures. The expenses
must represent a normal year's expenditures for the project, and must exclude all expenditures which are not normal
fiscal year expenditures as to amount or as to the purpose for which expended. Documentation of this expense level
must be presented with the project budget and approved by HUD. Any project expenditures funded from a source of income
other than operating subsidies or income generated by the locally owned public housing program will be excluded from
the subsidy calculation. For budget years after the first budget year under management by the resident management
corporation, the Allowable Expense Level will be calculated as it is for all other projects in accordance with &sect;990.105(e)(5).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Subject to &sect;990.403 of this section, the amount of funds provided by a PHA to a project managed by a resident
management corporation under this subpart may not be reduced during the three-year period beginning on February
5, 1988 or on such later date as a resident management corporation first assumes management responsibility for the
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) For purposes of determining the amount of funds provided to a project under &sect;990.402(a) of this section,
the provision of technical assistance by the PHA to the resident management corporation will not be included.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The resident management corporation and the PHA shall submit a separate operating budget, including the calculation
of operating subsidy eligibility in accordance with &sect;990.401 of this section, for the project managed by a resident
management corporation to HUD for approval. This budget will reflect all project expenditures and will identify
which expenditures are related to the responsibilities of the resident management corporation and which are related
to the functions which will continue to be performed by the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Each project or part of a project that is operating in accordance with the ACC amendment relating to this subpart
and in accordance with a contract vesting maintenance responsibilities in the resident management corporation
will have transferred, into a sub-account of the operating reserve of the host PHA, an operating reserve. Where all
maintenance responsibilities for the resident-managed project are the responsibility of the corporation, the
amount of the reserve made available to projects under this subpart will be the per unit cost amount available to the
PHA operating reserve, exclusive of all inventories, prepaids and receivables (at the end of the PHA fiscal year preceding
implementation), multiplied by the number of units in the project operated in accordance with the provision of this
subpart. Where some, but not all, maintenance responsibilities are vested in the resident management corporation,
the contract may provide for an appropriately reduced portion of the operating reserve to be transferred into the
corporation's sub-account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The use of the reserve will be subject to all administrative procedures applicable to the conventionally owned
public housing program. Any expenditure of funds from the reserve will be for eligible expenditures which are incorporated
into an operating budget subject to approval by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Investment of funds held in the reserve will be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 of the Financial Management
Handbook, 7476.1 REV.1 and interest generated will be included in the calculation of operating subsidy in accordance
with this part.

(a) Operating subsidy calculated in accordance with &sect;964.401 will reflect changes in inflation, utility rates
and consumption, and changes in the number of units in the resident management project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In addition to the amount of income derived from the project (from sources such as rents and charges) and the operating
subsidy calculated in accordance with &sect;990.401 of this subpart, the contract may specify that income be provided
to the project from other sources of income of the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The following conditions may not affect the amounts to be provided to a project managed by a resident management
corporation under this subpart: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any reduction in the total income of a PHA that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the PHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any income generated by a resident management corporation that exceeds the income estimated for the income category
involved as specified in the RMC's management contract must be excluded in subsequent years in calculating: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The operating subsidy provided to a PHA under part 990 subpart A of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The funds provided by the PHA to the resident management corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The management contract must specify the amount of income expected to be derived from the project (from sources
such as rents and charges) and the amount of income to be provided to the project from the other sources of income of the
PHA (such as operating subsidy under part 990 subpart A of this chapter, interest income, administrative fees, and
rents). These income estimates must be calculated on a PHA-wide basis, as well as for each category of income on which
the PHA and the resident management corporation agree, consistent with HUD's administrative instructions. Income
estimates may provide for proration of anticipated project income between the corporation and the PHA, based upon
the management and other project-associated responsibilities (if any) that are to be retained by the PHA under the
contract.

Any revenues retained by a resident management corporation under &sect;990.404 of this subpart may only be used for
purposes of improving the maintenance and operation of the project, establishing businesses enterprises that employ
residents of public housing, or acquiring additional dwelling units for lower income families. Units acquired by
the resident management corporation will not be eligible for payment of operating subsidy.

Notice is hereby given that the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) Institute of Medicine (IOM), through its Food
and Nutrition Board (FNB), will conduct the first of two public meetings to obtain additional perspectives about
the scientific base for the nutrition risk crtieria used in the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants,
and Children (WIC). Eligibility for WIC is based in part on nutrition risk. Through a grant from the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the NAS is reviewing the scientific base for nutrition
risk criteria used in WIC. At the end of the 30-month study, NAS will publish a report and provide copies to FNS containing
its conclusions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NAS, through IOM's FNB, formed the Committee on Scientific Evaluation of WIC Nutrition Risk Criteria (committee)
in October 1993 to examine the scientific base for determining nutrition risk criteria used in the WIC program. The
WIC program operates through a preventive approach to health care by providing supplemental foods and nutrition
assessment and education to improve nutritional status and thus to improve pregnancy outcome and growth and development
of infants and children (through 5 years of age). The program links food assistance and health programs by its goal
of improving nutritional status through food delivery and by serving as a gateway to the public health system principally
through Medicaid-delivered health services for pregnant and lactating women, for infants, and for children. Eligibility
for the WIC program is based on income (185 percent of poverty level); status as a pregnant or lactating woman, an infant,
or a child; and nutritional risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nutrition risk criteria include biochemical and anthropometric measurements, nutritionally related medical
conditions, dietary deficiencies that impair or endanger health, and conditions that predispose persons to inadequate
nutrition patterns or nutritionally related medical conditions. The appropriateness of nutrition risk criteria
is an issue of major interest to the WIC community and of great significance to the future direction of the program.
The committee deliberations will address these issues, thereby providing a basis for establishing approriate guidance
for nutrition risk criteria used to establish program eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committee will review all WIC nutrition risk factors currently covered by the program. The committee's deliberations
will begin with those risk criteria for which there is substantial scientific literature and move to those for which
there is little or no scientific literature, that are most difficult to quantify, or that are not likely to be affected
by the supplemental food package delivered through the program. NAS plans to identify gaps in scientific knowledge,
to examine specific segments of the WIC population identified to be at risk for each criterion, and if applicable,
to report its findings regarding how to determine who is at risk for each criterion, including numerical values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public meetings will solicit information from WIC program administrators, staff, and participants as well as from
researchers in the fields related to the nutrition risk criteria under study. Two public meetings will be conducted
during the course of the committee's work, both in 1994. This first public meeting will be held in Washington, DC. A
second public meeting will be schedule at an upcoming meeting of the committee in 1994 at the NAS west-coast meeting
facility, the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center, Irvine, California. A report of the committee's findings and recommendations
will be published by the end of the study in April 1996.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;Part, from China surged to 3,004,237
square meters in 1993, double the 1,433,201 square meters imported in 1992. China is the second largest supplier of
cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;part, to the U.S. market, accounting for 21 percent
of total imports in 1993. In 1992, China ranked third among the major suppliers, accounting for 12 percent of total
imports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sharp and substantial increase of Category 224&hyph;Part imports from China is causing a real risk of disruption
in the U.S. market for cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. production of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;Part, declined from 52,134,000
square meters in 1989 to 44,243,000 square meters in 1992, a decline of 15 percent. Production continued to decline
in 1993, falling to 32,867,000 square meters during January-September 1993, 4 percent below the January-September
1992 level. In contrast, U.S. imports of cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics, Category 224&hyph;Part, nearly
doubled, increasing from 6,063,000 square meters in 1989 to 11,638,000 square meters in 1992. Imports of cotton and
manmade fiber woven pile fabrics continued to increase in 1993, reaching 14,456,512 square meters, 25 percent above
the 1992 level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. producers' share of the market for cotton and manmade fiber woven pile fabrics fell from 90 percent in 1989
to 73 percent during January-September 1993, a decline of 17 percentage points. The ratio of imports to domestic production
more than tripled during the same time period, increasing from 12 percent in 1989 to 37 percent during January-September
1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed interim remedial action at WAG 5 at ORNL, prepared in accordance
with 10 CFR part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetlands Involvement was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 [58 FR 51624 (October 4, 1993)] and a floodplain assessment was completed; no wetlands are involved in the proprosed
action. DOE is proposing to capture and treat ground water that is emanating from Seep Area D as a means of reducing the
amount of strontium-90 (90Sr) being discharged into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Melton Branch, which contributes between 10 and 15 percent of the total amount of 90Sr that passes over White Oak Lake
Dam and enters the Clinch River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is comprised of the following three components: (1) A collection component consisting of a collection
structure; (2) in-ground treatment component using pipelines to carry ground-water discharge to and from a treatment
chamber for capture of the 90Sr in the ground-water discharge; and (3) a pumping and trucking component using a pipe
transfer line to a truck transfer station for removal of ground-water discharge that has not been effectively treated
for 90Sr removal. Proposed activities associated with the Seep Area D interim removal action would involve less than
a quarter of an acre of the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek. The proposed action is not expected to adversely
impact the floodplain or measurably change flood levels. Rather, the proposed action would have an overall positive
effect on the environment and human health by reducing the amount of radioactive contaminants entering the riverine
environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed activities associated with Seep Area D interim remedial action include extending an existing gravel
road in the floodplain by about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
150 feet to gain access to the seep area and installing a collection structure, a supply pipeline to, and discharge
pipeline from, a treatment chamber located outside of the floodplain, a pipe transfer line to a truck transfer station
also located outside of the floodplain, and a single power pole. During construction, a temporary dam, diversion
pump, and flexible pipe would be installed in the floodplain to divert stream water around the construction site.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection structure would consist of a gravel bed located under Melton Branch to intercept the ground-water
discharge, a concrete cover to isolate the gravel bed from Melton Branch, and pumps and piping for transferring the
discharge water to either the treatment chamber or truck transfer station. A different structure, but of similar
design, would be installed if final field monitoring data indicate that such a structure would better divert and collect
the ground-water discharge. Regardless of final design, the effects of any such structure on the floodplain would
be negligible. Ground-water discharge in the seep area would be collected in the gravel bed and pumped either to the
treatment chamber or a truck transfer station. The treatment chamber would contain an ion-exchange medium to remove
90Sr. (An ion-exchange medium is a chemical compound, such as zeolite, that selectively adsorbs 90Sr, thereby removing
this radionuclide from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground-water discharge.) Upon entering the treatment chamber, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground-water discharge would pass through the ion-exchange medium and then be released to Melton Branch. Pumping
to the truck transfer station would take place if the ion-exchange medium does not remove sufficient 90Sr (the criteria
for removal has been established at 90 percent as measured from water samples taken from the treatment chamber supply
and discharge pipelines). Tanker trucks would transfer the ground water from the storage tank to the ORNL Process
Waste Treatment Plant for processing. The Process Waste Treatment Plant is an existing, permitted facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action has been designed to avoid or minimize impacts to the floodplain; negligible adverse impacts
to the floodplain are expected to occur as a result of taking the proposed action. Best management practices would
be strictly adhered to for all proposed activities. Sediment control measures, such as silt fences and diversion
ditches would be used. Excavated soil would be sampled to determine the level of contamination, if any. To minimize
the possibility of any contaminated soil entering the nearby creeks, contaminated soil would be disposed of according
to ORNL construction guidelines. Where possible, disturbed areas would be graded to preconstruction contours,
seeded, and allowed to return to their natural state. Construction is estimated to take between 3 and 5 months. Construction
activities would be scheduled during the dry season and would be substantially reduced and curtailed during unfavorable
weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several alternatives to the proposed action were considered, including no action, in-ground treatment without
a pipe transfer line to a truck transfer station, collection and transfer to the Process Waste Treatment Plant by tanker
truck without in-ground treatment, collection and transfer to the Process Waste Treatment Plant by pipeline without
in-ground treatment, and on-site treatment. The no-action alternative was deemed least desirable because of the
release of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
90
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sr from the seep area since continued release would not be protective of human health and the environment. The other
alternatives were excluded on the basis of efficiency, implementability, and cost. Effects upon the floodplain
would not be measurably reduced under any of the other alternatives to the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action has been designed to avoid or minimize impacts to the floodplain and no significant adverse impacts
to the floodplain are expected to occur. The proposed action does conform to applicable State floodplain standards.
DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy announces that, pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance
award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to the National Governors' Association (NGA) under
proposed Cooperative Agreement Number DE-FC01&hyph;94EW30330. The total estimated funding in the amount of $3,136,517
will be provided to NGA for this effort. NGA currently has an agreement with DOE to facilitate site treatment plan approval
by States and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by providing a forum for regulators to review and discuss
technical policy and implementation issues concerning site plans and to actively participate in the development
of these plans. Funding for the proposed agreement will allow NGA to conduct reviews of DOE conceptual and draft site
treatment plans, participate in discussions with DOE on related Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 (FFCAct)
issues, and review other related documents not specifically required by the legislature, but having a bearing on
the site treatment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) that NGA's unique institutional
ties to the State governments included in this project are required because of the need to balance individual State
interests with national perspectives in the development of DOE's mixed waste treatment plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGA is the only organization that collectively represents all of the nation's Governors on matters of national and
State policy. This organization's ability to access and mobilize its member governments on multi-state task forces
and committees is needed to provide assessment of key issues identified in the FFCAct and facilitate issue resolution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NGA's Center of Policy and Research has substantial expertise in Federal and State environmental programs and
hosting forums for identifying and resolving critical policy and implementation issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 DE&hyph;FC02&hyph;89ID12905, GTRC developed an optical sensor for real time detection of ammonia. The original
application was to monitor ammonia transfer from agricultural croplands, and thereby reduce the amount of nitrogen
fertilizer used; however, PSS has determined that the sensor can also facilitate the use of ammonia in a variety of
industrial applications such as large scale refrigeration where the use of ammonia as the refrigerant has efficiency
advantages in many applications. PSS proposes to continue development of the sensor through commercial prototype
and evaluation of this prototype in full-scale agricultural and industrial settings.

DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
to the satisfactory completion of, and is a continuation of, an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which
competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity and satisfactory completion of the
activity. Also, PSS the new participant, now has the exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully
based on the recent acquisition of both the critical patent rights and technical expertise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE funding for the proposed activity is estimated to be $451,000 and PSS's share is estimated to be $426,000 for a total
of $877,000 over a three year project period.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Foreign Operations Appropriations Act of 1994 contains a provision (section 575) designating $35,000,000 for
a ``Ukraine/Russia Stabilization Partnerships Program.'' The Secretary of Energy has been charged with the implementation
of the program, which allowed for the inclusion of the other New Independent States (NIS), and is now referred to as
the ``NIS Industrial Partnering Program.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program will have two principal components. Both are intended to assist NIS institutes with converting from defense
to commercial applications thereby reducing the potential for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
The first component is designed to engage the scientists and engineers at key technical and scientific institutes
of the NIS in non-defense activities. This component is an expansion of unclassified cooperative non-defense research
and development activities that have been conducted for some time between individual DOE National Laboratories
and individual NIS institutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second component is designed to assist in stabilizing the NIS technical and scientific infrastructure, to encourage
the commercialization of NIS technologies, and promote the development in the NIS of market-oriented economies.
A number of cost-shared international industrial partnerships will be formed, each involving at least one DOE National
Laboratory, one NIS institute, and at least one U.S. industrial entity, whose contribution to the success of the partnership
will be critical. A significant portion of the U.S. Government contribution to support the program is intended for
NIS institutes to spur follow-on trade and investment by U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1993, DOE sponsored a meeting, involving representatives from the National Laboratories and representatives
of U.S. private sector entities with experience in NIS-to-U.S. technology transfer and commercialization. As a
result of that, and subsequent meetings, it was concluded that a program of commercial industry-selected partnerships
to invest in NIS technologies would be facilitated if a consortium of U.S. private sector entities could be established.
The Secretary of Energy would then enter into a cooperative agreement with such a consortium, using the authority,
and under the terms set out in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the National Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act
of 1989, the Cooperative Research Act of 1984, and other applicable statutes. The consortium would be required to
give special attention to the needs of small businesses under the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Take notice that on March 30, 1994, Koch Gateway Pipeline Company (Koch Gateway) tendered for filing a revised report
of refunds. The refund report supersedes the previous filing made on February 22, 1994. Such report was submitted
in compliance with Section VI(C) of the Joint Stipulation and Agreement filed September 30, 1991 and approved by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission'') by order issued October 22, 1991. The revised refund report
corrects an allocation, error found in the February 22, 1994, filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koch Gateway states that the total dollar amount was correct, however, individual shippers were allocated erroneous
amounts. The previous filing inadvertently had included discounted MDQ's for a variety of shippers. The revised
refund report shows the correct allocation and the net effect on all customers. Additionally, in accordance with
&sect;154.67(c)(2)(iii) of the Commission's Regulations, interest is included on the refund amounts as reflected
on revised Appendix A to the filing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 22, 1993, the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
of America-UAW (UAW) petitioned EPA under section 21 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), 15 U.S.C. 2620, to
issue test rules under section 4 of TSCA to develop data to aid in the determination of whether machining fluids pose
an unreasonable risk to public health or the environment. This Notice announces EPA's response to UAW's petition.

I. Summary of Petition and Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 22, 1993, EPA received a petition under section 21 of TSCA from UAW. The petitioner subsequently agreed
at EPA's request to extend the statutory deadline for EPA review until April 12, 1993. The petitioner requested that
EPA issue test rules under section 4 of TSCA to evaluate whether machining fluids pose an unreasonable risk to public
health or the environment. UAW requests the testing because it believes that although the available epidemiology
data is sufficient to establish the hazards of machining fluids as mixtures, more and better toxicology data is needed
to characterize the health and environmental risks resulting from exposure to particular components or partial
mixtures of machining fluids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner alleges that sufficient evidence exists to establish that occupational exposure to machining fluids
at currently permissible levels poses a risk of cancer and adverse effects on respiratory function. UAW says that
the information derived from the additional testing requested, including measurements of environmental release
in the occupational setting, would contribute to refining control strategies. It asserts that such information
would more clearly define the toxicity of specific components constituting machining fluids and of different combinations
of those components. The petitioner also believes that additional testing data will provide needed information
regarding workplace exposure to specific components or partial mixtures of machining fluids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner does not identify the specific chemical substances or chemical mixtures for which testing is requested.
UAW states that the petition applies to all machining fluids, including generic categories such as straight oils,
soluble oils, and synthetic fluids, and drawing compounds for metal stamping which are similar in composition to
machining fluids. EPA estimates that the UAW petition potentially applies to hundreds of chemical substances or
mixtures of chemical substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner says that test rules issued in response to the petition should include, but not be limited to requiring:
mutagenicity, respiratory irritancy, and sensitization bioassays of machining fluid components, partial combinations
and in-use machining fluids; carcinogenesis bioassays for selected classes of components; chemical analysis of
bulk fluids and aerosols for nitrosamines, bacterial degradation products (including endotoxin) and higher molecular
weight polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon formation from use; and health effects studies. In addition, the petitioner
requests test rules requiring measurement of release to the environment of various machining fluid components to
gauge workplace exposure from airborne machining fluid components.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 9, 1993, UAW petitioned the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) to lower the current
OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for oil mist from machining fluids. The UAW petition to OSHA includes a request
that OSHA approach EPA to determine the need for test rules for particular ingredients of metalworking fluids, using
authority under TSCA. The UAW petition to OSHA, a copy of which was filed with the TSCA section 21 petition, is accompanied
by a paper entitled ``Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Machining Fluids,'' which contains a summary of
selected epidemiological studies of cancer and respiratory diseases among workers exposed to machining fluids.
In a statement made at the time of the filing, UAW president Owen Bieber said that additional joint union-company studies
are underway at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, and that within a few years, study sponsors will know far more about,
among other things, what specific ingredients in machining fluids are causing health problems for workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that additional testing of machining fluids may be necessary to adequately characterize the health
effects of these fluids on exposed workers. However, EPA has decided that it is not in a position at this time to conclude
that the requisite section 4 criteria have been met for the hundreds of chemical substances and mixtures to which the
petition arguably applies. Before deciding to require testing of machining fluids, EPA will work with OSHA and the
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in a specially convened Interagency Workgroup to identify
specific components of machining fluids, the combinations in which these chemical substances are used in the workplace,
and the level of workplace exposure to these chemical substances, and then determine which chemical substances,
if any, have been adequately tested in the past or are currently undergoing testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, before imposing testing requirements, EPA must determine which machining fluid chemicals meet the
section 4 standards for presenting potentially unreasonable risks or evidencing adequate release or exposure to
require testing under TSCA. A more detailed discussion of these standards is contained in Unit II.A. of this Notice.
EPA anticipates that it will be able to complete the phase of this process that will result in decisions on whether to
initiate section 4 test rules within 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the last several years, EPA has also taken a number of additional initiatives as described in Unit IV of this Notice.
These activities help to address potential adverse health effects on workers exposed to machining fluids.

A. Statutory Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 21 of TSCA provides that any person may petition EPA to initiate proceedings for the issuance of rules under
sections 4, 6, and 8 of TSCA. A section 21 petition must set forth the facts which the petitioner believes establish
the need for the rules requested. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days. If EPA grants the petition,
the Agency must promptly commence an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, the Agency must publish
its reasons in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Within 60 days of denial, the petitioner may commence a civil action in a U.S. district court to compel the initiation
of the rulemaking requested in its petition. The court must, for a petition for a new rule, provide an opportunity for
the petition to be considered 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After hearing the evidence, the court can order EPA to initiate the action requested if the petitioner has demonstrated,
by a preponderance of the evidence, support for particular conclusions described in section 21. In a challenge to
an EPA denial of a section 21 petition requesting a section 4 rule, the petitioner would have to demonstrate by a preponderance
of the evidence that information available to the Agency is insufficient to permit a reasoned evaluation of the effects
of a chemical substance or mixture, and that the chemical substance or mixture either may present an unreasonable
risk of injury or will be produced in substantial amounts and may result in significant or substantial human exposure
or substantial environmental release, and that testing is necessary to characterize the risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 21 does not provide specific direction as to how the Agency should evaluate a citizen's petition, but merely
states that EPA must grant or deny within 90 days. However, there are standards under section 4 for issuing regulations,
and in determining whether to grant or deny, EPA must consider whether the requirements for section 4 rulemaking can
be met. Under section 4 of TSCA, EPA may issue rules to require chemical manufacturers and processors to test the chemical
substances and mixtures (chemicals) that they produce. To issue a section 4 rule on a chemical, EPA must find either
that activities involving the chemical may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment, or
that the chemical is or will be produced in substantial quantities and that there is or will be significant or substantial
human exposure to the chemical or that the chemical is or will be released to the environment in substantial quantities.
In addition, EPA must find that existing data are insufficient to determine or predict the effects of the chemical
and that testing is necessary to develop that data. EPA must be able to make all of the above findings to issue a test rule;
if EPA believes on the basis of the information obtained from the petition, and from its investigation during the 90&hyph;day
review period, that it cannot make all of the necessary findings, EPA will deny the section 21 petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the criteria most relevant to a section 21 petition is whether testing is necessary. Section 4 expands the concept
of sufficiency provided in the section 21 standards established for the purposes of district court review, requiring
that EPA find that testing a chemical is necessary to develop the data needed to evaluate the chemical before it may
issue a rule requiring testing of that chemical.

B. Description of Machining Fluid Problems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Machining fluids, also called metalworking fluids, are used to lubricate and cool industrial equipment and the metal
being shaped during a variety of machining operations. These may include metal removing operations such as cutting
or drilling, metal forming such as stamping or drawing, or similar operations. In its petition to OSHA, UAW states
that NIOSH estimates that up to 10 million U.S. workers are routinely exposed to oil mists from machining fluids. Exposure
is primarily occupational; however, there are limited exposure data. There may be as many as 400 commercial products
(EPA, 1992) belonging to one of four major metalworking fluid types: straight and soluble oils and semi-synthetic
and synthetic fluids. All but the synthetic fluids contain mineral oil. There are no standard formulations of chemical
components among commercial machining fluids. The following Table 1, which is illustrative only, indicates the
diversity and use patterns of the generic types of machining fluids and components:

UAW attached a list of 14 epidemiology studies to its OSHA petition, along with a general description of the findings
of these studies. Eight studies have been published; the remaining six studies have not been published and presumably
have undergone peer review. These studies covered several operations including grinding operations in which inhalation
of fine particles of the material being machined became a concern, as well as exposures in machining operations that
did not involve grinding. The UAW-represented plants in the studies made a variety of products, using different processes
with different machining fluid compositions and presumably different exposure levels. Taken together, the studies
covered workers in foundry and engine plants exposed to substances characterized as straight, soluble, and insoluble
oils, synthetic water-based cutting fluids, other synthetic fluids, cutting oils, metal fumes, abrasives, dusts,
oil smoke, coolants, organic solvents, and nitrosamines. The studies found some evidence of increased risks of esophageal,
rectal, laryngeal and stomach cancer. However, information regarding the level of exposure was limited or lacking
altogether. For example, only two of the studies provided any quantitative measurement of exposure and both measures
were reflective of current rather than historical levels to which workers were exposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to UAW, excess stomach cancers were found in seven of the nine studies conducted at the UAW-represented
plants. Of all 14 studies listed, however, only three studies actually found a statistically significant increased
risk of stomach cancer (Austin et al., unpublished; Park et al. 1988; Silverstein et al. 1988). UAW has commented that
it ``believe[s] that there is sufficient evidence to conclude that exposure to machining fluids poses a risk of occupational
cancer and adverse effects of respiratory health at levels permitted by the current OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit.''
The epidemiology studies are consistent with toxicology studies, which have generally shown that the respiratory
tract is sensitive to the effects of machining fluid exposure. The increased incidence of cancer and respiratory
effects in the epidemiology studies were associated with several types of machining fluid oils.

III. EPA's Approach to Obtaining Information on Workplace Health Risks from Exposure to Machining Fluids
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA agrees with UAW that laboratory work on machining fluids should be expanded and that additional testing may be
needed to more clearly define the toxicity of specific components of machining fluids and of different combinations
of those components. However, EPA is not at this time convinced of the necessity to initiate section 4 test rules under
TSCA for all the more than 400 components of machining fluids and the many hundreds of combinations of those components
that are in use today. EPA believes that before it issues test rules, existing laboratory data must be reviewed to determine
which machining fluid components have already been tested adequately. EPA believes that it is important for OSHA
and NIOSH to help decide, possibly with additional input from both unions and industry, which of the hundreds of untested
or inadequately tested machining fluid components or combinations are most likely to increase health risks to workers
because they appear to have the greatest potential toxicity or are found in the most widely used machining fluids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To select machining fluid chemicals for testing in response to this petition, EPA has recently formed an Interagency
Workgroup with representatives from EPA, OSHA, and NIOSH. This group will review information regarding the composition
of currently-used machining fluids and existing health effects and exposure data on machining fluids, and will recommend
specific chemicals for testing to the OSHA/NIOSH/EPA Committee (ONE Committee).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ONE Committee was established pursuant to a formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 1988 to provide a focal
point for coordination and exchange of information on occupational issues including toxic chemical assessment
and regulatory activities of the three agencies. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) was later added
to the Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following review of the Interagency Workgroup's recommendations for testing (including monitoring) of specific
machining fluid chemical substances or mixtures, the ONE Committee will refer data needs for specific chemical substances
or mixtures to EPA for development of proposed test rules. EPA will then undertake to make the necessary findings under
section 4 and develop test rules covering the recommended substances or mixtures. The identity and number of specific
chemicals referred for testing will depend on the selections of the Interagency Workgroup, as reviewed by the ONE
Committee. EPA has received letters from OSHA and NIOSH officials expressing their approval of the Interagency Workgroup's
formation, appointing representatives to serve on the group, and indicating their understanding that the purpose
of the group is to assist in addressing UAW's concerns regarding occupational health risks associated with exposure
to machining fluids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to receiving the ONE Committee's referral of data needs the Interagency Workgroup's recommendations of substances
or mixtures for testing, and Agency review with regard to section 4 criteria, EPA is not in a position to require testing
for the hundreds of combinations of machining fluid chemical substances (or some subset thereof) which are currently
in use. Specifically, EPA needs to select the chemicals and combinations that will support the findings required
under TSCA section 4 before EPA can promulgate a test rule. In addition to evaluating the toxicity of chemicals and
mixtures found in machining fluids, EPA needs to evaluate the potential exposure that occurs during use. Moreover,
thermal and degradation products, and particulates from the metal work being machined can add to the potentially
toxic exposures. These issues may need further review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that EPA probably cannot promulgate a TSCA section 4 test rule for one category of additives
mentioned in the petition. Section 3 of TSCA excludes certain types of chemicals from the definition of ``chemical
substances,'' and therefore from regulation under TSCA, including chemicals ``manufactured, processed, or distributed
in commerce, for use as pesticides.'' When biocides are added to machining fluids to act as pesticides, they would
not normally be the subject of a TSCA section 4 rule. However, they are regulated by EPA under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) 7 U.S.C. 136 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and EPA has authority to require health and environmental data under FIFRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Agency recognizes that additional laboratory testing may be needed to determine the toxicity of inadequately
tested machining fluids. In addition, studies to better characterize worker exposure to machining fluids may be
needed. EPA agrees with UAW that exposure to toxic machining fluid components and combinations of such components
should be minimized. EPA also agrees with UAW that EPA, OSHA, and NIOSH should work together to determine the need for
TSCA section 4 rules for particular ingredients and mixtures of metalworking fluids. EPA has initiated actions that
will enable EPA, OSHA and NIOSH to navigate through the complex and extremely large universe of machining fluid components
and mixtures to select appropriate substances for testing. The agencies may also seek the assistance of unions and
industry in this effort. EPA believes that consultation with unions and industry may be particularly useful in handling
nomenclature and product definition issues that must be resolved prior to promulgating test rules under section
4.

IV. Specific Actions to Address Workplace Exposure to Toxic Machining Fluid Components
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to receiving the December 22, 1993 petition, EPA had identified machining fluids as a potential source for concern.
EPA had also begun to evaluate the toxicity of these materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 28, 1990, EPA received a letter from Dr. Franklin Mirer of UAW indicating UAW's intent to submit a petition under
TSCA section 21 requesting TSCA section 4 carcinogenicity testing of cutting oil components and formulations. In
response to this letter and a TSCA section 8(e) submission, EPA initiated a review of the toxicity of machining oil
components and mixtures under its screening level risk management process (RM1). After reviewing available data
on oil-based metalworking fluids, EPA concluded on September 9, 1992, that there were insufficient data at that time
to define the agent(s) of concern for toxicity testing, and EPA presented this conclusion to the ONE Committee. As
a result of this review, EPA decided to group machining fluid additives by their use (e.g., anti-oxidants, biocides,
etc.) into use clusters for screening with respect to potential human risk, ecological risk, and pollution prevention.
To date, 11 such clusters have been identified and are under review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the following actions were not contemplated by EPA in response to any UAW initiative. These actions have
been taken previously or are planned unilaterally by EPA to reduce, among other things, workplace exposure to certain
toxic components of machining fluids.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recently completed an investigation of chlorinated paraffins and olefins (CP/Os), substances used extensively
in cutting fluids. Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) came to the attention of EPA in 1977, when the National Toxicology
Program (NTP) nominated them for testing. Earlier that year, an international group of CP manufacturers had formed
a Consortium to test their products for both health and environmental effects. EPA had discussed the planned testing
with the Consortium and had accepted the Consortium's proposal for voluntary health and environmental effects testing
of CPs. Consequently, EPA at that time did not propose a section 4(a) rule requiring such health or environmental effects
testing. Following completion of testing by industry in 1984, EPA tentatively estimated that CPs could pose potential
risks to aquatic life at concentrations at or below the concentrations that might be expected to occur frequently
in the environment. In addition, NTP, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the State of California
had classified short chain CPs as probable human carcinogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In September of 1993, EPA concluded that CP/Os do not present a general environmental risk, although a few cities with
heavy concentrations of metalworking operations were identified in which CP/O water concentrations could reach
levels of concern to some aquatic species. The investigation also concluded that CP/Os may pose cancer risks to specific
limited populations, primarily to workers using metalworking fluids and thus exposed to CP/Os in oil mists. EPA also
concluded that, to a lesser extent, CP/Os also could pose potential cancer risks to small populations of subsistence
fish-eaters in a few metropolitan areas, and possibly to anyone exposed to dioxin that might be generated during metalworking
operations or when spent fluids are incinerated. Consequently, EPA is proposing to list CP/Os on the Toxic Release
Inventory (TRI), based primarily on concerns about potential cancer risks. In addition, EPA has communicated to
OSHA the potential occupational risk to metalworkers at the current PEL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 12, 1993, (58 FR 27944) EPA promulgated a Significant New Use Rule (SNUR) under TSCA for alkali metal nitrites
(AMNs), another frequent machining fluid additive. EPA has determined that the use of AMNs as ingredients in machining
fluids containing amines may result in significant exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-nitrosamines and pose a significant cancer risk to human health. The SNUR applies to any person that manufactures,
imports, or processes AMNs for use as an ingredient in machining fluids containing amines. Such persons must notify
EPA 90 days before undertaking the activity. This time period gives EPA an opportunity to evaluate the intended use
of the AMNs in question to ensure that workers are protected from the risks of exposure to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
N
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-nitrosamines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, to address concerns over environmental releases of machining fluids and components, EPA is planning to
propose the Metal Products and Machinery Phase I Effluent Guideline by November 1994. This guideline, which is scheduled
for promulgation by May 1996, is intended to cover facilities that manufacture, rebuild or maintain metal parts,
products or machines and that discharge effluent to surface waters and indirectly to publicly owned treatment facilities.
The phase I guideline will cover the aerospace, aircraft, electronic equipment, hardware, mobile industrial equipment,
ordnance, and stationary equipment industries. The guideline will regulate discharges of several pollutants,
including some substances that are components of machining fluids or that constitute machining fluids.

Keith A. Caruso, Cornell University. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An inquiry conducted by Cornell University Medical College found that Dr. Caruso, while a medical student in the Department
of Psychiatry, altered, fabricated, and destroyed primary laboratory data while learning techniques for insulin
receptor binding on erythrocytes at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; this work was supported by grants
from the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Caruso admitted to these acts of alteration, falsification and
destruction of primary data. ORI has accepted the university's findings, and Dr. Caruso has signed an agreement with
ORI accepting the finding of scientific misconduct and the administrative actions previously imposed by Cornell
University. This agreement was made final on April 6, 1994. ORI has determined that the university's administrative
actions were sufficient, and has not imposed any further Public Health Service actions. The fabricated data did not
appear in any scientific publications.

John C. Hiserodt, M.D., Ph.D.: An inquiry conducted by the University of Pittsburgh and an investigation conducted
by the Office of Research Integrity found that Dr. Hiserodt deliberately and knowingly falsified four figures and
one table in two research grant applications submitted to the National Institutes of Health, and deliberately and
knowingly fabricated a laboratory notebook to cover-up the falsifications in the grant applications. In reporting
research results on antigen recognition by natural killer cells, Dr. Hiserodt falsely reported that a purportedly
unique protein had a molecular weight of 48 kilodaltons by altering photographs of autoradiograms, falsely reported
that this protein had been found in human cells, falsely reported the results of a gene sequence in response to questions
raised by NIH grant reviewers about his experimental findings, and fabricated a laboratory notebook to cover-up
the falsified research when questions about it were raised by investigating officials. Dr. Hiserodt has been debarred
from receiving Federal grant or contract funds for a period of five years beginning March 9, 1994. In addition, any
institution receiving PHS research support involving Dr. Hiserodt must monitor the accuracy of his research for
an additional two-year period following the five-year debarment (for a total period of seven years) beginning March
9, 1999. He has also been prohibited from serving on PHS Advisory Committees or review groups for seven years beginning
February 25, 1994. Dr. Hiserodt is also required to request correction of the article ``The Expression and Functional
Involvement of Laminin-like Molecules in Non-MHC Restricted Cytotoxicity by Human Leu-19+/CD3-Natural Killer
Lymphocytes,'' Journal of Immunology, Vol. 141, 3318&hyph;23, 1988, to indicate that Figure 2 in the article may
not be relied upon.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) administers national programs for children and youth,
works with States and local communities to develop services which support and strengthen family life, seeks out joint
ventures with the private sector to enhance the lives of children and their families, and provides information and
other assistance to parents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The concerns of ACYF extend to all children from birth through adolescence. Many of the programs administered by the
agency focus on children from low-income families; children and youth in need of foster care, adoption or other child
welfare services; preschool children; children with disabilities; abused and neglected children; runaway and
homeless youth; and children from American Indian and migrant families.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Act of 1986 (the Act), as amended, authorizes
grants to States to assist public and private agencies in developing temporary child care or respite care services
for children with disabilities and crisis nurseries for children who are abused or neglected, at risk of abuse and
neglect, or in families receiving protective services. These programs are intended to maintain and support the family
unit and strengthen the parent-child bond. Programs were funded under this Act in fiscal years 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991,
and 1993. In FY 1992, ACYF funded, through a limited competition, final continuations grants for projects originally
funded in FY 1990.

The priority areas identified in this announcement are derived from legislative mandates as well as Departmental
goals and initiatives. The priorities reflect the state of current knowledge as well as emerging issues which have
come to ACYF's attention by several means including consultation with advocates, policymakers, and practitioners
in the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The priorities seek to focus attention on and to encourage demonstration efforts to obtain new knowledge and improvements
in service delivery for the solution of particular problems and to promote the dissemination and utilization of the
knowledge and model practices developed under these priorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section presents the basic set of issues that must be addressed in the application. Typically, they relate to
project design, evaluation, and community involvement. This section also asks for specific information on the proposed
project. Inclusion and discussion of these items in the applicant's proposal is important since they will be used
by the reviewers in evaluating the proposal against the evaluation criteria. Project products, continuation of
the project effort after the Federal support ceases, and dissemination/utilization activities, if appropriate,
should also be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each priority area is composed of the following sections:

Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act authorizes temporary child care programs for children with disabilities and requires applicants seeking
temporary child care funds to define disabilities using the definition in the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The term children with disabilities means children_(A)(i) with mental retardation, hearing
impairments including deafness, speech or language impairments, visual impairments including blindness, serious
emotional disturbance, orthopedic impairments, autism, traumatic brain injury, other health impairments, or
specific learning disabilities; and (ii) who, by reason thereof, need special education and related services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The term children with disabilities for children aged 3 to 5, inclusive, may at a State's discretion, include children_(i)
experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the State and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments
and procedures, in one or more of the following areas: physical development, cognitive development, communication
development, social or emotional development, or adaptive development; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) who, by reason thereof; need special education and related services *&blank;*&blank;* (Public Law 102&hyph;119)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of establishing a temporary child care program (also known as respite care) for children with disabilities
or who are chronically or terminally ill is to alleviate social, economic, and financial stress among the families
of such children. Such care provides the families or primary caregivers with periods of temporary relief from the
pressures of the demanding child care routine, thus preventing severe family stress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following components may be included in temporary child care or respite care projects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;24-hour services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Access to primary medical services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Referral to counseling/therapy services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Staff training, including child abuse/neglect reporting responsibilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Public awareness programs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Linkages to other family support and/or family preservation services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A crisis nursery is defined in section 42 U.S.C. Section 5117c(d) to mean a center providing temporary emergency services
and care for children. Crisis nurseries are child care facilities which protect children by providing a safe environment
at a time when the chances of neglect or abuse in the home are increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The programs offer parents the option of ``time out'' as a preventive measure in reducing the incidence of child maltreatment.
They are designed to: (1) Develop a safe environment as a resource for children at risk of abuse; (2) deliver non-punitive,
non-threatening services as a resource to caregivers of at-risk children; and (3) utilize existing community-based
services to further diminish the potential for the maltreatment of children in families experiencing crisis. Services
funded under 42 U.S.C. Section 5117b must be provided without fee and may be provided for a maximum of 30 days in any year.
Crisis nurseries must also provide referral to support services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Since 1988, the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded 145 grants to States
to support respite care services and crisis nurseries under the Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities
and Crisis Nurseries Program. Through these State agency grantees, over 250 local service providers have been recipients
of the $52,106,552 awarded thus far. In addition, other projects, not utilizing Federal funds available under this
program, have been developed and implemented in local communities designed to address the needs of similar target
populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993 the Children's Bureau awarded grants to 24 States with funds earmarked for expanding respite care and crisis
nurseries services within the States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respite care programs funded under the Temporary Child Care program are designed to alleviate social, economic,
and financial stress among families of all children and, particularly, children with disabilities or children who
are chronically or terminally ill through the provision of short-term, non-medical child care. Such respite care
provides families or primary care givers with periods of temporary relief from the pressures of the demanding child
care routine, thus preventing severe family stress. Respite care programs generally provide 24-hour services,
access to medical services; referral access to counseling/therapy; staff training, including child abuse/neglect
reporting responsibilities; and public awareness efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crisis Nurseries programs are designed to protect children by providing a safe environment at a time when the chances
of neglect or physical abuse in the home are increased. These programs offer parents the option of time out as a preventive
measure to reduce the incidence of child maltreatment. In general, crisis nursery programs provide many of the same
services as respite care programs but also place greater emphasis on intervention, remediation and prevention services
including referrals for out-of-home placement, when appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other community programs also provide respite care as an integrated part of their services. New legislation recently
established Subpart 2 of Title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act, entitled the Family Preservation and Support
Services, which encourages and enables States to develop, establish or expand and operate programs for family preservation
and community-based family support services. These programs are family-centered and will focus on strengthening
the family unit. Family preservation services will assist families in crisis when the child is at imminent risk of
being placed in out-of-home care because of abuse and/or neglect. Family support services will focus on activities
aimed at increasing the strength and stability of families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing programs vary considerably in terms of quality, experience and methodology. However, the demand for services
is increasing as the number of single-parent families, families in poverty, and stress on families increases; as
fewer disabled children are institutionalized; and as substance abuse impacts greater numbers of children and families.
Additional resources are needed to assist in identifying, developing and utilizing effective program practices,
information and materials in order to meet this demand.

D. Available Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ACYF intends to award new grants and a Cooperative Agreement under this announcement during fiscal year 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications for continuation grants funded under this program beyond the first year's budget period, but within
the total project period, will be entertained in subsequent years on a non-competitive basis, subject to the availability
of funds and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the Federal government. Applicants
are advised that the Administration has proposed the consolidation of this program into the Child Care and Development
Block Grant (CCDBG) beginning in FY 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for priority areas 1.01A and 1.01B, non-competitive funding for subsequent years will be based on a program
staff review of project status and performance, and evidence that the program is part of an integrated system of services
described in an approved State plan as mandated by Title IV&hyph;B, Subpart 2, of the Social Security Act, pursuant
to the Family Preservation and Family Support program. If the Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities
and Crisis Nurseries program is consolidated with CCDBG, ACYF will encourage States to consider continuing those
projects funded under these priority areas. For priority area 1.02, non-competitive funding beyond year three will
be based on the project's responsiveness to customers' needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Part III_Review Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before applications are reviewed, each application will be screened to determine that the applicant organization
is an eligible applicant as specified under the selected priority area. Applications from organizations which do
not meet the eligibility requirements for the priority area will not be considered or reviewed in the competition,
and the applicant will be so informed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Review Process and Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Timely applications from eligible applicants will be reviewed and scored competitively. Experts in the field, generally
persons from outside of the Federal government, will use the evaluation criteria listed in Section C, Evaluation
Criteria, to review and score the applications. The results of this review are a primary factor in making funding decisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ACYF reserves the option of discussing applications with, or referring them to, other Federal or non-Federal
funding sources when this is determined to be in the best interest of the Federal government or the applicant. It may
also solicit comments from ACYF Regional Office staff, other Federal agencies, interested foundations, national
organizations, specialists, experts, States and the general public. These comments, along with those of the expert
reviewers, will be considered by ACYF in making funding decisions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In making decisions on awards, ACYF may give preference to applications which focus on or feature: Minority populations;
programs which are part of an integrated system of family support services and/or family preservation services;
a substantial innovative strategy with the potential to improve theory or practice in the field of human services;
a model practice or set of procedures that holds the potential for replication by organizations involved in the administration
or delivery of human services; substantial involvement of volunteers; substantial involvement (either financial
or programmatic) of the private sector; a favorable balance between Federal and non-Federal funds available for
the proposed project; the potential for high benefit for low Federal investment; a programmatic focus on those most
in need; and/or substantial involvement in the proposed project by national or community foundations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the greatest extent possible, efforts will be made to ensure that funding decisions reflect an equitable distribution
of assistance among the States, and geographical regions of the country, rural and urban areas, and ethnic populations.
In making these decisions, the Assistant Secretary and HHS Senior Staff may also take into account the need to avoid
unnecessary duplication of efforts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Temporary Child Care for Children with Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Program is covered under Executive
Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and 45 CFR Part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department
of Health and Human Services Program and Activities. Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing
and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and territories, except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau, have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established State Single Point of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these 17 jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their
SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions. Applicants
must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC
comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to
the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard
Form 424, item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline to comment on proposed new or competing continuation
awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally,
SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendations
which may trigger the accommodate or explain rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a&hyph;k of Section B.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of funds in fiscal year (FY) 1995
for the Public Health Conference Support Grant Program. The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving
the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity to reduce
morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is related to all of Healthy People 2000
priority areas, except HIV Infection (a separate announcement for HIV entitled, ``Public Health Conference Support
Cooperative Agreement Program for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention'' will be published). (For ordering
a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section ``Where To Obtain Additional Information.'') 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is authorized under section 301 (42 U.S.C. 241) and section 310 (42 U.S.C. 242n) of the Public Health Service
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Smoke-Free Workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote
the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and
mental health of the American people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible applicants include non-profit and for-profit organizations. Thus, universities, colleges, research
institutions, hospitals, other public and private (e.g., community-based, national, and regional) organizations,
State and local health departments or their bona fide agents, federally recognized Indian tribal governments, Indian
tribes or Indian tribal organizations, and small, minority and/or women-owned businesses are eligible for these
grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Availability of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $300,000 is expected to be available in FY 1995 to fund approximately 15&hyph;20 awards. The awards
range from $1,000 to $30,000 with the average award being approximately $15,000. The awards will be made for a 12-month
budget and project period. The funding estimates may vary and are subject to change, based on the availability of funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. CDC funds may be used for direct cost expenditures: salaries, speaker fees, rental of necessary equipment, registration
fees, and transportation costs (not to exceed economy class fare) for non-Federal employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. CDC funds may Not be used for the purchase of equipment, payments of honoraria, alterations or renovations, organizational
dues, entertainment or personal expenses, cost of travel and payment of a Federal employee, nor per diem or expenses
other than local mileage for local participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. CDC funds may Not be used for reimbursement of indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Although the practice of handing out novelty items at meetings is often employed in the private sector to provide
participants with souvenirs, Federal funds Cannot be used for this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. CDC funds may be used for only those parts of the conference specifically supported by CDC as documented in the grant
award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the conference support grants is to provide Partial support for specific non-Federal conferences
in the areas of health promotion and disease prevention information/education programs, (Except HIV Infection).
Applications are being solicited for conferences on: (1) Chronic disease prevention; (2) infectious disease prevention;
(3) control of injury or disease associated with environmental, home, and work-place hazards; (4) environmental
health; (5) occupational safety and health; (6) control of risk factors such as poor nutrition, smoking, lack of exercise,
high blood pressure, and stress; (7) health education and promotion; (8) laboratory practices; and (9) efforts that
would strengthen the public health system. Because conference support by CDC creates the appearance of CDC co-sponsorship,
there will be active participation by CDC in the development and approval of those portions of the agenda supported
by CDC funds. In addition, CDC will reserve the right to approve or reject the content of the full agenda, speaker selection,
and site selection. CDC funds will not be expended for non-approved portions of meetings. Contingency awards will
be made allowing usage of only 10% of the total amount to be awarded until a final full agenda is approved by CDC. This
will provide funds for costs associated with preparation of the agenda. The remainder of funds will be released only
upon approval of the final full agenda. CDC reserves the right to terminate co-sponsorship if it does not concur with
the final agenda. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because CDC's mission and programs relate to the promotion of health and the prevention of disease, disability, and
premature death, only conferences focusing on such programmatic areas will be considered. Those topics concerned
with health-care and health-service issues and areas other than prevention should be directed to other public health
agencies.

concerning such matters as financial holdings, employment, consultancies, and research grants and/or contracts
to permit evaluation of possible sources of conflict of interest.

Selection of representatives of consumer interests will be conducted through procedures that include use of a consortium
of consumer organizations which has the responsibility for screening, interviewing, and recommending candidates
for the agency's selection. Candidates from this group, like all other candidates for membership on the committee,
should possess appropriate qualifications to understand and contribute to the committee's work.

Regarding nominations for members representing industry interests, a letter will be sent to each person or organization
that has made a nomination and to other organizations that have expressed an interest in participating in the selection
process together with a complete list of all such organizations and the nominees. The letter will state that it is the
responsibility of each nominator or organization that has expressed an interest in participating in the selection
process to consult with the others and to provide a consensus slate of possible members representing industry interests
within 60 days. In the event that a slate of nominees has not been provided within 60 days, the agency will select an industry
representative for each such vacancy from the entire list of industry nominees to avoid delay or disruption of the
work of the committee. The agency is particularly interested in nominees that possess the essential scientific credentials
needed to participate fully and knowledgeably in the committee's deliberations. In addition to this expertise,
the agency believes that it would be an advantage to the committee's work if the individual(s) had special insight
and direct experience into specific industry-wide issues, practices, and concerns that might not otherwise be available
to others not similarly situated.

 Lead System is a transvenous defibrillation lead system and is intended for the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias
in patients who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. Such patients are defined as those who have experienced one
or more of the following: (1) Survived at least one episode of cardiac arrest presumably due to hemodynamically unstable
ventricular tachyarrhythmias unassociated with acute myocardial infarction; or (2) recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias
in the absence of such previous arrest and are inducible into sustained hypotensive ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
fibrillation despite conventional antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

 Lead System is that it does not require a thoracotomy. The physician should weigh its advantages against the patient's
ability to withstand additional electrophysiological testing (arrhythmia induction and conversion testing),
and a possible thoracotomy, should the lead system prove ineffective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various factors, such as cardiomegaly or drug therapy, may necessitate repositioning of the defibrillating leads
or substitution of one lead system for another in order to facilitate arrhythmia conversion. In some cases, reliable
arrhythmia conversion may not be obtained with any leads at the available AICD

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing its approval of the application by MBf USA, Inc., Boca Raton,
FL, for premarket approval, under section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), of the AWARE Test
System. The Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology Devices Panel recommendation of approval, with conditions, was made
at a November 4, 1991, panel meeting. Approval was originally sought for over-the-counter (OTC) use by the applicant.
However, FDA has decided that this panel meeting did not consider various issues, and so the panel will resume deliberating
OTC use at a second meeting. As a result of the need for a second panel meeting, the applicant revised the indications
for use to reflect a more limited use. After reviewing the recommendation of the Clinical Chemistry and Toxicology
Devices Panel, FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) notified the applicant, by letter of January
18, 1994, of the approval of the application.

On May 14, 1993, KC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 3220 Producer Way, Pomona, CA 91768, submitted to CDRH an application for
premarket approval of the K&hyph;C Sterile Preserved Saline Solution. The K&hyph;C Sterile Preserved Saline Solution
is indicated for use in the rinsing, heat disinfection, and storage of soft (hydrophilic) contact lenses. The application
includes authorization from Steridyne Laboratories, Inc., 3238 Canyon Lake Dr., Hollywood, CA 90068, to refer to
information contained in its approved PMA and related supplements for STERIDYNE STERILE PRESERVED SALINE SOLUTION.
In accordance with the provisions of section 515(c)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(c)(2)) as amended by the Safe Medical
Devices Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629), this PMA was not referred to the Ophthalmic Devices Panel, an FDA advisory
panel, for review and recommendation because the information in the PMA substantially duplicates information previously
reviewed by this panel.

 Lead System. The device is a transvenous defibrillation lead system and is intended for single long-term use, and
each lead is designed to be used only with a compatible Medtronic, Inc., implantable tachyarrhythmia control device
along with at least one other Medtronic, Inc., defibrillator lead. The lead system has application where implantable
tachyarrhythmia cardioversion or defibrillation systems are indicated. Current medical research indicates that
such patients should: (1) Have survived at least one episode of a cardiac arrest, presumably due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia
as evidenced by resuscitation using a transthoracic defibrillator. The ventricular tachyarrhythmia should not
have been caused by an acute myocardial infarction; or (2) in the absence of a prior cardiac arrest, have poorly tolerated
sustained ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation, which occurs spontaneously, or can be induced,
despite the best antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because of unforeseen circumstances, the availability of the application kit for the funds announced in this NOFA
has been delayed. Therefore, the Department also is extending the deadline for applications accordingly. In addition,
this amendment issues an interpretation that is the result of inquiries following the publication of the NOFA, and
publishes the control number assigned by OMB for the information collection requirements associated with this NOFA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also is announcing that it will be making available from FIC $5 million for a Youth Development Initiative
that will be announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in a separate NOFA. The Youth Development Initiative will be a grant competition under FIC, as a part of ``Operation
Safe Home,'' a major Clinton Administration Initiative that addresses the larger problem of violence in America's
low-income communities. Five $1 million grants will be awarded to Public Housing Authorities for innovative strategies
for curbing crime among youth, and for youth leadership and development programs that will provide young individuals
in public housing with better access to comprehensive education, employment opportunities, and supportive services
to achieve self-sufficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FR Doc. 94&hyph;4413, the NOFA for Public and Indian Housing Family Investment Centers, published
at 59 FR 9592 (February 28, 19942) is amended as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On page 9592, column 1, the paragraph following the heading ``Dates'' is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application kits will be available beginning April 22, 1994. The application deadline will be 4:30 p.m., local time,
on July 22, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On page 9592, column 2, the text following the heading ``Paperwork Reduction Act Statement'' and preceding the

The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget, under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520), and assigned
OMB control number 2577&hyph;0189. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under the heading ``Allocation Amounts'' on page 9592, in the third column, the first sentence of the second paragraph
is amended by revising the total amount of funding available under the NOFA from ``$74 million to ``$69 million'',
and two new sentences are added to the end of the second paragraph, to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department intends to make $5 million available for antiviolence programs that provide education
and employment opportunities for youth in public housing under the Administration's Operation Safe Home Initiative.
A separate NOFA announcing these funds and soliciting applications also is expected to be published soon in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On page 9594, column 1, paragraph (c) under the paragraph heading ``(2) Eligible Activities.'' is revised to read
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The renovation, acquisition, or construction of facilities located near the premises of one or more HA developments
to accommodate the provision of supportive services. Under this NOFA, acquisition and new construction will be treated
the same as substantial rehabilitation (renovation/conversion) activities, for such purposes as ranking and submission
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The preferred alternative presented in the FEIS/FEIR is to construct a new concrete-lined canal parallel to the 23-mile
reach of the existing unlined canal from 1 mile west of Pilot Knob to Drop 3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project is authorized by Public Law 100&hyph;675. The Imperial Irrigation District proposes to construct the
project with funds provided by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) in accordance with Public
Law 100&hyph;675. The conserved water would be utilized by MWD and other California water agencies holding Colorado
River water delivery contracts with the Secretary of the Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental aspects of primary concern are the potential loss of wetlands habitat along the All-American Canal
that have been induced by canal seepage, the loss of terrestrial habitat, and the reduction in the canal fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These potential losses would be mitigated by enhancing unaffected wetlands along the canal, acquiring and protecting
terrestrial habitat, and replacing canal fishery habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FEIS/FEIR presents the preferred alternative and four other alternatives, including the no Federal action alternative,
describes the existing environment and the environmental consequences of project construction, and presents the
proposed mitigation plan. It also documents the comments received during the 90-day public review of the draft environmental
impact statement/draft environmental impact report and presents Reclamation's responses to comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of a meeting of the ACWDPU. The theme of the meeting is ``Water Use and Water Conservation.''
The proposed agenda for the meeting includes a panel discussion on Water Information Needs for Water Use and Water
Conservation. To obtain information on water-resources issues at the local level, the ACWDPU will tour the Orange
County Water District. In addition, Federal and non-Federal officials will present information about the Intergovernmental
Task Force on Monitoring Water Quality (ITFM); the effects of earthquakes and mud slides on water supply and distribution
systems; and other aspects of water-information programs and activities. Also, the ACWDPU will review the recent
activities of the National Water Quality Assessment Council. On Wednesday and Thursday, May 18&hyph;19, 1994, representatives
of the ACWDPU will work in smaller groups drafting recommendations related to the ITFM.

The ACWDPU consists of representatives of water-resources-oriented groups, including national, State, and regional
organizations; Native Americans; professional and technical societies; public interest groups; private industry;
and the academic community. Its principal responsibility is to advise the Federal Government, through the U.S. Department
of the Interior, on activities and plans related to Federal water-information programs and the effectiveness of
those programs in meeting the Nation's water-information needs. The Director of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
chairs the ACWDPU.

 The MMS proposes to amend the regulations at 30 CFR 250.158 to include various safety-related regulations regarding
the design and operating procedures of production platforms and pipelines in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).
The proposed rule will reduce or prevent the unintentional release of hydrocarbons from pipelines on or near offshore
platforms during emergency situations to reduce the potential for explosions or fires.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data collected on PIF's are used to establish payor accounts for all mineral leases on Federal and Indian lands using
accounting identification numbers assigned by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). Changes in the paying responsibilities
on the lease are also reported on the PIF. The MMS is then able to maintain, reconcile, and audit lease accounts through
the use of its computerized Auditing and Financial System. This information will enable MMS to determine payors responsible
for paying rentals and royalties to MMS and the percentage of sales or production on which royalties are to be paid.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wheeling &amp; Lake Erie Railway Company (W&amp;LE) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR Part 1152 subpart
F_Exempt Abandonments to abandon its line of railroad, known as the Dalton Branch, extending from milepost 16.4 in
Massillon, Stark County, OH to the end of track at milepost 7.0 in Dalton, Wayne County, OH, a distance of 9.4 miles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
W&amp;LE has certified that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No overhead traffic has moved or could move over the line (the stub-ended Dalton Branch is not a through route and
thus cannot be utilized for overhead traffic); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on
behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any
U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic reports), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal
letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have
been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under
Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately
protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption
will be effective on May 19, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental
issues,

A stay will be issued routinely by the Commission in those proceedings where an informed decision on environmental
issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis in its independent investigation)
cannot be made prior to the effective date of the notice of exemption. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines,
5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any entity seeking a stay on environmental concerns is encouraged to file its request as soon
as possible in order to permit this Commission to review and act on the request before the effective date of this exemption.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) publishes notice at least once monthly of certain Federal
agency requests for records disposition authority (records schedules). Records schedules identify records of
sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States. Schedules also authorize
agencies after a specified period to dispose of records lacking administrative, legal, research, or other value.
Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized
for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal. NARA invites public
comments on such schedules, as required by 44 U.S.C. 3303a(a).

</SUMMARY>
<DATE>

DATES:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year U.S. Government agencies create billions of records on paper, film, magnetic tape, and other media. In order
to control this accumulation, agency records managers prepare records schedules specifying when the agency no longer
needs the records and what happens to the records after this period. Some schedules are comprehensive and cover all
the records of an agency or one of its major subdivisions. These comprehensive schedules provide for the eventual
transfer to the National Archives of historically valuable records and authorize the disposal of all other records.
Most schedules, however, cover records of only one office or program or a few series of records, and many are updates
of previously approved schedules. Such schedules also may include records that are designated for permanent retention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Destruction of records requires the approval of the Archivist of the United States. This approval is granted after
a thorough study of the records that takes into account their administrative use by the agency of origin, the rights
of the Government and of private persons directly affected by the Government's activities, and historical or other
value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This public notice identifies the Federal agencies and their subdivisions requesting disposition authority, includes
the control number assigned to each schedule, and briefly describes the records proposed for disposal. The records
schedule contains additional information about the records and their disposition. Further information about the
disposition process will be furnished to each requester.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings will
consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that those meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice hereby given that by Petition dated March 7, 1994, Thomas J. Saporito, Jr. (Petitioner), has requested that
the NRC taken action with regard to the Florida Power and Light Company. Specifically, the Petitioner requests that
the NRC: (1) Submit an amicus curiae brief to the Department of Labor (DOL) regarding his complaints number 89&hyph;ERA&hyph;007
and 89&hyph;ERA&hyph;017 concerning the Petitioner's claim that the licensee retaliated against him for engaging
in protected activity during his employment at Turkey Point Nuclear Station in violation of 10 CFR 50.7; (2) institute
a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to modify, suspend or revoke the licensee's licenses authorizing
the operation of Turkey Point; and (3) institute a show cause proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 and order the licensee
to provide the Petitioner with a ``make whole'' remedy, including but not limited to, immediate reinstatement to
his previous position, back wages and front pay with interest, compensatory damages for pain and suffering, and a
posting requirement to offset any ``chilling effect'' Petitioner's discharge may have had upon other employees
at the Turkey Point and St. Lucie Nuclear Stations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioner's stated bases for his requests can be summarized as follows: (1) Although the NRC generally defers
to the DOL process before taking action against a licensee, in this case the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rendered
a decision, enabling the NRC to take the action Petitioner requests, particularly to offset any ``chilling effect''
which may have resulted from the licensee's action; (2) under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DOL, there
are times NRC actions are warranted notwithstanding the ongoing DOL process because of the significance of the issues
to public health and safety; (3) the record in this case contains evidence which was ignored by the ALJ, and the NRC should
weigh the entire record in determining whether the licensee violated the Energy Reorganization Act (ERA) and 10 CFR
50.7; (4) the ALJ erred in several respects as a matter of law in reaching his decision that the Petitioner was not discriminated
against; (5) the adverse action by the licensee occurred immediately after the Petitioner was in contact with the
NRC and filed complaints under the ERA with DOL; (6) the licensee's actions against the Petitioner constitute a ``hostile
work environment'' and the NRC is mandated by Congress to ensure that a non-hostile work environment exists at NRC-licensed
facilities; (7) the NRC has a duty to ensure that licensee employers maintain a work environment which encourages
employees to raise safety issues, which is not the situation at Turkey Point because of the licensee's continuing
retaliation against employees who do so; (8) the licensee illegally interrogated Petitioner about his protected
activity; (9) if the NRC fails to act, it will contradict its own regulations that recognize the right of employees
to bypass management and report their concerns directly to the NRC; (10) the NRC has expressly defined ``protected
activities''; (11) the licensee's request that Petitioner be examined by a company doctor was unjustified; (12)
the licensee's disparate treatment of Petitioner was illegal and must be challenged by the NRC; and (13) the NRC is
required to act by virtue of its regulations at 10 CFR 50.9 which provide that the DOL process is an extension of NRC authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director, Office of Enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that by letter dated February 25, 1994 George M. Gillilan (Petitioner) has requested that the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC): (1) Immediately impose a $25,000 per day fine on the Tennessee Valley Authority
(TVA) until all reprisal, intimidation, harassment and discrimination actions involving the Petitioner are settled
to the Petitioner's satisfaction, and (2) appoint an independent arbitration board to review all past Department
of Labor suits and EEO complaints filed against TVA concerning the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant. Since this latter remedy
is beyond the scope of the Commission's authority, it has been denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As basis for this relief, the Petitioner asserts that due to his reporting of safety concerns to the Commission, TVA
management has subjected him to continuous intimidation, harassment, discrimination and reprisal actions, that
his name has been placed on a blackball list that has been circulated nationwide preventing him from obtaining suitable
employment outside of TVA and that this has affected his mental and physical health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The request is being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commission's regulations. The request has been referred
to the Director, Office of Enforcement. By letter dated April 7, 1994, the portion of the Petitioner's request that
asked for immediate action has been denied. As provided by &sect;2.206, appropriate action will be taken on this request
within a reasonable time. A copy of the Petition is available for inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room,
2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.

The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama (Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct Material
License No. 01&hyph;00643&hyph;02 (License), issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission)
pursuant to 10 CFR parts 30 and 35. The Licensee is authorized to possess and use byproduct material for diagnostic
and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures, and for research and development purposes. This is a broad scope license
and use of licensed material on humans is permitted by or under the supervision of a physician authorized by the Licensee's
Radiation Safety Committee, subject to the training and experience requirements in 10 CFR Part 35, Subpart J. The
License was most recently amended on April 10, 1992, and was due to expire on July 31, 1992. The License is currently
under timely renewal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 13, 1991, an allegation was received by the NRC relating to possible administrations of radiopharmaceuticals
in excess of prescribed dosages and possible falsification of records to conceal the misadministration. As a result,
an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations from October 9, 1991, through September 14, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of the investigation indicated that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance
with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was served
upon the Licensee by letter dated September 13, 1993. The Notice addressed the nature of the violations, the provisions
of the NRC's requirements that had been violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee responded to the Notice by two letters dated November 9, 1993. In its response, the Licensee admitted
Violations A and C.1, denied Violations B and C.2, and requested partial mitigation of the civil penalty based on its
prior performance.

On September 13, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for three
violations identified during an investigation conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (OI) from October 9,
1991 through September 14, 1992. Department of Veterans Affairs (Licensee) responded to the Notice in two letters
dated November 9, 1993. In its responses, the Licensee admitted Violations A and C.1, denied Violations B and C.2,
and requested partial mitigation of the civil penalty based on its prior performance and lack of evidence of actual
harm to any patient or member of the public. The NRC's evaluations and conclusion regarding the Licensee's requests
are as follows:

10 CFR 35.53 requires, in part, that a licensee measure the activity of each radiopharmaceutical dose that contains
more than 10 microcuries of a photon-emitting radionuclide before medical use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, the technologist failed to measure three radiopharmaceutical doses that contained more than
10 microcuries of a photon-emitting radionuclide administered to patients on July 22, 1991.

Summary of Licensee Response to Violation B
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensee denied this violation and indicated that the evidence does not support the technologist's alleged failure
to measure the radiopharmaceutical doses on July 22, 1991. In support of its denial, the Licensee stated that the count
rates of these doses when compared with the count rates of seven doses administered within sixty days of July 22, 1991,
reflect doses within acceptable limits. Therefore, argues the Licensee, it is not credible that this could be a chance
result in the absence of measuring by the technologist.

NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to Violation B
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensee presented data to indicate that the doses administered on July 22, 1991, had count rates similar to those
previously administered. This data, however, provides no information which would indicate that the does administered
to patients on July 22, 1991, were measured in a dose calibrator at the appropriate setting for Technetium&hyph;99m.
The information is not material to Violation B in that your analyses provides information relating to the activity
of material as measured during the scans themselves, but not whether activity was measured in the dose calibrator
prior to administration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the NRC letter transmitting the Notice, the NRC's conclusion that the technologist failed to measure
the dosages was based on: (1) The setting of a different isotope channel on both dose calibrators during the time the
technologist stated he measured three patient doses, (2) the missing radioactive material, (3) the high volume of
radioactive material recorded by the technologist on the patient dose log, and (4) the technologist's past history
of committing errors and omissions in patient dose records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If proper measurements had occurred, the technologist would have noticed the improper radionuclide channel (i.e.,
Thallium) and reset it when measuring the doses. The technologist would not have recorded the high volumes on the patient
dose log. The technologist admitted that the volumes in the records were fabricated, indicating that he had no knowledge
of the amount of doses administered providing further evidence that he has not measured the doses. The Licensee's
response did not address any of the evidence which indicated that the dosages had not been measured prior to administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the staff disagrees with the Licensee's argument that it is not credible to have the count rate of the seven
doses favorably compare with the doses administered on July 22, 1991, in the absence of measuring the dose in the dose
calibrator. An experienced technologist, knowing a prescribed radiopharmaceutical dose, may approximate with
some success the radiopharmaceutical dose by approximating the volume of the material. However, this method is not
reliable to assess the radiopharmaceutical dose and does not meet the requirement in 10 CFR 35.53(a) to measure each
radiopharmaceutical dosage in a dose calibrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preponderance of the evidence in this case indicates that the technologist failed to measure the doses. The NRC
concludes that the violation did occur as stated in the Notice.

Restatement of Violation C.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR 35.21 requires, in part, that the licensee, through the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO): (1) Ensure that radiation
safety activities are being performed in accordance with approved procedures and regulatory requirements in the
daily operation of the licensee's byproduct material program; and (2) that the RSO investigate misadministrations
and other deviations from approved radiation safety practice and implement corrective actions as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, the licensee failed to conduct a prompt and adequate investigation of possible misadministrations
of radiopharmaceuticals to patients during the week of July 22 through 26, 1991. Specifically, once notified of the
allegation, the RSO failed to obtain a copy and review a letter from the acting supervisor describing the possible
misadministrations or to interview individuals who had first-hand knowledge that was material to the investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Licensee's Response to Violation C.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensee denied that Violation C.2 constituted a breach of regulations. While it admitted that the regulations
require the RSO to investigate misadministrations, the Licensee stated that the regulations provide no standard
for the performance of the investigation and do not require that the investigation be performed in a ``prompt or adequate''
manner or to the satisfaction of the NRC. The Licensee stated that it conducted an investigation concerning this matter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee also stated that during the enforcement conference held on February 16, 1993, Mr. Ebneter, Regional
Administrator, Region II, pointed out that there was no regulation that tells the Licensee what has to be included
in an investigation. The Licensee also stated that Dr. Mallett, Deputy Director, Division of Radiation Safety and
Safeguards, Region II, indicated that he was comfortable with the Licensee's statement that it has looked at the rates
(as part of the investigation) and expressed satisfaction with the results of the Licensee's investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee denied that the investigation was not prompt or thorough, since the RSO was summoned back to duty from
vacation to look into the matter, the technologist at fault was counseled, and the NRC notified. The Licensee's investigation
concluded from statistical studies that there was no misadministration and that the errors were ones of record-keeping.
In addition, the Licensee stated that the NRC has not suggested what additional information or result could have been
obtained had the investigation been performed differently.

NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to Violation C.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for the Licensee to perform investigations that are prompt and adequate is implicit in 10 CFR 35.21. One purpose
of the requirement for an investigation of a possible misadministration is to determine whether there has, in fact,
been any misadministration. Further, the Commission's regulations require the licensee to implement as necessary
and, ensure corrective actions are taken. This protects individual patients and prevents future or potential misadministrations.
An investigation that is not prompt and not adequate cannot achieve these goals nor preclude potential or recurring
violation. Accordingly, the NRC rejects the Licensee's argument. In view of the above, the issue is whether the Licensee's
investigation was in fact prompt and adequate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC recognizes that the RSO was summoned back from vacation and initiated an investigation within a few days of
the request for his return, that the technologist at fault was counseled, and that the NRC was notified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC maintains that the Licensee's investigation was not adequate as defined in the NRC regulations.
Section 35.21 of 10 CFR part 35, requires, in part, that a Licensee investigate misadministrations and other deviations
from approved radiation safety practices and ``*&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
implement corrective actions as necessary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
'' (emphasis added). The NRC does expect, and the regulations do require, that such investigations be adequate to
meet the purpose of the investigations_the implementation of effective corrective actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation conducted by the Licensee was not adequate to determine the root cause of the problems and thus,
the Licensee's corrective actions were ineffective, as evidenced by the technologist's continual failures to record
the administered radiopharmaceutical activity and volume and the lack of supervisory oversight (see pages 75 and
76 of the transcribed enforcement conference). During the enforcement conference referenced in the Licensee's
response, the NRC pointed out that the Licensee did not perform an adequate investigation (P 75 and 76). The two specific
issues contained in the Notice, failure to review the letter that described the possible misadministration and failure
to interview individuals who had first-hand knowledge of this matter, are examples of inadequacies in the investigation
that led to the Licensee's inability to determine the root cause and take effective corrective actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Mr. Ebneter's statement that there was no regulation that tells the Licensee what has to be included
in investigations, it is true that the NRC regulations do not prescribe the exact methodology for conducting investigations.
As discussed above in this section and by Mr. Ebneter during the enforcement conference, however, the investigation
results are important and the regulations do prescribe that the investigation must be adequate to implement effective
corrective actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning Dr. Mallett's statement that he was comfortable with the Licensee's review of the count rates, the NRC
notes that Dr. Mallett's statement was not intended to suggest that the NRC considered the investigation adequate;
the statement was limited to what it said_that Dr. Mallett was comfortable with that one aspect of the investigation
(i.e., the Licensee's review of the count rates). The Licensee's assertion that this meant Dr. Mallett was satisfied
with the investigation as a whole appears to have been taken out of context. Within the context of the full meeting,
it is clear the NRC did not conclude that the investigation had been adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC concludes that the violation did occur as stated in the Notice.

Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensee stated that Violation B and Violation C.2 did not occur. The Licensee stated that there is no evidence
of harm to any patient or member of the public, even of a minor nature. The Licensee further stated that the evidence
does not demonstrate a misadministration of dosages on July 22, 1991 and that the technologist who administered the
doses denied administering excessive doses to patients on July 22, 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee further contended that the errors were essentially record-keeping errors of the Severity Level IV or
V type that might be aggregated to Severity Level III or IV but are not Severity Level II violations. In addition, the
Licensee stated that its performance has improved over the past year as demonstrated by the last two NRC inspections.
Thus, the Licensee argues, in accordance with the Enforcement Policy, the NRC should not have escalated the penalty
50 percent for poor past performance because its performance is improving.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request Mitigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The arguments made by the Licensee concerning the acceptability of the doses and the lack of evidence of harm to patients
or members of the general public do not relate to the requirement to measure dosages prior to administration or to the
requirements to perform adequate investigation of possible misadministrations. Further, the Licensee's contention
that the evidence does not demonstrate misadministration of doses, or excessive or inadequate doses, is not pertinent
to the violation cited. The Licensee was not cited for administering excessive or inadequate doses, or misadministrations.
These arguments only provide information that the Licensee believes that excessive dosages were not administered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the Licensee's request to reduce the severity level from a Severity Level II to a Severity Level III or
Severity Level IV, the NRC notes that Section IV of the Enforcement Policy (i.e., 10 CFR part 2, Appendix C) states,
in part, that ``Supplements I through VIII provide examples and serve as guidance in determining the severity level
for violations in each of the eight activity areas. However, the examples are neither exhaustive nor controlling
*&blank;*&blank;*. The NRC reviews each case being considered for enforcement action on its own merits to ensure
that the severity of the violation is characterized at the level best suited to the significance of the particular
violation. In some cases special circumstances may warrant an adjustment to the severity level characterization.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In this case, the NRC had a very significant regulatory concern as noted in the cover letter to the Notice. There were
numerous instances where patient dosages were not measured, numerous instances where patient dosages were not accurately
recorded prior to administration, and for an extended period of time, effective corrective actions were not taken.
The severity of the violations was exacerbated by the technologist's continual failures to accurately record patient
dosages despite repeated counseling, and by the failure on the part of the Chairman of the Radiation Safety Committee
to take strong and effective corrective actions in the face of the known repeated violations on the part of the technologist.
Given these circumstances and the very significant regulatory concern surrounding this case, a Severity Level II
Problem categorization was warranted, in accordance with Section IV of the Enforcement Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With reference to the Licensee's performance, the NRC recognizes that inspections of the Licensee during the period
of late 1992 and 1993 have not shown the same level of poor performance as identified in 1991 and early 1992. The Enforcement
Policy statement regarding improved performance relates to performance during the period of either the last two
years prior to the inspection at issue or the period of the last two inspections prior to the inspection at issue, whichever
is longer. Thus, any improvement in performance subsequent to the inspection at issue may not be considered as part
of any mitigation for the licensee performance factor.

NRC Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its evaluation of the Licensee's responses, the NRC concludes that Violations B and C.2 did occur as stated,
that all violations delineated in the Notice were properly categorized in aggregate as a Severity Level II problem,
and that an adequate basis for mitigation of the proposed civil penalty has not been provided by the Licensee. Accordingly,
a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $10,000 should be imposed by order.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposed to amend Rule 127, Commentary .01 to provide that the minimum fractional change applicable
to trading of Standard &amp; Poor's (``S&amp;P'') Depositary Receipts (``SPDRs'') shall be 1/64 of $1.00.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, Amex, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission notes that, although SPDRs currently are listed and traded on the Amex, it is conceivable that other
national securities exchanges or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. could apply for authority
to list and trade SPDRs. At the present time, however, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') is not capable of accommodating
quotes in 1/64's. Telephone conversation between Thomas Demchek, SIAC, and Beth Stekler, Attorney, Division of
Market Regulation, SEC, on April 12, 1994. Accordingly, if other securities exchanges and/or national securities
associations file for permission to list and trade SPDRs, the Commission would at that time be required to re-evaluate
the adequacy and sufficiency of ITS in conjunction with section 11A's statutory mandate to assure fair competition
between the exchanges.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purposes of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amex Rule 127 provides parameters for the minimum fractional change for dealings in securities on the Exchange. Commentary
.01 to Rule 127 provides that for securities listed under Amex Rule 1000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Portfolio Depositary Receipts (``PDRs''), the minimum fractional change shall be 1/32 of $1.00. One issuance of
PDRs, SPDRs, is currently trading on the Exchange. The Exchange now proposes to reduce the minimum fractional change
applicable to SPDRs to 1/64.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In approving trading of PDRs in 1/32's, the Commission stated that such trading would enhance market liquidity and
should promote more accurate pricing, tighter quotations and reduced price fluctuations. The Commission also noted
that such trading should allow customers to receive the best possible execution of their transactions in these securities.

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31794 (January 29, 1993), 58 FR 7272 (February 5, 1993) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex-92&hyph;45).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes the benefits identified by the Commission in connection with trading PDRs in 1/32's will be
further enhanced by trading SPDRs in 1/64's. Such trading should further reduce price fluctuations based on the underlying
index for the particular issuance (i.e., S&amp;P 500 Index). Such trading parameters should benefit retail customers,
institutions, and other market participants that invest in or trade SPDRs. In addition, a narrower quotation spread
should make such securities more useful professionals who may hedge their positions in futures or other derivative
markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange will issue an Information Circular to members and member organizations relating to trading SPDRs in
1/64's prior to commencement of such trading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of Section
6(b)(5) in particular in that it is intended to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to facilitate transactions
in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee, or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore
has become effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder.
At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule
change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Liability of Governors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delaware's General Corporation Law permits the adoption of a provision in the Certificate of Incorporation of a Delaware
corporation that limits or eliminates the potential monetary liability of directors to the corporation or its shareholders
by reason of their conduct as directors under certain circumstances. Such a provision does not apply to acts or omissions
of directors occurring prior to the approval of the provision by shareholders and the filing of the amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the CHX is a Delaware Corporation, the amendment to Article Eleventh of its Certificate of Incorporation
is based on section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporations Code.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Section 102(b)(7) permits corporations to include in their certificates of incorporation a provision limiting
or eliminating the personal liability of directors to the corporation and its shareholders for monetary damages
for a breach of their fiduciary duty. The statute does not permit the limitation or elimination of director's liability

 In addition, the statute does not permit the adoption of any provision that would eliminate or limit the liability

The Delaware statute does not eliminate a director's fiduciary duty, but rather prevents the imposition of monetary
damages in the event of a breach of that duty. Other legal remedies for breach of fiduciary duty, such as rescission
and injunction, remain available under the Delaware provision.

The amendment to the CHX's Certificate of Incorporation limits the liability of Governors to the fullest extent of
Delaware Law. The amendment includes the exclusions from limited liability enumerated in Delaware section 207(b)(7)
and adds an exclusion where liability arises directly or indirectly as a result of a violation of a federal securities
laws. The amendment also eliminates Governor monetary liability for acts occurring after the amendment becomes
effective to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by Delaware law, thus automatically incorporating any
future statutory revisions limiting Governor liability.

A similar amendment to the Constitution was approved by the Board, the membership and the Securities and Exchange
Commission in late 1989 and early 1990. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27625 (January 16, 1989), 55 FR 2470 (January
24, 1990). However, the requisite number of membership votes was not obtained to amend the Certificate of Incorporation
under the then existing voting requirement. The CHX put the 1989 proposal to a vote of its members in 1990. At that time,
the Exchange's rules requiring only a majority of the members present at a meeting to approve a change to the Constitution,
while requiring a majority of the entire membership to approve changes to the Certificate of Incorporation. The Exchange
was able to pass the amendment to the Constitution, but did not have sufficient votes to amend its Certificate of Incorporation.
The discrepancy in the number of votes needed to amend the Constitution and the Certificate of Incorporation was removed
in the Exchange's corporate restructuring which the Commission approved in 1992. Securities Exchange Act Release
No. 31633 (December 22, 1992), 57 FR 62402 (December 30, 1992). The standard for amending both the CHX's Constitution
and Certificate of Incorporation is now a majority of the members present at a meeting.

Article VI, Section 4 of the CHX's Constitution provides that the President is ``a member of the Board of Governors
and an ex-officio member, without the right to vote, of all committees except the Nominating, Audit, and Compensation
Committees.'' The rule change grants the president voting power on the Exchange's Committees of which he is an ex-officio
member if so designated in the CHX's Constitution or Rules. The rule change to Article V, Section 4 of the CHS's Constitution
grants the President full voting powers on the Executive Committee. In addition, the rule change adds Judiciary Committees
and the Committee on Organization and Governance to the list of committees of which the president is not an ex-officio
member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article VI, Section 2 of the CHX's Constitution provides that the Chairman of the Board of Governors is ``an ex-officio

Nominating Committee.'' The rule change allows to Exchange to designate the Chairman's right to vote on committees
in the Exchange's Rules as well as the Constitution. The rule change to Article IV, Rules 7 and 9 of the Exchange's Rules
grants the Chairman of the Board full voting powers on the Committee on Organization and Governance and the Compensation
Committee. In addition, the rule change to Article VI, Section 2 of the Constitution specifies that the Chairman is
not a member of any Judiciary Committee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and with the requirements of Section 6(b) of
the Act.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with sections 6(b)(1), (3), and (5) of the
Act.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Section 6(b)(1) requires that an exchange be organized and have the capacity to carry out the purposes of the Act and
to comply, and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the Act, the rules
and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the exchange. Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires, among other things,
that the rule of an exchange assures a fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration
of its affairs. Section 6(b)(5) requires, among other things, that the rules of an exchange be designed, in general,
to protect investors and the public interest.

The Powers and responsibilities of the CHX's Board of Governors are set out in the Exchange's Constitution. Under
Article III, Section 1, the Board of Governors is authorized to manage the business of the Exchange and is vested with
all powers necessary for the government of the Exchange, including the regulation of the business conduct of members
and member organizations and the promotion of the welfare, objects and purposes of the Exchange. Furthermore, Section
1 provides that the Board may establish Rules governing the qualifications for membership and the requirements for
remaining a member in good standing. The Board is also given the power to fill vacancies in any office, including the
Board of Governors, but excluding the Nominating Committee, until the next annual meeting. The Board also has the
power to interpret the Constitution and Rules of the Exchange, and any interpretation made by it remains final and
conclusive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Board of Governors of a national securities exchange has a crucial role in ensuring that the exchange meets its
responsibilities as a self-regulatory organization under the Act. In view of this, the CHX proposal is limited so
that the exemption from monetary damages is not available where liability is based, directly or indirectly, on a violation
of the federal securities laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the Commission recognizes that national securities exchanges, such as the CHX, are incorporated
under state law and, as such, are generally entitled to take advantage of provisions under state corporation codes
to the extent they are consistent with the federal securities laws. The proposed rule change adequately balances
the need to retain the special responsibilities of directors of national securities exchanges with the desire of
the Exchange to adopt state law provisions pertaining to its corporate structure. The rule change allows the Exchange
to take advantage of section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware Corporations Code as would any other organization incorporated
in Delaware, except where the imposition of monetary actions involves a violation of the federal securities laws.
Accordingly, Governors of the CHX will still be subject to the full panoply of damages in actions involving violations
of the federal securities laws.

To the extent there is any concern that the imposition of monetary damages against Board members for violations of
federal securities laws would deter persons from acting on CHX's Board of Governors, the Commission notes that Article
X of the CHX's Constitution and Article Eleventh of the CHX's Certificate of Incorporation allows the Exchange to
provide indemnification to members of its Board of Governors, within the limits permitted by Delaware law, to safeguard
them from expense and liability for actions that they take in such capacity in good faith in furtherance of, or without
belief that such actions are opposed to, the best interests of the CHX and is members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission believes that the CHX's proposal to split its annual meeting and provide for an annual election meeting
and an annual report meeting will allow Exchange members to better concentrate on the respective issues. The annual
election meeting will be held to vote for Governors and the Nomination Committee. The annual report meeting will be
held to provide management, the Board, and members an opportunity to discuss the previous year's results and current
issues facing the Exchange. Because each of these meetings is of extreme importance and may involve lengthy discussions,
the Commission believes holding two separate meetings is appropriate and consistent with section 6(b)(3) of the
Act which requires that the rules of the exchange assures a fair representation of its members in the selection of its
directors and administration of its affairs.

The Commission notes that the proposal could allow the annual election meeting to take place prior to the annual report
meeting. Before setting the meeting times, the Exchange should consider that the report meeting may provide information
to members that is relevant to their election of Governors at the annual election meeting.

 In December 1992, the Commission approved changes to the CHX's organization and governance,

 When appointing the Executive Committee members the CHX's Constitution directs the Vice Chairman to assure the geographic

Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the
selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors represent issuers
and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or a broker-dealer. The Executive Committee wields
most of the powers of the full Board between Board meetings. As a result, floor domination of the Executive Committee

The rule change now under consideration provides that the Executive Committee will be comprised of
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 at least
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 seven floor governors. This change allows the Vice Chairman, with Board approval, to expand the number of governors
serving on the Executive Committee. While the Commission believes that the Exchange should be able to expand the number
of Governors serving on the Committee if such expansion is necessary for the efficient administration of Exchange
business, the Commission expects the Exchange to maintain the relative representation of the various geographic
groups on the Committee and would be concerned if the Committee was dominated by a particular group (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 floor members). The CHX has represented that it will continue to support diversity in the Executive Committee. Specifically,
the CHX has indicated that the Vice Chairman will appoint additional governors, should the number be increased from
seven, in a manner which will continue fair representation of public Governors, ``upstairs'' member Governors,
and floor member Governors as required by the CHX's Constitution.

 Section 6(b)(3) of the Act requires that the rules of an exchange assure a fair representation of its members in the

Preliminarily, the Commission believes the rule change to Article VI, Sections 2 (Chairman) and 4 (President) to
provide that the Chairman and President are ex-officio members of all Executive Committees (except those specified
in the provisions) without the right to vote unless ``otherwise designated in the Constitution or the Rules'' is consistent
with the Act. The rule change allows the Exchange to indicate if the Chairman or President has the right to vote on a particular
Committee in the Section or Rule pertaining to each Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that giving the President full voting powers on the Executive Committee is consistent with
the President's voting powers on the Board. The Commission notes that the Executive Committee has full Board authority
to act between Board meetings on most issues. In addition, because the Exchange's Constitution requires that the
president not be a member of the Exchange or affiliated in any way with a member organization during his incumbency,
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 granting the President voting powers does not change the presentation on the Executive Committee of any particular
group. Therefore, this rule change is consistent with sections 6(b) (1) and (3) of the Act.

The Commission also believes that the Exchange's proposal to allow the Vice Chairman, with Board Approval, to expand
the number of Governors serving on the Finance Committee is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(1) of
the Act because the rule change is designed to enhance the governance process of the Exchange. The Finance Committee
reviews annual profit plans and budgets for the Exchange and its subsidiaries, reviews the financial condition of
the Exchange and its subsidiaries, reviews the performance of Exchange investments, formulates investment policy,
and makes recommendations to the management or Board. Because this Committee has an important function involving
a wide range of financial issues, the Commission believes it is reasonable that the Exchange may decide that additional
Governors are necessary for the Committee to fulfill its duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Commission believes that the rule change to give the Chairman full voting rights as a member of the
Compensation Committee and the Committee on Organization and Governance is consistent with Sections 6(b) (1) and
(3) of the Act. The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the compensation of the President and
for coordinating with the President to determine a comprehensive corporate compensation and benefits policy.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The Committee on Organization and Governance is responsible for periodically reviewing the organization and governance
structure of the Exchange and its subsidiaries, and for making recommendations to the Board of Governors with respect
thereto.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 The Chairman is appointed by the Board of Governors from among the 24 Governors, and may accordingly be an ``up-stairs''
member, a floor member, or a public governor. Granting the Chairman voting rights on the Compensation Committee and
the Committee on Organization and Governance, therefore, may change the relative representation of one of these
constituencies. The Commission expects that the Exchange will ensure fair representation on these Committees consistent
with section 6(b)(3) of the Act.

The Commission believes that the rule change providing that neither the Chairman nor the President are ex-officio
members of any Judiciary Committee also is consistent with Sections 6(b)(1) and (5) of the Act. Article IV, Rule 5 of
the Exchange's Rules states that ``the President shall appoint five disinterested members of the Exchange and/or
general partners or officers of member organizations as a Judiciary Committee'' whenever a disciplinary matter
is to be reviewed in accordance with the Rules. The rule change specifies that the Chairman and President are not ex-officio
members of any Judiciary Committee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission believes that the rule change replacing ``Public Governor'' with ``non-member Governor''
and defining the term as a ``Governor who is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer in securities, as
defined in Article III, Section 2 of the Exchange's Constitution,'' serves to provide consistency within the CHX's
Constitution and Rules, and has no substantive effect. The Commission notes, however, that ``non-member Governors''
are intended to be representatives of the public and that the term is synonymous with the Commission's use of the term
``public Governor'' in general, and in this order and the order approving the 1992 changes to the CHX's organization
and governance.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 This interpretation is consistent with Section 6(b)(3) of the Act, which requires that the Exchange provide that
one or more directors be representatives of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange,
broker, or dealer.

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication
of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 made a non-substantive change to the proposal by including in the rules
the Constitutional definition that a non-member Governor is unaffiliated with the Exchange or any broker or dealer
in securities.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 7, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
constituting a fee under &sect;19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective upon the Commission's
receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from
interested persons.

In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed

and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD's Advertising Regulation Department began offering an expedited review process in February, 1991 for those
members who desired review and comment of advertising and sales literature that was faster than the normal review
and comment process, which is ten business days. The expedited process is completed within three business days. Over
the past three years, use of the expedited process has increased far beyond the NASD's expectation. The expedited
filing process has become standard operating procedure for many of the program's most frequent users and many items
filed are frequently more difficult to review because they contain new concepts and approaches requiring greater
time for research and analysis. The increase in the number of expedited filings has led to a significant increase in
the amount of administrative processing and has made it more difficult to provide service within the ten-day turnaround
time for normal filings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD is proposing an amendment to Section 13 of Schedule A to the NASD By-Laws which establishes a fee structure
that will give members the ability to choose the level of service that best fits their needs, taking into consideration
the costs related to that level. Each of the specific fees would be increased, including the service charge for expedited
service. However, the service charge for expedited service would no longer be imposed in addition to the base service
charge and the number of pages or minutes of video that triggers an additional fee would be increased, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
from 5 to 10 pages and from 5 to 10 minutes. The text of the amendment identifies each of the changes to the fees. The NASD
is requesting that the amendment be implemented on May 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of dues, fees and other charges
among members in that the proposed rule equitably adjusts the fees assessed for the review of advertising and sales
literature to accurately reflect the time spent and level of analysis performed per item submitted for review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and subparagraph
(e) of rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder in that it constitutes a due, fee or other charge. The rule will be implemented on
May 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may
summarily abrogate the rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in
the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on April 8, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'')
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described
in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared by the NASD. The NASD has designated this proposal as one
constituting an administrative matter under Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act, which renders the rule effective
upon the Commission's receipt of this filing. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the
proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, the NASD is obligated to ensure fair representation, of its members.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Article VII, section 4(b) to the NASD By-Laws authorizes the Board to consider the fairness of the representation
of members by the current administrative district structure
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and, whenever the Board finds unfairness in such representation, to change the number and boundaries of the administrative
districts. Changes are necessary to the existing administrative district structure from time to time to address
significant demographic shifts in the NASD's membership and to ensure fair and effective district representation
on the Board. The Board noted that whereas the representation of District 7 currently includes United States territorial
possessions in the Caribbean, the Canal Zone and the Virgin Islands, no comparable representation exists for U.S.
Pacific territories and possessions. The proposed rule change thus remedies this lack of representation by amending
Schedule B to the By-Laws to assign all U.S. Pacific territories and possessions to NASD District 2.

Section 15A(b)(4) of the Act requires that ``[T]he rules of the association [NASD] assure a fair representation of
its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and provide that one or more directors
shall be representative of issuers and investors and not be associated with a member of the association, broker, or

For purposes of administration, the NASD has divided the United States, its territories and possessions into ``districts''
the boundaries of which are established by the Board of Governors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of Section 15A(b)(4) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the fair representation of its members in the selection
of its directors and administration of its affairs in that the proposed rule change ensures the fair representation
of members in the district structure.

The foregoing rule change has become effective upon filing pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act and subparagraph

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At any time within 60 days of the filing of a rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act, the Commission may

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Oil Terminal and Oil Tanker Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990 (33 U.S.C. 2732) (the Act),
the Coast Guard may certify, on an annual basis, an alternative voluntary advisory group (advisory group) in lieu
of Regional Citizens' Advisory councils for Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound Alaska. The Coast Guard published
guidelines on December 31, 1992, to assist groups seeking recertification under the Act (57 FR 62600). The Coast Guard
issued a policy statement on July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36505), to clarify the factors that the Coast Guard would be considering
in making its determination as to whether advisory groups should be certified in accordance with the Act; and the procedures
which the Coast Guard would follow in meeting its certification responsibilities under the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has received an application for recertification of CIRCAC, the currently certified advisory group
for the Cook Inlet region. In accordance with the review and certification process contained in the policy statement,
the Coast Guard now solicits comments from interested groups including oil terminal facility owners and operators,
owners and operators of crude oil tankers calling at the terminal facilities, and fishing, aquacultural, recreational
and environmental citizens groups, concerning the recertification application of CIRCAC. At the conclusion of
the comment period, the Coast Guard will review all application materials and comments received and will take one
of the following actions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Recertify the advisory group under 33 U.S.C. 2732(o).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Issue a conditional recertification for a period of 90 days, with a statement of any discrepancies which must be
corrected to qualify for recertification for the remainder of the year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Deny recertification of the advisory group if the Coast Guard finds that the group is not broadly representative
of the interests and communities in the area or is not adequately fostering the goals and purposes of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard will notify CIRCAC by letter of the action taken on its application. A notice will be published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Starting with Fiscal Year 1993 funds, participating jurisdictions must provide a 25 percent matching contribution
for HOME funds drawn from the participating jurisdiction's Treasury accounts for rental assistance, housing rehabilitation
and acquisition of standard housing, and a 30 percent matching contribution for HOME funds drawn for new construction,
unless the participating jurisdiction has received a reduction in the match requirement. This notice provides information
on the level of fiscal distress for each State and indicates those States that receive a reduction in the match requirement
for Fiscal Year 1994 because they are in fiscal distress or severe fiscal distress.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Match Reduction for States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A HOME interim rule is published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 92.222(a) of this interim rule sets out the criteria for determining fiscal distress and severe fiscal distress
for participating jurisdictions that are States. This notice is published to announce the States that receive a match
reduction for Fiscal Year 1994 under these distress criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice lists all States (as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia which are, by statute, defined as States
for the HOME Program), the average per capita income (PCI) for each, how the State's PCI relates to the national average
PCI (which was $14,277 for 1989, the latest data available), the percent of each State's families in poverty and how
that relates to the national average (which was 10.58 percent in 1990), the average personal income growth rate in
the State over the most recent four quarters, and how that relates to the national personal income growth rate during
that period (which was 5.4 percent from the end of the third quarter of 1992 to the end of the third quarter of 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, to qualify under the PCI criterion, the PCI for the State must be less than $10,708. To qualify under the poverty
criterion, the State's percent of families in poverty must be 13.23 percent or higher, and to qualify under the personal
income growth rate, the State's rate must be 4.0 percent or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the interim rule indicates, States that satisfy one of the criteria are considered in fiscal distress and receive
a 50 percent match reduction for the term specified at 24 CFR 92.222(a)(4). States that satisfy at least two of the three
distress criteria are considered in severe fiscal distress and receive a 100 percent match reduction for the period
specified at 24 CFR 92.222(a)(3). The list of States follows as appendix A to this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Purpose and Substantive Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sec. 14, United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 14371); sec. 7(d) Department of Housing and Urban Development
Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). An interim rule revising the CIAP regulation, 24 CFR part 968, subparts A and B, for PHAs and
24 CFR part 905, subpart I, for IHAs, and streamlining the program was published on March 15, 1993. A final rule will
be published shortly.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Major Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1993, the CIAP was streamlined to make it easier for smaller HAs to participate in the program and to give smaller
HAs the same flexibility as CGP agencies. The CIAP Application was simplified, the processing groups were reduced
to two (Group 1 and Group 2), and the modernization types were reduced to two (Emergency and Other). Under the modernization
type of ``Other'', the HA may apply for, and HUD may fund, a variety of needs, ranging from a single physical or management
work item to complete rehabilitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Program Highlights
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Departmental Priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Improving Public and Indian Housing is one of the Department's major priorities. Accordingly, a review is being made
of the entire Public and Indian Housing Program. Specifically, the Department is very concerned about several aspects
of the Modernization Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Design.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When identifying physical improvement needs to meet the modernization standards, HAs are encouraged to consider
design which supports the integration of public housing into the broader community. Although high priority needs,
such as those related to health and safety, vacant/substandard units, structural or system integrity, and compliance
with statutory, regulatory or court-ordered deadlines, will receive funding priority, HAs should plan their modernization
in a way which promotes good design, but maintains the modest nature of public housing. The HA should pay particular
attention to design and be receptive to creative, but cost-effective approaches suggested by architects, residents,
HA staff, and other local entities. Such approaches can complement the planning for basic rehabilitation needs.
It should be noted that there will be no increase in operating subsidy due to items added (for example, additional landscaping)
to promote the blend of public housing into the surrounding neighborhood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Expediting the program.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HAs are reminded that they are expected to obligate all funds within two years and to expend all funds within three years
of program approval (Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) Amendment execution) unless a longer project implementation
schedule is approved by the Field Office. If the HA does not obligate approved funds in a timely manner, the Department
will recapture the funds unless there are clear, valid reasons for not meeting the obligation deadline; i.e., delays
which are outside of the HA's control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident involvement and economic uplift. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAs are encouraged to explore and implement through all feasible means the involvement of residents in all aspects
of the CIAP, from planning through implementation. In addition, HAs are encouraged to seek ways to employ residents
in all aspects of the CIAP's operation and/or to develop means to promote contracting opportunities for resident-owned
businesses. PHAs should use Section 3 provisions to the maximum feasible extent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Elimination of vacant units. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Department has a vacancy reduction effort specifically aimed at reducing vacancies, HAs are encouraged
to apply for CIAP funds to address eligible vacancy problems (i.e., those which do not involve routine maintenance)
to the extent such problems have not been funded through other sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Relationship to Technical Review Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Departmental goal of improving Public and Indian Housing is reflected in the technical review factors, set forth
in section IV(c)(5), on which the Field Office scores each HA's CIAP Application. Based on the HA's total score, the
Field Office then ranks each HA to determine selection for Joint Review. The technical review factors include the
following Departmental initiatives to improve Public and Indian Housing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Restoration of vacant units to occupancy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Resident capacity-building, including opportunities for resident management; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Economic development, job training and employment opportunities for residents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Drug elimination initiatives; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Partnership with local government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Total Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FY 1994 HUD Appropriations Act Public Law 103&hyph;124, enacted October 28, 1993, made available $3,230,000,000
of budget authority for the Modernization Program in the Annual Contributions Account. An emergency Supplemental
Appropriations Act Public Law 103&hyph;211 made available an additional $25,000,000 for modernization of existing
public housing projects damaged in the January 1994 earthquake in Southern California. In addition, there is a reduction
of $1,170, which is the Modernization Program's share of the Department's estimated 1993 carry-over of the Annual
Contributions Account. The following chart shows the total amount of funds available in FY 1994, which are the appropriations,
plus the carry-overs from FY 1993, minus the reduction and set-asides:

If the demand for LBP Risk Assessment funds is greater than the set-aside of $11,956,923, the Department may use a portion
of the $75,000,000 reserve for this purpose where emergencies are involved. Emergencies would be limited to units
housing children under seven years old with elevated blood lead levels (EBLs) and HA-owned day care facilities used
by children under seven years old with EBLs. Use of reserve funds for LBP Risk Assessment emergencies at CIAP agencies
would require a waiver of 24 CFR 968.103(b) or 24 CFR 905.601(b).

(1) The $2,995,892,539 balance is allocated between CIAP and CGP agencies based on the relative shares of backlog
needs (weighted at 50%) and accrual needs (weighted at 50%), as determined by the field inspections conducted for
the HUD-funded ABT study of modernization needs. This allocation results in CIAP agencies receiving 10.58% or $316,863,505
(plus the $16,299 carryover for a total of $316,879,804) and CGP agencies receiving 89.42% or $2,679,029,034 (plus
the $6,063,827 carryover for a total of $2,685,092,861) of the funds available.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Headquarters has determined the distribution of Public Housing CIAP funds for each HUD Region based on the relative
shares of backlog and accrual needs for CIAP agencies. In assigning funds to each Region, Headquarters will designate
an amount to be subassigned to each non-Indian Field Office, based on each Office's FY 1993 subassignment and adjusted
as necessary. The FY 1993 subassignments reflected both relative shares of modernization needs within the Region
and PHA capability to administer the modernization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Field Office Public Housing Division Director shall have authority to make Joint Review selections and CIAP
funding decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If additional funds for Public Housing CIAP become available, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
Headquarters will allocate the funds to one or more Field Offices based on their relative shares of modernization
need, approvable applications, and PHA capability to carry out the modernization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a Field Office does not receive sufficient fundable applications to use its allocation, Headquarters will
reallocate the remaining funds to one or more Field Offices based on approvable applications and PHA capability to
carry out the modernization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the $291,925,067 available for Public Housing, 1% or $2,919,251 has been set aside to carry out goals related to
pending civil rights litigation (e.g., Young v. Cisneros), which is subject to judicial oversight. The following
table shows the distribution of CIAP funds for PHAs, excluding IHAs, assigned by Headquarters to each Region for subassignment
to the Field Offices as percentages of the $289,005,816 balance available for Public Housing:

In preparing its CIAP Application, the HA is encouraged to assess all its physical and management improvement needs.
Physical improvement needs should be reviewed against the modernization standards, as set forth in HUD Handbook
7485.2, as revised, and any cost-effective energy conservation measures, identified in updated energy audits.
The modernization standards include development specific work to ensure the long-term viability of the developments,
such as amenities and design changes to promote the integration of low-income housing into the broader community.
See section I(c)(1)(i). In addition, the HA is strongly encouraged to contact the Field Office to discuss its modernization
needs and obtain information. The term ``Field Office'' includes the ONAP.

IV. Application Processing by Field Office
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Completeness Review (Corrections to Deficient Applications)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible for processing, the CIAP Application must be received by the Field Office within the time period specified
in this NOFA and must be complete. In order to determine whether an application is complete, responsive to the NOFA
and acceptable for technical processing, the Field Office shall perform a completeness review, using the following
criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The application was received by HUD at the appropriate address by the date and time specified in the NOFA and was
complete and responsive (excluding exhibits which are certifications); or

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If an application is determined to be incomplete or to have missing certifications, the HA shall be advised in writing
of any deficiencies or any inconsistencies. The missing information is to be submitted within a specified period
of time from the date of HUD's written notification. This is not additional time to substantially revise the application.
Deficiencies which may be corrected at this time are inadvertently omitted documents or clarifications of previously
submitted material and other changes which are not of such a nature as to improve the competitive position of the application.
The HA must acceptably correct deficiencies (including furnishing missing certifications) within 21 calendar
days of notification from the Field Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If Form HUD&hyph;52822, CIAP Application, is missing, the HA's application will be considered substantially
incomplete and, therefore, ineligible for further processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If Form HUD&hyph;50071, Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans, and Cooperative Agreements, SF&hyph;LLL,
Disclosure of Lobbying Activities, or Form HUD&hyph;2880, Applicant/Recipient Update/Disclosure Form, is required,
but missing or there is a technical mistake, such as no signature on a submitted form, the HA will be given an opportunity
to correct the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Eligibility Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HAs with fewer than 250 units are eligible to participate in the CIAP. After the HA's CIAP Application is determined
to be complete and accepted for review, the Field Office eligibility review shall determine if the application meets
the basic eligibility requirements and, therefore, is eligible for processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Eligibility for Processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be eligible for processing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Development eligibility
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The development is either a public housing development, including a conveyed Lanham Act or Public Works Administration
development, or a Section 23 Leased Housing Bond-Financed project (BFP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Date of full availability (DOFA)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each eligible development for which work is proposed has reached DOFA at the time of CIAP Application submission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Eligibility for Processing on Reduced Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where certain conditions exist, the HA will be eligible for processing on a reduced scope as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Funds owed the department
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Where the HA owes funds to the Department as a result of excess development, modernization or operating funds previously

Selection Criteria and Ranking Factors
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After all CIAP Applications are reviewed for eligibility, the Field Office shall categorize the eligible HAs and
their developments into two processing groups, as defined in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph: Group 1 for Emergency
Modernization; and Group 2 for Other Modernization. HA developments may be included in both groups and the same development
may be in each group. However, the HA is only required to submit one CIAP Application, which the Field Office will process
under either Group 1 or Group 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Grouping Modernization Types
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Group 1, emergency modernization
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Developments having physical conditions of an emergency nature, posing an immediate threat to the health or safety
of residents or related to fire safety, and which must be corrected within one year of CIAP funding approval. Funding
is limited to physical work items and may not be used for management improvements. Emergency Modernization includes
all LBP testing and abatement of units housing children under seven years old with elevated blood lead levels (EBLs)
and all LBP testing and abatement of HA-owned day care facilities used by children under seven years old with EBLs.
Group 1 developments are not subject to the technical review rating and ranking in subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this
paragraph or the long-term viability and reasonable cost determination in section V(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Group 2, other modernization
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Developments not having physical conditions of an emergency nature and located in HAs which have demonstrated a
capability of carrying out the proposed modernization activities. Other Modernization includes: one or more physical
work items, where the Field Office determines that the physical improvements are necessary and sufficient to extend
the useful life of the development; and/or one or more development specific or HA-wide management work items (including
planning costs); and/or testing, professional risk assessments, interim containment, and abatement of LBP. Therefore,
eligibility of work under Other Modernization ranges from a single work item to the complete rehabilitation of a development.
Refer to section I(c)(1)(i) regarding modest amenities and improved design. Group 2 developments are subject to
the technical review rating and ranking in subparagraphs (5) and (6) of this paragraph and the long-term viability
and reasonable cost determination in section V(e).

(2) Assessment of HA's Management Capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its technical review of the CIAP Application, the Field Office shall evaluate the HA's management capability.
Particular attention shall be given to the adequacy of the HA's maintenance in determining the HA's management capability.
This assessment shall be based on the compliance aspects of on-site monitoring, such as audits, reviews or surveys
which are currently available within the Field Office, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on the performance review under the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) for PHAs or the Administrative
Capability Assessment for IHAs, and other information sources, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A PHA has management capability if it is (A) not designated as Troubled under Part 901, PHMAP, or (B) designated as
Troubled, but has a reasonable prospect of acquiring management capability which may include through CIAP-funded
management improvements. A Troubled PHA may be considered for funding of non-emergency physical improvements where
it is making reasonable progress toward meeting the performance targets established in its memorandum of agreement
under &sect;901.140.

(3) Assessment of HA's Modernization Capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its technical review of the CIAP Application, the Field Office shall evaluate the HA's modernization capability,
including the progress of previously approved modernization and the status of any outstanding findings from CIAP
monitoring visits, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A PHA has modernization capability if it is (A) not designated as Modernization Troubled under Part 901, PHMAP, or
(B) designated as Modernization Troubled, but has a reasonable prospect of acquiring modernization capability
which may include through CIAP-funded management improvements and administrative support, such as hiring staff
or contracting for assistance. A Modernization Troubled PHA may be considered for funding of non-emergency physical
improvements where it is making reasonable progress toward meeting the performance targets established in its memorandum
of agreement under &sect;901.140. Where a PHA does not have a funded modernization program in progress, the Field
Office shall determine whether the PHA has a reasonable prospect of acquiring modernization capability through
hiring staff or contracting for assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Indian housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An IHA has modernization capability if it is capable of effectively carrying out the proposed modernization improvements.
Where an IHA does not have a funded modernization program in progress, the ONAP shall determine whether the IHA has
a reasonable prospect of acquiring modernization capability through hiring staff or contracting for assistance.

(4) Technical processing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the Field Office has categorized the eligible HAs and their developments into Group 1 and Group 2, the Field Office
shall rate all Group 2 HAs on each of the technical review factors in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph. With the exception
of the technical review factor of ``extent and urgency of need'', a Group 2 HA is rated on its overall HA application
and not on each development. For the technical review factor of ``extent and urgency of need,'' each development for
which funding is requested by a Group 2 HA is scored; the development with the highest priority needs is scored the highest
number of points, which is then used for the overall HA score on that factor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
High priority needs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are non-emergency needs, but related to: Health or safety; vacant, substandard units; structural or system integrity;
or compliance with statutory, regulatory or court-ordered deadlines.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Field Office shall select HAs, including all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Group 1 HAs, for Joint Review so that the total dollar value of all proposed modernization recommended for funding
exceeds the subassignment amount by at least 15%. This will preserve the Field Office's ability to adjust cost estimates
and work items as a result of Joint Review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Field Office shall notify in writing each HA whose application has been selected for further processing as
to whether the Joint Review will be conducted on-site or off-site (e.g., by telephone or in-office meeting). An HA
will not be selected for Joint Review if other funding is available (refer to section V(g)). The Field Office shall
notify in writing each HA not selected for Joint Review and provide the reasons for non-selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Where the HA has not included some of its developments in the CIAP Application, the Field Office may not, as a result
of Joint Review, consider funding any non-emergency work at excluded developments or subsequently approve use of
leftover funds at excluded developments. Therefore, to provide maximum flexibility, the HA may wish to include all
of its developments in the CIAP Application, even though there are no current needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The HA shall prepare for the Joint Review by preparing a draft CIAP budget, and reviewing the other items to be covered
during the Joint Review, such as the need for professional services, method of accomplishment of physical work (contract
or force account labor), HA compliance with various Federal statutes and regulations, etc. If conducted on-site,
the Joint Review may include an inspection of the proposed physical work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After all Joint Reviews are completed, the Field Office shall adjust the HAs, developments, and work items to be funded
and the amounts to be awarded, on the basis of information obtained from Joint Reviews, environmental reviews, and
FHEO review. Such adjustments are necessary where Joint Review determines that actual Group 1 emergencies and Group
2 high priority needs, HA priorities, or cost estimates vary from the HA's application. Such adjustments may preclude
the Field Office from funding all of the higher ranked HA applications. However, where the information obtained from
Joint Reviews, environmental reviews, and FHEO review does not substantially alter the information used to establish
the rankings before Joint Review, the Field Office shall make funding decisions in accordance with its rankings.
The Field Office shall then announce the HAs selected for CIAP grants, subject to their submission of an approvable
CIAP budget and other required documents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Before an HA may be approved for Other Modernization of a unit under this paragraph, it must first deplete any Earned
Home Payments Account (EHPA) or Non-Routine Maintenance Reserve (NRMR) pertaining to the unit, and request the maximum
operating subsidy. Any increase in the value of a unit caused by its Other Modernization under this paragraph shall
be reflected solely by its subsequent appraised value, and not by an automatic increase in its purchase price.

(d) In-Place Management (Interim Containment of LBP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the results of the professional risk assessment recommend that the HA undertake in-place management measures,
the HA is strongly encouraged to apply for CIAP funds to carry out such measures. However, if the HA is not successful
in obtaining CIAP funds for in-place management measures, the HA may request a budget revision of previously approved,
but unobligated CIAP funds to accomplish such measures. Where the HA had a CIAP budget revision approved for this purpose
in FY 1993, the HA may request FY 1994 CIAP funds to complete the items which were eliminated as a result of the budget
revision.

(e) Long-Term Viability and Reasonable Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On Form HUD&hyph;52822, CIAP Application, the HA shall indicate whether the developments proposed for modernization
have long-term viability, including prospects for full occupancy. During Joint Review, the Field Office shall determine
whether the estimated costs are reasonable for the proposed work items and, if not, adjust the costs. The Field Office
shall review estimated costs against national indices, adjusted to reflect local conditions, such as R.S. Means
Index, the Dodge Report or Marshall and Swift, as well as using actual, local experience. The Field Office is no longer
required to compare estimated modernization costs against computed Total Development Cost (TDC) limits. Where
the HA or Field Office believes that a particular development may not have long-term viability, the Field Office shall
make a final viability determination, using the following criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any special or unusual conditions have been adequately explained, all work has been justified as necessary to
meet the modernization and energy conservation standards, including development specific work necessary to blend
the development in with the design and architecture of the neighborhood; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasonable cost estimates have been provided, and every effort has been made to reduce costs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rehabilitation of the existing development is more cost-effective in the long-term than construction or acquisition
of replacement housing; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There are no practical alternatives for replacement housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

(1) Where available, authorized residual receipts or debt forgiveness replacement reserve funds shall be used in
lieu of CIAP funds. Residual receipts may be retained for only two years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The HA shall not receive duplicate funding for the same work item or activity under any circumstance and shall establish
controls to assure that an activity, program, or project that is funded under any other HUD program, shall not be funded
by CIAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A building which is assisted with Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Projects (MROP) funding after FY 1988 which
has not yet reached Date of Full Availability (DOFA) is not eligible for CIAP funding. A building which was assisted
with MROP funding during FYs 1986&hyph;1988 which has not yet expended all MROP funds is not eligible for CIAP funding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has promulgated a final rule to implement section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 12. Section 102 contains a number of provisions
that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types of assistance
administered by the Department. On January 16, 1992, the Department published at 57 FR 1942, additional information
that gave the public (including applicants for, and recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation,
public access, and disclosure requirements of section 102. The documentation, public access, and disclosure requirements
of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(e) Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the HUD Reform Act, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition
announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful
applicants. Also refer to a final rule amending part 4 published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 61016), regarding the regulation of certain conduct by HUD employees and by applicants
for HUD assistance during the selection process for the award of financial assistance by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by part 4 from
providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions,
or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this
competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR Part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics at (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice), (202) 708&hyph;1112
(TDD). These are not toll-free numbers. The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees,
as well. However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can
be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Field Office Counsel or Headquarters
Counsel for the program to which the question pertains.

(f) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.
3531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) . Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial
assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those
who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those
who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the
award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance
received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD regulations implementing section 13 are at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the
Department in these ways, they are urged to read the regulation, particularly the examples contained in appendix
A of the rule.

(g) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
HUD implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IHAs established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage
of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the amount applied for is greater than $100,000, the certification is required at the time application for funds
is made that federally appropriated funds are not being or have been used in violation of the Byrd Amendment. If the
amount applied for is greater than $100,000 and the HA has made or has agreed to make any payment using nonappropriated
funds for lobbying activity, as described in 24 CFR Part 87 (Byrd Amendment), the submission also must include the
SF&hyph;LLL, Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. The HA determines if the submission of the SF&hyph;LLL is applicable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The main purposes of the CSO Control Policy are to elaborate on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National
CSO Control Strategy published on September 8, 1989, at 54 FR 37370, and to expedite compliance with the requirements
of the Clean Water Act (CWA). While implementation of the 1989 Strategy has resulted in progress toward controlling
CSOs, significant public health and water quality risks remain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Policy provides guidance to permittees with CSOs, NPDES authorities and State water quality standards authorities
on coordinating the planning, selection, and implementation of CSO controls that meet the requirements of the CWA
and allow for public involvement during the decision-making process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contained in the Policy are provisions for developing appropriate, site-specific NPDES permit requirements for
all combined sewer systems (CSS) that overflow as a result of wet weather events. For example, the Policy lays out two
alternative approaches_the ``demonstration'' and the ``presumption'' approaches_that provide communities
with targets for CSO controls that achieve compliance with the Act, particularly protection of water quality and
designated uses. The Policy also includes enforcement initiatives to require the immediate elimination of overflows
that occur during dry weather and to ensure that the remaining CWA requirements are complied with as soon as practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The permitting provisions of the Policy were developed as a result of extensive input received from key stakeholders
during a negotiated policy dialogue. The CSO stakeholders included representatives from States, environmental
groups, municipal organizations and others. The negotiated dialogue was conducted during the Summer of 1992 by the
Office of Water and the Office of Water's Management Advisory Group. The enforcement initiatives, including one
which is underway to address CSOs during dry weather, were developed by EPA's Office of Water and Office of Enforcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA issued a Notice of Availability on the draft CSO Control Policy on January 19, 1993, (58 FR 4994) and requested comments
on the draft Policy by March 22, 1993. Approximately forty-one sets of written comments were submitted by a variety
of interest groups including cities and municipal groups, environmental groups, States, professional organizations
and others. All comments were considered as EPA prepared the Final Policy. The public comments were largely supportive
of the draft Policy. EPA received broad endorsement of and support for the key principles and provisions from most
commenters. Thus, this final Policy does not include significant changes to the major provisions of the draft Policy,
but rather, it includes clarification and better explanation of the elements of the Policy to address several of the
questions that were raised in the comments. Persons wishing to obtain copies of the public comments or EPA's summary
analysis of the comments may write or call the EPA contact person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CSO Policy represents a comprehensive national strategy to ensure that municipalities, permitting authorities,
water quality standards authorities and the public engage in a comprehensive and coordinated planning effort to
achieve cost effective CSO controls that ultimately meet appropriate health and environmental objectives. The
Policy recognizes the site-specific nature of CSOs and their impacts and provides the necessary flexibility to tailor
controls to local situations. Major elements of the Policy ensure that CSO controls are cost effective and meet the
objectives and requirements of the CWA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major provisions of the Policy are as follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSO permittees should immediately undertake a process to accurately characterize their CSS and CSO discharges,
demonstrate implementation of minimum technology-based controls identified in the Policy, and develop long-term
CSO control plans which evaluate alternatives for attaining compliance with the CWA, including compliance with
water quality standards and protection of designated uses. Once the long-term CSO control plans are completed, permittees
will be responsible to implement the plans' recommendations as soon as practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State water quality standards authorities will be involved in the long-term CSO control planning effort as well.
The water quality standards authorities will help ensure that development of the CSO permittees' long-term CSO control
plans are coordinated with the review and possible revision of water quality standards on CSO-impacted waters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPDES authorities will issue/reissue or modify permits, as appropriate, to require compliance with the technology-based
and water quality-based requirements of the CWA. After completion of the long-term CSO control plan, NPDES permits
will be reissued or modified to incorporate the additional requirements specified in the Policy, such as performance
standards for the selected controls based on average design conditions, a post-construction water quality assessment
program, monitoring for compliance with water quality standards, and a reopener clause authorizing the NPDES authority
to reopen and modify the permit if it is determined that the CSO controls fail to meet water quality standards or protect
designated uses. NPDES authorities should commence enforcement actions against permittees that have CWA violations
due to CSO discharges during dry weather. In addition, NPDES authorities should ensure the implementation of the
minimum technology-based controls and incorporate a schedule into an appropriate enforceable mechanism, with
appropriate milestone dates, to implement the required long-term CSO control plan. Schedules for implementation
of the long-term CSO control plan may be phased based on the relative importance of adverse impacts upon water quality
standards and designated uses, and on a permittee's financial capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is developing extensive guidance to support the Policy and will announce the availability of the guidances and
other outreach efforts through various means, as they become available. For example, EPA is preparing guidance on
the nine minimum controls, characterization and monitoring of CSOs, development of long-term CSO control plans,
and financial capability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permittees will be expected to comply with any existing CSO-related requirements in NPDES permits, consent decrees
or court orders unless revised to be consistent with this Policy.

Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Purpose and Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The main purposes of this Policy are to elaborate on EPA's National Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Strategy
published on September 8, 1989 at 54 FR 37370 (1989 Strategy) and to expedite compliance with the requirements of the
Clean Water Act (CWA). While implementation of the 1989 Strategy has resulted in progress toward controlling CSOs,
significant water quality risks remain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A combined sewer system (CSS) is a wastewater collection system owned by a State or municipality (as defined by section
502(4) of the CWA) which conveys sanitary wastewaters (domestic, commercial and industrial wastewaters) and storm
water through a single-pipe system to a Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) Treatment Plant (as defined in 40 CFR
403.3(p)). A CSO is the discharge from a CSS at a point prior to the POTW Treatment Plant. CSOs are point sources subject
to NPDES permit requirements including both technology-based and water quality-based requirements of the CWA.
CSOs are not subject to secondary treatment requirements applicable to POTWs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSOs consist of mixtures of domestic sewage, industrial and commercial wastewaters, and storm water runoff. CSOs
often contain high levels of suspended solids, pathogenic microorganisms, toxic pollutants, floatables, nutrients,
oxygen-demanding organic compounds, oil and grease, and other pollutants. CSOs can cause exceedances of water quality
standards (WQS). Such exceedances may pose risks to human health, threaten aquatic life and its habitat, and impair
the use and enjoyment of the Nation's waterways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Policy is intended to provide guidance to permittees with CSOs, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permitting authorities, State water quality standards authorities and enforcement authorities. The purpose
of the Policy is to coordinate the planning, selection, design and implementation of CSO management practices and
controls to meet the requirements of the CWA and to involve the public fully during the decision making process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Policy reiterates the objectives of the 1989 Strategy: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. To ensure that if CSOs occur, they are only as a result of wet weather; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To bring all wet weather CSO discharge points into compliance with the technology-based and water quality-based
requirements of the CWA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To minimize water quality, aquatic biota, and human health impacts from CSOs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This CSO Control Policy represents a comprehensive national strategy to ensure that municipalities, permitting
authorities, water quality standards authorities and the public engage in a comprehensive and coordinated planning
effort to achieve cost-effective CSO controls that ultimately meet appropriate health and environmental objectives
and requirements. The Policy recognizes the site-specific nature of CSOs and their impacts and provides the necessary
flexibility to tailor controls to local situations. Four key principles of the Policy ensure that CSO controls are
cost-effective and meet the objectives of the CWA. The key principles are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Providing clear levels of control that would be presumed to meet appropriate health and environmental objectives;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Providing sufficient flexibility to municipalities, especially financially disadvantaged communities, to
consider the site-specific nature of CSOs and to determine the most cost-effective means of reducing pollutants
and meeting CWA objectives and requirements;

and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Review and revision, as appropriate, of water quality standards and their implementation procedures when developing
CSO control plans to reflect the site-specific wet weather impacts of CSOs.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Policy is being issued in support of EPA's regulations and policy initiatives. This Policy is Agency guidance
only and does not establish or affect legal rights or obligations. It does not establish a binding norm and is not finally
determinative of the issues addressed. Agency decisions in any particular case will be made by applying the law and
regulations on the basis of specific facts when permits are issued. The Administration has recommended that the 1994
amendments to the CWA endorse this final Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Application of Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permitting provisions of this Policy apply to all CSSs that overflow as a result of storm water flow, including
snow melt runoff (40 CFR 122.26(b)(13)). Discharges from CSSs during dry weather are prohibited by the CWA. Accordingly,
the permitting provisions of this Policy do not apply to CSOs during dry weather. Dry weather flow is the flow in a combined
sewer that results from domestic sewage, groundwater infiltration, commercial and industrial wastewaters, and
any other non-precipitation related flows (e.g., tidal infiltration). In addition to the permitting provisions,
the Enforcement and Compliance section of this Policy describes an enforcement initiative being developed for overflows
that occur during dry weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the 1989 Strategy, 30 States that submitted CSO permitting strategies have received EPA approval
or, in the case of one State, conditional approval of its strategy. States and EPA Regional Offices should review these
strategies and negotiate appropriate revisions to them to implement this Policy. Permitting authorities are encouraged
to evaluate water pollution control needs on a watershed management basis and coordinate CSO control efforts with
other point and nonpoint source control activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Effect on Current CSO Control Efforts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA recognizes that extensive work has been done by many Regions, States, and municipalities to abate CSOs. As such,
portions of this Policy may already have been addressed by permittees' previous efforts to control CSOs. Therefore,
portions of this Policy may not apply, as determined by the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis, under the
following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Any permittee that, on the date of publication of this final Policy, has completed or substantially completed construction
of CSO control facilities that are designed to meet WQS and protect designated uses, and where it has been determined
that WQS are being or will be attained, is not covered by the initial planning and construction provisions in this Policy;
however, the operational plan and post-construction monitoring provisions continue to apply. If, after monitoring,
it is determined that WQS are not being attained, the permittee should be required to submit a revised CSO control plan
that, once implemented, will attain WQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Any permittee that, on the date of publication of this final Policy, has substantially developed or is implementing
a CSO control program pursuant to an existing permit or enforcement order, and such program is considered by the NPDES
permitting authority to be adequate to meet WQS and protect designated uses and is reasonably equivalent to the treatment
objectives of this Policy, should complete those facilities without further planning activities otherwise expected
by this Policy. Such programs, however, should be reviewed and modified to be consistent with the sensitive area,
financial capability, and post-construction monitoring provisions of this Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Any permittee that has previously constructed CSO control facilities in an effort to comply with WQS but has failed
to meet such applicable standards or to protect designated uses due to remaining CSOs may receive consideration for
such efforts in future permits or enforceable orders for long-term CSO control planning, design and implementation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of any ongoing or substantially completed CSO control effort, the NPDES permit or other enforceable mechanism,
as appropriate, should be revised to include all appropriate permit requirements consistent with Section IV.B.
of this Policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Small System Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of the long-term CSO control plan, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization, monitoring and modeling, and evaluation of alternatives portions of this Policy may be difficult
for some small CSSs. At the discretion of the NPDES Authority, jurisdictions with populations under 75,000 may not
need to complete each of the formal steps outlined in Section II.C. of this Policy, but should be required through their
permits or other enforceable mechanisms to comply with the nine minimum controls (II.B), public participation (II.C.2),
and sensitive areas (II.C.3) portions of this Policy. In addition, the permittee may propose to implement any of the
criteria contained in this Policy for evaluation of alternatives described in II.C.4. Following approval of the
proposed plan, such jurisdictions should construct the control projects and propose a monitoring program sufficient
to determine whether WQS are attained and designated uses are protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing long-term CSO control plans based on the small system considerations discussed in the preceding paragraph,
permittees are encouraged to discuss the scope of their long-term CSO control plan with the WQS authority and the NPDES
authority. These discussions will ensure that the plan includes sufficient information to enable the permitting
authority to identify the appropriate CSO controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Implementation Responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NPDES authorities (authorized States or EPA Regional Offices, as appropriate) are responsible for implementing
this Policy. It is their responsibility to assure that CSO permittees develop long-term CSO control plans and that
NPDES permits meet the requirements of the CWA. Further, they are responsible for coordinating the review of the long-term
CSO control plan and the development of the permit with the WQS authority to determine if revisions to the WQS are appropriate.
In addition, they should determine the appropriate vehicle (i.e., permit reissuance, information request under
CWA section 308 or State equivalent or enforcement action) to ensure that compliance with the CWA is achieved as soon
as practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permittees are responsible for documenting the implementation of the nine minimum controls and developing and implementing
a long-term CSO control plan, as described in this Policy. EPA recognizes that financial considerations are a major
factor affecting the implementation of CSO controls. For that reason, this Policy allows consideration of a permittee's
financial capability in connection with the long-term CSO control planning effort, WQS review, and negotiation
of enforceable schedules. However, each permittee is ultimately responsible for aggressively pursuing financial
arrangements for the implementation of its long-term CSO control plan. As part of this effort, communities should
apply to their State Revolving Fund program, or other assistance programs as appropriate, for financial assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and the States will undertake action to assure that all permittees with CSSs are subject to a consistent review
in the permit development process, have permit requirements that achieve compliance with the CWA, and are subject
to enforceable schedules that require the earliest practicable compliance date considering physical and financial
feasibility.

F. Policy Development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Policy devotes a separate section to each step involved in developing and implementing CSO controls. This is
not to imply that each function occurs separately. Rather, the entire process surrounding CSO controls, community
planning, WQS and permit development/revision, enforcement/compliance actions and public participation must
be coordinated to control CSOs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively. Permittees and permitting authorities are encouraged to consider innovative and alternative approaches
and technologies that achieve the objectives of this Policy and the CWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing this Policy, EPA has included information on what responsible parties are expected to accomplish.
Subsequent documents will provide additional guidance on how the objectives of this Policy should be met. These documents
will provide further guidance on: CSO permit writing, the nine minimum controls, long-term CSO control plans, financial
capability, sewer system characterization and receiving water monitoring and modeling, and application of WQS
to CSO-impacted waters. For most CSO control efforts however, sufficient detail has been included in this Policy
to begin immediate implementation of its provisions.

II. EPA Objectives for Permittees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permittees with CSSs that have CSOs should immediately undertake a process to accurately characterize their sewer
systems, to demonstrate implementation of the nine minimum controls, and to develop a long-term CSO control plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Implementation of the Nine Minimum Controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permittees with CSOs should submit appropriate documentation demonstrating implementation of the nine minimum
controls, including any proposed schedules for completing minor construction activities. The nine minimum controls
are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proper operation and regular maintenance programs for the sewer system and the CSOs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Maximum use of the collection system for storage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Review and modification of pretreatment requirements to assure CSO impacts are minimized; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Maximization of flow to the POTW for treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Prohibition of CSOs during dry weather; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Control of solid and floatable materials in CSOs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Pollution prevention; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Public notification to ensure that the public receives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate notification of CSO occurrences and CSO impacts; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Monitoring to effectively characterize CSO impacts and the efficacy of CSO controls. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Selection and implementation of actual control measures should be based on site-specific considerations including
the specific CSS's characteristics discussed under the sewer system characterization and monitoring portions
of this Policy. Documentation of the nine minimum controls may include operation and maintenance plans, revised
sewer use ordinances for industrial users, sewer system inspection reports, infiltration/inflow studies, pollution
prevention programs, public notification plans, and facility plans for maximizing the capacities of the existing
collection, storage and treatment systems, as well as contracts and schedules for minor construction programs for
improving the existing system's operation. The permittee should also submit any information or data on the degree
to which the nine minimum controls achieve compliance with water quality standards. These data and information should
include results made available through monitoring and modeling activities done in conjunction with the development
of the long-term CSO control plan described in this Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This documentation should be submitted as soon as practicable, but no later than two years after the requirement to
submit such documentation is included in an NPDES permit or other enforceable mechanism. Implementation of the nine
minimum controls with appropriate documentation should be completed as soon as practicable but no later than January
1, 1997. These dates should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the CWA requires immediate compliance with technology-based controls (section 301(b)), which on a Best
Professional Judgment basis should include the nine minimum controls, a compliance schedule for implementing the
nine minimum controls, if necessary, should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Long-Term CSO Control Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permittees with CSOs are responsible for developing and implementing long-term CSO control plans that will ultimately
result in compliance with the requirements of the CWA. The long-term plans should consider the site-specific nature
of CSOs and evaluate the cost effectiveness of a range of control options/strategies. The development of the long-term
CSO control plan and its subsequent implementation should also be coordinated with the NPDES authority and the State
authority responsible for reviewing and revising the State's WQS. The selected controls should be designed to allow
cost effective expansion or cost effective retrofitting if additional controls are subsequently determined to
be necessary to meet WQS, including existing and designated uses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This policy identifies EPA's major objectives for the long-term CSO control plan. Permittees should develop and
submit this long-term CSO control plan as soon as practicable, but generally within two years after the date of the
NPDES permit provision, Section 308 information request, or enforcement action requiring the permittee to develop
the plan. NPDES authorities may establish a longer timetable for completion of the long-term CSO control plan on a
case-by-case basis to account for site-specific factors which may influence the complexity of the planning process.
Once agreed upon, these dates should be included in an appropriate enforceable mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects each long-term CSO control plan to utilize appropriate information to address the following minimum
elements. The Plan should also include both fixed-date project implementation schedules (which may be phased) and
a financing plan to design and construct the project as soon as practicable. The minimum elements of the long-term
CSO control plan are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Characterization, Monitoring, and Modeling of the Combined Sewer System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to design a CSO control plan adequate to meet the requirements of the CWA, a permittee should have a thorough
understanding of its sewer system, the response of the system to various precipitation events, the characteristics
of the overflows, and the water quality impacts that result from CSOs. The permittee should adequately characterize
through monitoring, modeling, and other means as appropriate, for a range of storm events, the response of its sewer
system to wet weather events including the number, location and frequency of CSOs, volume, concentration and mass
of pollutants discharged and the impacts of the CSOs on the receiving waters and their designated uses. The permittee
may need to consider information on the contribution and importance of other pollution sources in order to develop
a final plan designed to meet water quality standards. The purpose of the system characterization, monitoring and
modeling program initially is to assist the permittee in developing appropriate measures to implement the nine minimum
controls and, if necessary, to support development of the long-term CSO control plan. The monitoring and modeling
data also will be used to evaluate the expected effectiveness of both the nine minimum controls and, if necessary,
the long-term CSO controls, to meet WQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major elements of a sewer system characterization are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Rainfall Records_The permittee should examine the complete rainfall record for the geographic area of its existing
CSS using sound statistical procedures and best available data. The permittee should evaluate flow variations in
the receiving water body to correlate between CSOs and receiving water conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Combined Sewer System Characterization_The permittee should evaluate the nature and extent of its sewer system
through evaluation of available sewer system records, field inspections and other activities necessary to understand
the number, location and frequency of overflows and their location relative to sensitive areas and to pollution sources
in the collection system, such as indirect significant industrial users.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. CSO Monitoring_The permittee should develop a comprehensive, representative monitoring program that measures
the frequency, duration, flow rate, volume and pollutant concentration of CSO discharges and assesses the impact
of the CSOs on the receiving waters. The monitoring program should include necessary CSO effluent and ambient in-stream
monitoring and, where appropriate, other monitoring protocols such as biological assessment, toxicity testing
and sediment sampling. Monitoring parameters should include, for example, oxygen demanding pollutants, nutrients,
toxic pollutants, sediment contaminants, pathogens, bacteriological indicators (e.g., Enterococcus, E. Coli),
and toxicity. A representative sample of overflow points can be selected that is sufficient to allow characterization
of CSO discharges and their water quality impacts and to facilitate evaluation of control plan alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Modeling_Modeling of a sewer system is recognized as a valuable tool for predicting sewer system response to various
wet weather events and assessing water quality impacts when evaluating different control strategies and alternatives.
EPA supports the proper and effective use of models, where appropriate, in the evaluation of the nine minimum controls
and the development of the long-term CSO control plan. It is also recognized that there are many models which may be
used to do this. These models range from simple to complex. Having decided to use a model, the permittee should base
its choice of a model on the characteristics of its sewer system, the number and location of overflow points, and the
sensitivity of the receiving water body to the CSO discharges. Use of models should include appropriate calibration
and verification with field measurements. The sophistication of the model should relate to the complexity of the
system to be modeled and to the information needs associated with evaluation of CSO control options and water quality
impacts. EPA believes that continuous simulation models, using historical rainfall data, may be the best way to model
sewer systems, CSOs, and their impacts. Because of the iterative nature of modeling sewer systems, CSOs, and their
impacts, monitoring and modeling efforts are complementary and should be coordinated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing its long-term CSO control plan, the permittee will employ a public participation process that actively
involves the affected public in the decision-making to select the long-term CSO controls. The affected public includes
rate payers, industrial users of the sewer system, persons who reside downstream from the CSOs, persons who use and
enjoy these downstream waters, and any other interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Consideration of Sensitive Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA expects a permittee's long-term CSO control plan to give the highest priority to controlling overflows to sensitive
areas. Sensitive areas, as determined by the NPDES authority in coordination with State and Federal agencies, as
appropriate, include designated Outstanding National Resource Waters, National Marine Sanctuaries, waters with
threatened or endangered species and their habitat, waters with primary contact recreation, public drinking water
intakes or their designated protection areas, and shellfish beds. For such areas, the long-term CSO control plan
should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Prohibit new or significantly increased overflows; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. i. Eliminate or relocate overflows that discharge to sensitive areas wherever physically possible and economically
achievable, except where elimination or relocation would provide less environmental protection than additional
treatment; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Where elimination or relocation is not physically possible and economically achievable, or would provide less
environmental protection than additional treatment, provide the level of treatment for remaining overflows deemed
necessary to meet WQS for full protection of existing and designated uses. In any event, the level of control should
not be less than those described in Evaluation of Alternatives below; and

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Where elimination or relocation has been proven not to be physically possible and economically achievable, permitting
authorities should require, for each subsequent permit term, a reassessment based on new or improved techniques
to eliminate or relocate, or on changed circumstances that influence economic achievability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Evaluation of Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA expects the long-term CSO control plan to consider a reasonable range of alternatives. The plan should, for example,
evaluate controls that would be necessary to achieve zero overflow events per year, an average of one to three, four
to seven, and eight to twelve overflow events per year. Alternatively, the long-term plan could evaluate controls
that achieve 100% capture, 90% capture, 85% capture, 80% capture, and 75% capture for treatment. The long-term control
plan should also consider expansion of POTW secondary and primary capacity in the CSO abatement alternative analysis.
The analysis of alternatives should be sufficient to make a reasonable assessment of cost and performance as described
in Section II.C.5. Because the final long-term CSO control plan will become the basis for NPDES permit limits and requirements,
the selected controls should be sufficient to meet CWA requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to considering sensitive areas, the long-term CSO control plan should adopt one of the following approaches:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. ``Presumption'' Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A program that meets any of the criteria listed below would be presumed to provide an adequate level of control to meet
the water quality-based requirements of the CWA, provided the permitting authority determines that such presumption
is reasonable in light of the data and analysis conducted in the characterization, monitoring, and modeling of the
system and the consideration of sensitive areas described above. These criteria are provided because data and modeling
of wet weather events often do not give a clear picture of the level of CSO controls necessary to protect WQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. No more than an average of four overflow events per year, provided that the permitting authority may allow up to two
additional overflow events per year. For the purpose of this criterion, an overflow event is one or more overflows
from a CSS as the result of a precipitation event that does not receive the minimum treatment specified below; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The elimination or the capture for treatment of no less than 85% by volume of the combined sewage collected in the
CSS during precipitation events on a system-wide annual average basis; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The elimination or removal of no less than the mass of the pollutants, identified as causing water quality impairment
through the sewer system characterization, monitoring, and modeling effort, for the volumes that would be eliminated
or captured for treatment under paragraph ii. above.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Combined sewer flows remaining after implementation of the nine minimum controls and within the criteria specified
at II.C.4.a.i or ii, should receive a minimum of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Primary clarification (Removal of floatables and settleable solids may be achieved by any combination of
treatment technologies or methods that are shown to be equivalent to primary clarification.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Solids and floatables disposal; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disinfection of effluent, if necessary, to meet WQS, protect designated uses and protect human health, including
removal of harmful disinfection chemical residuals, where necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. ``Demonstration'' Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A permittee may demonstrate that a selected control program, though not meeting the criteria specified in II.C.4.a.
above is adequate to meet the water quality-based requirements of the CWA. To be a successful demonstration, the permittee
should demonstrate each of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The planned control program is adequate to meet WQS and protect designated uses, unless WQS or uses cannot be met
as a result of natural background conditions or pollution sources other than CSOs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The CSO discharges remaining after implementation of the planned control program will not preclude the attainment
of WQS or the receiving waters' designated uses or contribute to their impairment. Where WQS and designated uses are
not met in part because of natural background conditions or pollution sources other than CSOs, a total maximum daily
load, including a wasteload allocation and a load allocation, or other means should be used to apportion pollutant
loads; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The planned control program will provide the maximum pollution reduction benefits reasonably attainable;
and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
iv. The planned control program is designed to allow cost effective expansion or cost effective retrofitting if additional
controls are subsequently determined to be necessary to meet WQS or designated uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Cost/Performance Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permittee should develop appropriate cost/performance curves to demonstrate the relationships among a comprehensive
set of reasonable control alternatives that correspond to the different ranges specified in Section II.C.4. This
should include an analysis to determine where the increment of pollution reduction achieved in the receiving water
diminishes compared to the increased costs. This analysis, often known as knee of the curve, should be among the considerations
used to help guide selection of controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Operational Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After agreement between the permittee and NPDES authority on the necessary CSO controls to be implemented under the
long-term CSO control plan, the permittee should revise the operation and maintenance program developed as part
of the nine minimum controls to include the agreed-upon long-term CSO controls. The revised operation and maintenance
program should maximize the removal of pollutants during and after each precipitation event using all available
facilities within the collection and treatment system. For any flows in excess of the criteria specified at II.C.4.a.i.,
ii. or iii and not receiving the treatment specified in II.C.4.a, the operational plan should ensure that such flows
receive treatment to the greatest extent practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Maximizing Treatment at the Existing POTW Treatment Plant
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In some communities, POTW treatment plants may have primary treatment capacity in excess of their secondary treatment
capacity. One effective strategy to abate pollution resulting from CSOs is to maximize the delivery of flows during
wet weather to the POTW treatment plant for treatment. Delivering these flows can have two significant water quality
benefits: First, increased flows during wet weather to the POTW treatment plant may enable the permittee to eliminate
or minimize overflows to sensitive areas; second, this would maximize the use of available POTW facilities for wet
weather flows and would ensure that combined sewer flows receive at least primary treatment prior to discharge.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under EPA regulations, the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility, including
secondary treatment, is a bypass. EPA bypass regulations at 40 CFR 122.41(m) allow for a facility to bypass some or
all the flow from its treatment process under specified limited circumstances. Under the regulation, the permittee
must show that the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage, that
there was no feasible alternative to the bypass and that the permittee submitted the required notices. In addition,
the regulation provides that a bypass may be approved only after consideration of adverse effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, it is the responsibility of the permittee to document, on a case-by-base basis, compliance with 40 CFR 122.41(m)
in order to bypass flows legally. For some CSO-related permits, the study of feasible alternatives in the control
plan may provide sufficient support for the permit record and for approval of a CSO-related bypass in the permit itself,
and to define the specific parameters under which a bypass can legally occur. For approval of a CSO-related bypass,
the long-term CSO control plan, at a minimum, should provide justification for the cut-off point at which the flow
will be diverted from the secondary treatment portion of the treatment plant, and provide a benefit-cost analysis
demonstrating that conveyance of wet weather flow to the POTW for primary treatment is more beneficial than other
CSO abatement alternatives such as storage and pump back for secondary treatment, sewer separation, or satellite
treatment. Such a permit must define under what specific wet weather conditions a CSO-related bypass is allowed and
also specify what treatment or what monitoring, and effluent limitations and requirements apply to the bypass flow.
The permit should also provide that approval for the CSO-related bypass will be reviewed and may be modified or terminated
if there is a substantial increase in the volume or character of pollutants being introduced to the POTW. The CSO-related
bypass provision in the permit should also make it clear that all wet weather flows passing the headworks of the POTW
treatment plant will receive at least primary clarification and solids and floatables removal and disposal, and
disinfection, where necessary, and any other treatment that can reasonably be provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, EPA would allow a permit to authorize a CSO-related bypass of the secondary treatment portion
of the POTW treatment plant for combined sewer flows in certain identified circumstances. This provision would apply
only to those situations where the POTW would ordinarily meet the requirements of 40 CFR 122.41(m) as evaluated on
a case-by-case basis. Therefore, there must be sufficient data in the administrative record (reflected in the permit
fact sheet or statement of basis) supporting all the requirements in 40 CFR 122.41(m)(4) for approval of an anticipated
bypass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of applying this regulation to CSO permittees, ``severe property damage'' could include situations
where flows above a certain level wash out the POTW's secondary treatment system. EPA further believes that the feasible
alternatives requirement of the regulation can be met if the record shows that the secondary treatment system is properly
operated and maintained, that the system has been designed to meet secondary limits for flows greater than the peak
dry weather flow, plus an appropriate quantity of wet weather flow, and that it is either technically or financially
infeasible to provide secondary treatment at the existing facilities for greater amounts of wet weather flow. The
feasible alternative analysis should include, for example, consideration of enhanced primary treatment (e.g.,
chemical addition) and non-biological secondary treatment. Other bases supporting a finding of no feasible alternative
may also be available on a case-by-case basis. As part of its consideration of possible adverse effects resulting
from the bypass, the permitting authority should also ensure that the bypass will not cause exceedances of WQS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Implementation Schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permittee should include all pertinent information in the long term control plan necessary to develop the construction
and financing schedule for implementation of CSO controls. Schedules for implementation of the CSO controls may
be phased based on the relative importance of adverse impacts upon WQS and designated uses, priority projects identified
in the long-term plan, and on a permittee's financial capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction phasing should consider: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Eliminating overflows that discharge to sensitive areas as the highest priority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Use impairment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The permittee's financial capability including consideration of such factors as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Median household income;

The selected CSO controls should include a post-construction water quality monitoring program adequate to verify
compliance with water quality standards and protection of designated uses as well as to ascertain the effectiveness
of CSO controls. This water quality compliance monitoring program should include a plan to be approved by the NPDES
authority that details the monitoring protocols to be followed, including the necessary effluent and ambient monitoring
and, where appropriate, other monitoring protocols such as biological assessments, whole effluent toxicity testing,
and sediment sampling.

A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
WQS are State adopted, or Federally promulgated rules which serve as the goals for the water body and the legal basis
for the water quality-based NPDES permit requirements under the CWA. WQS consist of uses which States designate for
their water bodies, criteria to protect the uses, an anti-degradation policy to protect the water quality improvements
gained and other policies affecting the implementation of the standards. A primary objective of the long-term CSO
control plan is to meet WQS, including the designated uses through reducing risks to human health and the environment
by eliminating, relocating or controlling CSOs to the affected waters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State WQS authorities, NPDES authorities, EPA regional offices, permittees, and the public should meet early and
frequently throughout the long-term CSO control planning process. Development of the long-term plan should be coordinated
with the review and appropriate revision of WQS and implementation procedures on CSO-impacted waters to ensure that
the long-term controls will be sufficient to meet water quality standards. As part of these meetings, participants
should agree on the data, information and analyses needed to support the development of the long-term CSO control
plan and the review of applicable WQS, and implementation procedures, if appropriate. Agreements should be reached
on the monitoring protocols and models that will be used to evaluate the water quality impacts of the overflows, to
analyze the attainability of the WQS and to determine the water quality-based requirements for the permit. Many opportunities
exist for permittees and States to share information as control programs are developed and as WQS are reviewed. Such
information should assist States in determining the need for revisions to WQS and implementation procedures to better
reflect the site-specific wet weather impacts of CSOs. Coordinating the development of the long-term CSO control
plan and the review of the WQS and implementation procedures provides greater assurance that the long-term control
plan selected and the limits and requirements included in the NPDES permit will be sufficient to meet WQS and to comply
with sections 301(b)(1)(C) and 402(a)(2) of the CWA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA encourages States and permittees jointly to sponsor workshops for the affected public in the development of the
long-term CSO control plan and during the development of appropriate revisions to WQS for CSO-impacted waters. Workshops
provide a forum for including the public in discussions of the implications of the proposed long-term CSO control
plan on the water quality and uses for the receiving water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Water Quality Standards Reviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CWA requires States to periodically, but at least once every three years, hold public hearings for the purpose
of reviewing applicable water quality standards and, as appropriate, modifying and adopting standards. States
must provide the public an opportunity to comment on any proposed revision to water quality standards and all revisions
must be submitted to EPA for review and approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA regulations and guidance provide States with the flexibility to adapt their WQS, and implementation procedures
to reflect site-specific conditions including those related to CSOs. For example, a State may adopt site-specific
criteria for a particular pollutant if the State determines that the site-specific criteria fully protects the designated
use (40 CFR 131.11). In addition, the regulations at 40 CFR 131.10(g), (h), and (j) specify when and how a designated
use may be modified. A State may remove a designated use from its water quality standards only if the designated use
is not an existing use. An existing use is a use actually attained in the water body on or after November 28, 1975. Furthermore,
a State may not remove a designated use that will be attained by implementing the technology-based effluent limits
required under sections 301(b) and 306 of the CWA and by implementing cost-effective and reasonable best management
practices for nonpoint source controls. Thus, if a State has a reasonable basis to determine that the current designated
use could be attained after implementation of the technology-based controls of the CWA, then the use could not be removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether a use is attainable and prior to removing a designated use, States must conduct and submit to
EPA a use attainability analysis. A use attainability analysis is a structured scientific assessment of the factors
affecting the use, including the physical, chemical, biological, and economic factors described in 40 CFR 131.10(g).
As part of the analysis, States should evaluate whether the designated use could be attained if CSO controls were implemented.
For example, States should examine if sediment loadings from CSOs could be reduced so as not to bury spawning beds,
or if biochemical oxygen demanding material in the effluent or the toxicity of the effluent could be corrected so as
to reduce the acute or chronic physiological stress on or bioaccumulation potential of aquatic organisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reviewing the attainability of their WQS and the applicability of their implementation procedures to CSO-impacted

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters, States are encouraged to define more explicitly their recreational and aquatic life uses and then, if appropriate,
modify the criteria accordingly to protect the designated uses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another option is for States to adopt partial uses by defining when primary contact recreation such as swimming does
not exist, such as during certain seasons of the year in northern climates or during a particular type of storm event.
In making such adjustments to their uses, States must ensure that downstream uses are protected, and that during other
seasons or after the storm event has passed, the use is fully protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to defining recreational uses with greater specificity, States are also encouraged to define the aquatic
uses more precisely. Rather than ``aquatic life use protection,'' States should consider defining the type of fishery
to be protected such as a cold water fishery (e.g., trout or salmon) or a warm weather fishery (e.g., bluegill or large
mouth bass). Explicitly defining the type of fishery to be protected may assist the permittee in enlisting the support
of citizens for a CSO control plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A water quality standard variance may be appropriate, in limited circumstances on CSO-impacted waters, where the
State is uncertain as to whether a standard can be attained and time is needed for the State to conduct additional analyses
on the attainability of the standard. Variances are short-term modifications in water quality standards. Subject
to EPA approval, States, with their own statutory authority, may grant a variance to a specific discharger for a specific
pollutant. The justification for a variance is similar to that required for a permanent change in the standard, although
the showings needed are less rigorous. Variances are also subject to public participation requirements of the water
quality standards and permits programs and are reviewable generally every three years. A variance allows the CSO
permit to be written to meet the ``modified'' water quality standard as analyses are conducted and as progress is made
to improve water quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justifications for variances are the same as those identified in 40 CFR 131.10(g) for modifications in uses. States
must provide an opportunity for public review and comment on all variances. If States use the permit as the vehicle
to grant the variance, notice of the permit must clearly state that the variance modifies the State's water quality
standards. If the variance is approved, the State appends the variance to the State's standards and reviews the variance
every three years.

A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CSOs are point sources subject to NPDES permit requirements including both technology-based and water quality-based
requirements of the CWA. CSOs are not subject to secondary treatment regulations applicable to publicly owned treatment
works (

646 F.2d 568 (D.C. Cir. 1980)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All permits for CSOs should require the nine minimum controls as a minimum best available technology economically
achievable and best conventional technology (BAT/BCT) established on a best professional judgment (BPJ) basis
by the permitting authority (40 CFR 125.3). Water quality-based requirements are to be established based on applicable
water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy establishes a uniform, nationally consistent approach to developing and issuing NPDES permits to permittees
with CSOs. Permits for CSOs should be developed and issued expeditiously. A single, system-wide permit generally
should be issued for all discharges, including CSOs, from a CSS operated by a single authority. When different parts
of a single CSS are operated by more than one authority, permits issued to each authority should generally require
joint preparation and implementation of the elements of this Policy and should specifically define the responsibilities
and duties of each authority. Permittees should be required to coordinate system-wide implementation of the nine
minimum controls and the development and implementation of the long-term CSO control plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The individual authorities are responsible for their own discharges and should cooperate with the permittee for
the POTW receiving the flows from the CSS. When a CSO is permitted separately from the POTW, both permits should be cross-referenced
for informational purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Regions and States should review the CSO permitting priorities established in the State CSO Permitting Strategies
developed in response to the 1989 Strategy. Regions and States may elect to revise these previous priorities. In setting
permitting priorities, Regions and States should not just focus on those permittees that have initiated monitoring
programs. When setting priorities, Regions and States should consider, for example, the known or potential impact
of CSOs on sensitive areas, and the extent of upstream industrial user discharges to the CSS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the permittee's development of the long-term CSO control plan, the permit writer should promote coordination
between the permittee and State WQS authority in connection with possible WQS revisions. Once the permittee has completed
development of the long-term CSO control plan and has coordinated with the permitting authority the selection of
the controls necessary to meet the requirements of the CWA, the permitting authority should include in an appropriate
enforceable mechanism, requirements for implementation of the long-term CSO control plan, including conditions
for water quality monitoring and operation and maintenance.

B. NPDES Permit Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following are the major elements of NPDES permits to implement this Policy and ensure protection of water quality.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Phase I Permits_Requirements for Demonstration of Implementation of the Nine Minimum Controls and Development
of the Long-Term CSO Control Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Phase I permit issued/modified to reflect this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Policy, the NPDES authority should at least require permittees to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Immediately implement BAT/BCT, which at a minimum includes the nine minimum controls, as determined on a BPJ basis
by the permitting authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Develop and submit a report documenting the implementation of the nine minimum controls within two years of permit
issuance/modification; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Comply with applicable WQS, no later than the date allowed under the State's WQS, expressed in the form of a narrative
limitation; and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
d. develop and submit, consistent with this Policy and based on a schedule in an appropriate enforceable mechanism,
a long-term CSO control plan as soon as practicable, but generally within two years after the effective date of the
permit issuance/ modification. However, permitting authorities may establish a longer timetable for completion
of the long-term CSO control plan on a case-by-case basis to account for site-specific factors that may influence
the complexity of the planning process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPDES authority should include compliance dates on the fastest practicable schedule for each of the nine minimum
controls in an appropriate enforceable mechanism issued in conjunction with the Phase I permit. The use of enforceable
orders is necessary unless Congress amends the CWA. All orders should require compliance with the nine minimum controls
no later than January 1, 1997.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Phase II Permits_Requirements for Implementation of a Long-Term CSO Control Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the permittee has completed development of the long-term CSO control plan and the selection of the controls necessary
to meet CWA requirements has been coordinated with the permitting and WQS authorities, the permitting authority
should include, in an appropriate enforceable mechanism, requirements for implementation of the long-term CSO
control plan as soon as practicable. Where the permittee has selected controls based on the ``presumption'' approach
described in Section II.C.4, the permitting authority must have determined that the presumption that such level
of treatment will achieve water quality standards is reasonable in light of the data and analysis conducted under
this Policy. The Phase II permit should contain:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Requirements to implement the technology-based controls including the nine minimum controls determined on a
BPJ basis;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Narrative requirements which insure that the selected CSO controls are implemented, operated and maintained
as described in the long-term CSO control plan;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Water quality-based effluent limits under 40 CFR 122.44(d)(1) and 122.44(k), requiring, at a minimum, compliance
with, no later than the date allowed under the State's WQS, the numeric performance standards for the selected CSO
controls, based on average design conditions specifying at least one of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. A maximum number of overflow events per year for specified design conditions consistent with II.C.4.a.i; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. A minimum percentage capture of combined sewage by volume for treatment under specified design conditions consistent
with II.C.4.a.ii; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. A minimum removal of the mass of pollutants discharged for specified design conditions consistent with II.C.4.a.iii;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. performance standards and requirements that are consistent with II.C.4.b. of the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. A requirement to implement, with an established schedule, the approved post-construction water quality assessment
program including requirements to monitor and collect sufficient information to demonstrate compliance with WQS
and protection of designated uses as well as to determine the effectiveness of CSO controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. A requirement to reassess overflows to sensitive areas in those cases where elimination or relocation of the overflows
is not physically possible and economically achievable. The reassessment should be based on consideration of new
or improved techniques to eliminate or relocate overflows or changed circumstances that influence economic achievability;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
f. Conditions establishing requirements for maximizing the treatment of wet weather flows at the POTW treatment
plant, as appropriate, consistent with Section II.C.7. of this Policy;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. A reopener clause authorizing the NPDES authority to reopen and modify the permit upon determination that the CSO
controls fail to meet WQS or protect designated uses. Upon such determination, the NPDES authority should promptly
notify the permittee and proceed to modify or reissue the permit. The permittee should be required to develop, submit
and implement, as soon as practicable, a revised CSO control plan which contains additional controls to meet WQS and
designated uses. If the initial CSO control plan was approved under the demonstration provision of Section II.C.4.b.,
the revised plan, at a minimum, should provide for controls that satisfy one of the criteria in Section II.C.4.a. unless
the permittee demonstrates that the revised plan is clearly adequate to meet WQS at a lower cost and it is shown that
the additional controls resulting from the criteria in Section II.C.4.a. will not result in a greater overall improvement
in water quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the permittee can comply with all of the requirements of the Phase II permit, the NPDES authority should include,
in an enforceable mechanism, compliance dates on the fastest practicable schedule for those activities directly
related to meeting the requirements of the CWA. For major permittees, the compliance schedule should be placed in
a judicial order. Proper compliance with the schedule for implementing the controls recommended in the long-term
CSO control plan constitutes compliance with the elements of this Policy concerning planning and implementation
of a long term CSO remedy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Phasing Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of CSO controls may be phased based on the relative importance of and adverse impacts upon WQS and designated
uses, as well as the permittee's financial capability and its previous efforts to control CSOs. The NPDES authority
should evaluate the proposed implementation schedule and construction phasing discussed in Section II.C.8. of
this Policy. The permit should require compliance with the controls proposed in the long-term CSO control plan no
later than the applicable deadline(s) under the CWA or State law. If compliance with the Phase II permit is not possible,
an enforceable schedule, consistent with the Enforcement and Compliance Section of this Policy, should be issued
in conjunction with the Phase II permit which specifies the schedule and milestones for implementation of the long-term
CSO control plan.

V. Enforcement and Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is important that permittees act immediately to take the necessary steps to comply with the CWA. The CSO enforcement
effort will commence with an initiative to address CSOs that discharge during dry weather, followed by an enforcement
effort in conjunction with permitting CSOs discussed earlier in this Policy. Success of the enforcement effort will
depend in large part upon expeditious action by NPDES authorities in issuing enforceable permits that include requirements
both for the nine minimum controls and for compliance with all other requirements of the CWA. Priority for enforcement
actions should be set based on environmental impacts or sensitive areas affected by CSOs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a further inducement for permittees to cooperate with this process, EPA is prepared to exercise its enforcement
discretion in determining whether or not to seek civil penalties for past CSO violations if permittees meet the objectives
and schedules of this Policy and do not have CSOs during dry weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Enforcement of CSO Dry Weather Discharge Prohibition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA intends to commence immediately an enforcement initiative against CSO permittees which have CWA violations
due to CSOs during dry weather. Discharges during dry weather have always been prohibited by the NPDES program. Such
discharges can create serious public health and water quality problems. EPA will use its CWA Section 308 monitoring,
reporting, and inspection authorities, together with NPDES State authorities, to locate these violations, and
to determine their causes. Appropriate remedies and penalties will be sought for CSOs during dry weather. EPA will
provide NPDES authorities more specific guidance on this enforcement initiative separately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Enforcement of Wet Weather CSO Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the CWA, EPA can use several enforcement options to address permittees with CSOs. Those options directly applicable
to this Policy are section 308 Information Requests, section 309(a) Administrative Orders, section 309(g) Administrative
Penalty Orders, section 309 (b) and (d) Civil Judicial Actions, and section 504 Emergency Powers. NPDES States should
use comparable means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPDES authorities should set priorities for enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on environmental impacts or sensitive areas affected by CSOs. Permittees that have voluntarily initiated
monitoring and are progressing expeditiously toward appropriate CSO controls should be given due consideration
for their efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Enforcement for Compliance With Phase I Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Enforcement for compliance with Phase I permits will focus on requirements to implement at least the nine minimum
controls, and develop the long-term CSO control plan leading to compliance with the requirements of the CWA. Where
immediate compliance with the Phase I permit is infeasible, the NPDES authority should issue an enforceable schedule,
in concert with the Phase I permit, requiring compliance with the CWA and imposing compliance schedules with dates
for each of the nine minimum controls as soon as practicable. All enforcement authorities should require compliance
with the nine minimum controls no later than January 1, 1997. Where the NPDES authority is issuing an order with a compliance
schedule for the nine minimum controls, this order should also include a schedule for development of the long-term
CSO control plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a CSO permittee fails to meet the final compliance date of the schedule, the NPDES authority should initiate appropriate
judicial action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Enforcement for Compliance With Phase II Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The main focus for enforcing compliance with Phase II permits will be to incorporate the long-term CSO control plan
through a civil judicial action, an administrative order, or other enforceable mechanism requiring compliance
with the CWA and imposing a compliance schedule with appropriate milestone dates necessary to implement the plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, a judicial order is the appropriate mechanism for incorporating the above provisions for Phase II. Administrative
orders, however, may be appropriate for permittees whose long-term control plans will take less than five years to
complete, and for minors that have complied with the final date of the enforceable order for compliance with their
Phase I permit. If necessary, any of the nine minimum controls that have not been implemented by this time should be
included in the terms of the judicial order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is prepared not to seek civil penalties for past CSO violations, if permittees have no discharges during dry weather
and meet the objectives and schedules of this Policy. Notwithstanding this, where a permittee has other significant
CWA violations for which EPA or the State is taking judicial action, penalties may be considered as part of that action
for the following:

EPA will not seek penalties for past CSO violations from permittees that fully comply with the Phase I permit or enforceable
order requiring compliance with the Phase I permit. For permittees that fail to comply, EPA will exercise its enforcement
discretion in determining whether to seek penalties for the time period for which the compliance schedule was violated.
If the milestone dates of the enforceable schedule are not achieved and penalties are sought, penalties should be
calculated from the last milestone date that was met.

At the time of the judicial settlement imposing a compliance schedule implementing the Phase II permit requirements,
EPA will not seek penalties for past CSO violations from permittees that fully comply with the enforceable order requiring
compliance with the Phase I permit and if the terms of the judicial order are expeditiously agreed to on consent. However,
stipulated penalties for violation of the judicial order generally should be included in the order, consistent with
existing Agency policies. Additional guidance on stipulated penalties concerning long-term CSO controls and attainment
of WQS will be issued.
