<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Food and Nutrition Service is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and has determined
that it is a ``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined
that this action: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not materially alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866.

The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551. For the reasons set
forth in the final rule and related notice(s) to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983), this Program
is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and
local officials.

This final rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this final rule
does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare agencies
will be the most affected to the extent that they may be required to modify application forms, add telephone access
information to their forms, and modify their verification procedures, however the effect on these entities will
be minimal. Participants and applicants will be affected by changes to the application and to procedures in reporting
medical expenses.

The reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the certification and continued eligibility of food stamp
households is approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 0584&hyph;0064.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The food stamp application, as approved under this OMB number, already contains several important verification
statements to the household. The requirement in 7 CFR 273.2(c)(5) that State agencies develop a separate written
general ``Notice of Verification'' versus including such information on the food stamp application or verbally
conveying such information to households does not alter or change the methodologies used to determine the burden
estimates approved under OMB control No. 0584&hyph;0064.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements in 7 CFR 272.2(a), 272.4(d), and 272.5 relative to the submission and updating of an optional ``Program
information activities planning document'' as part of a State agency's Plan of Operation have been submitted to OMB
and have been approved under OMB approval number 0584&hyph;0083. This rule amends the table at 7 CFR 271.8 ``Information
collection/recordkeeping_OMB assigned control numbers'' to reflect the OMB control number for the approval of
burden associated with 7 CFR 272.5 of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining provisions of this rule do not contain any reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements subject to
approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any State or local law, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``effective date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program, the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_State
administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative
procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities);
(3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at
7 CFR 278.8.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 7, 1989 the Department published an interim rulemaking at 54 FR 24518, which implemented several of the food
stamp provisions contained in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435). Comments were solicited
on the provisions of the interim rulemaking through August 7, 1989. The Department received 13 comment letters from
State and local welfare agencies and public interest groups. All comments received were reviewed and considered
but comments which were unclear or not pertinent to this rulemaking are not addressed in this preamble. For a full understanding
of the provisions of this final rule, the reader should refer to the preamble of the interim rule. The provisions of
the interim rule addressing specified procedures for claiming the medical deduction are not being finalized in this
rule. Those provisions will be addressed in a forthcoming proposed rule entitled Simplification of Program Rules.
Also, the provision of the interim rule addressing the delivery of benefits to households which apply after the fifteenth
of the month is not finalized in this rule but will be placed in final form in the forthcoming Benefit Delivery final
rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Elderly or Disabled_7 CFR 271.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 350 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 added three categories to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of elderly or disabled persons. These categories are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Recipients of interim assistance benefits pending the receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of supplemental security income (SSI); (2) recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disability-related medical assistance benefits under title XIX of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Social Security Act (SSA); and (3) recipients of disability-based State general assistance benefits. Recipients
of any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these benefits must be treated as disabled persons for food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes provided the eligibility to receive these benefits is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based upon disability or blindness criteria which are at least as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent as those under title XVI of the SSA. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended paragraph (11) of the definition of ``Elderly or disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
member'' in 7 CFR 271.2 in the interim rulemaking to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received several comments suggesting changes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule language. One commenter stated that it was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unclear in the rule language that receipt of interim assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is involved in only the first of the three new categories of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled member. The Department shares the commenter's concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is amending paragraph (11) of the definition of ``Elderly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled member'' in 7 CFR 271.2 in this rulemaking to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly indicate that receipt of interim assistance as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of being defined as disabled for food stamp purposes is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only required for those persons who are interim recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that it is unclear in the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language if it is only disability-based State general assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(GA) that must be based upon disability or blindness criteria at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least as stringent as title XVI of the SSA, or whether the ``at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least as stringent'' requirement applies to all three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. The Department interprets the law to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``at least as stringent'' criteria apply to all three types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits. The regulatory language at 7 CFR 271.2 is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended to clarify this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter pointed out that the definition of elderly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled persons in 7 CFR 271.2 needs to be revised to clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that it is State programs, not individual cases, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be measured by the ``at least as stringent criteria as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title XVI of the Social Security Act'' requirement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter argued that the regulation, as it is written in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule, appears to state that the decision as to whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GA program is based on criteria as stringent as those under title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
XVI of the Social Security Act can be made on a case-by-case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. The commenter argued, however, that the intent of Public Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100&hyph;435 was for this decision to be made on a State-by-State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, not case-by-case. The Department agrees with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter and is amending paragraph (11) of the definition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarify this point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to further emphasize that State disability programs will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be measured by criteria at least as stringent as those under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title XVI, the Department has decided to further amend the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``Elderly or disabled member'' in this final rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include in paragraph (11) of the definition the specific citation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the SSA regulations interpreting title XVI of the SSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Including this citation will provide State and local agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the information necessary to determine if an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for food stamps meets the definition of elderly/disabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person as set forth in the Food Stamp Act.

Training_7 CFR 272.4(d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 322(a) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 amended section 11(e)(6)(C) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(6)(C)) to specifically require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training for case workers provided by the State agency convey the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals of and methods for promptly and accurately certifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible households. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
272.4(d)(1)(i) to reflect this statutory language. A commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not think it was necessary for the Department to instruct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies to include this ``function'' of the Program in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training programs. As the Department explained in the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the interim rule, this language was added to the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to emphasize Congressional concern in this area as reflected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;435. The Department is adopting the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(1)(i) as final without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, pursuant to section 322(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule added a new paragraph (d)(2) to 7 CFR 272.4 to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies, at their option, to offer training and assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to persons working with certain volunteer or nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations. In conjunction with this new option, the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule added a new paragraph (f) to 7 CFR 277.4 to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses (e.g., travel costs, lodging, or meals) of the persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working with the volunteer or nonprofit organization who receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this training and assistance would not be reimbursed. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter was concerned that the interim rule language appearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 7 CFR 277.4(f) could be misinterpreted to mean that travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses of State employees who work with organizations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive this training would not be allowable. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agrees that the language could create this misinterpretation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this final rule amends the interim provisions at 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 277.4(f) to clarify this distinction. The interim provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(2) is adopted as final without change.

Information for Low-Income Households_7 CFR 272.5(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 204(a) and (b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and 7 CFR 272.5(c) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule allow State agencies, at their option, to inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households about the availability, eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, application procedures and benefits of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Program. Pursuant to section 204(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule also amended 7 CFR 272.5(c) to specify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies, at their option, may request reimbursement under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR part 277 for these outreach activities. The interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained a number of conforming amendments necessitated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition of these outreach activity provisions. 7 CFR 272.5(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was amended to specify that if a State agency elects to request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement for Program informational materials directed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-income households, those materials must meet any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilingual requirements. 7 CFR 272.5(c) was further amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that prior to claiming such outreach costs, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must receive approval from the Food and Nutrition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service (FNS) of an appropriate amendment to their State Plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations. In addition, 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) was amended to add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the optional ``Program informational activities plan'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a component of the State Plan of Operation, and 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
272.2(d)(1) was amended to add the requirement that State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies submit the optional ``Program informational activity'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning document to FNS for inclusion in their State Plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation. Lastly, the interim rule added a conforming amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 7 CFR part 277, appendix A, to remove paragraph C(14) which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made obsolete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt the requirement of 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates that State agencies submit a Program informational

activities plan is burdensome. The commenter suggested that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budget justification contained on the form FNS&hyph;366A should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to obtain the prediction of expenditures. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department disagrees. As State agencies begin to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outreach under Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department wishes to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sure that controls are in place that ensure cost-effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spending. The plans provide important information on the kinds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of activities and services being planned as well as the sub-populations at which State agencies are targeting their
efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having this information and the budget projection data will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the Department to assist State agencies in developing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most cost-effective outreach programs possible. Therefore, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule adopts the interim provisions pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for low income households as final without change.

Waiver of the In-Office Interview_7 CFR 273.2(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 330 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(e) to explicitly specify
the circumstances under which the in-office interview for an applicant household must be waived. Consequently,
current rules at 7 CFR 273.2(e) require that in-office interviews be waived if requested by households which are unable
to send a household member to the food stamp office because they: (1) Are elderly or disabled as defined in 7 CFR 271.2;
(2) live in a location which is not served by a certification office; (3) are experiencing transportation difficulties
as determined by the State agency on a case-by-case basis; or (4) are experiencing other hardships that the State agency
determines warrants a waiver of the in-office interview such as illness, care of a household member, hardships due
to residing in a rural area, prolonged severe weather or work hours. If the in-office interview is waived, the State
agency has the option to conduct a telephone interview or a home visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received one comment criticizing the interim rule provision, stating that the provision made ``the
obvious and thoroughly unnecessary statement that granting waivers to in-office interviews applied in rural areas''.
The commenter felt that adding emphasis to the regulations is not a decisive way to act when the Program has operational
problems. Furthermore, the commenter felt that problems State agencies may have in applying the requirement to grant
waivers of in-office interviews should be dealt with by FNS regional office staff. The Department understands the
commenter's concerns, but the language in the interim rule was not added to address operational concerns, but rather
was required by law. Public Law 100&hyph;435 clearly states that waiving in-office interviews for households in
rural areas is sometimes necessary, and State agencies must do so when a household meets specific criteria. The interim
rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(e) specifically to address Congressional concern that residency in a rural area not be a barrier
to participation in the Food Stamp Program. Therefore this action adopts the interim provisions at 7 CFR 273.2(e)
as final without change.

The Food Stamp Application Form_7 CFR 273.2(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended several provisions of the
regulations pertaining to the food stamp application form. Prior to publication of the interim rule, the regulations
at 7 CFR 273.2(b) permitted State agencies to deviate from the FNS-designed food stamp application in order to process
joint applications with other assistance programs, meet the requirements of a State agency computer system or accommodate
State agency needs that are determined to be justifiable. The first provision of section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435
amended section 11(e)(2) of the Food Stamp Act to mandate that, in addition to its current criteria for approving State
agency application forms, FNS must also ensure that the application is brief. Accordingly, the June 7, 1989 interim
rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b) to include brevity as a condition for approving deviations from the FNS food stamp application
form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of comments received about the food stamp application form concerned this provision. Commenters, while
supporting the interim rule's intent to shorten the food stamp application, wondered how the Department intends
to judge whether an application form is ``brief'' enough to meet the requirements of Public Law 100&hyph;435. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397 (p. 24) expressed Congressional dismay over the length of multi-program application
forms, i.e. application forms for food stamps and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits. The Department
concurs with Congress on this issue. The purpose of an application form is to obtain basic eligibility information
from the client (such as name, address, income, expenses, etc.). Such information requires only a few pages of questions
for applicant households to complete. The Department also understands, however, that limiting the length of applications
can be a problem for State agencies trying to administer a variety of programs. In December 1990, the Department completed
a review of all State-designed application forms. The review had been initiated because of the passage of Public Law
100&hyph;435 and the ongoing concern that the food stamp application not be a barrier to participation in the Program.
The reviewers found length to be the most disturbing problem with State-designed multi-program application forms.
The length of the forms ranged from 3 to 44 pages, and the number of programs covered by the forms ranged from 3 to 9. Of
the multi-program applications reviewed, 8 forms were 1&hyph;10 pages long, 21 were 11&hyph;20 pages, 7 were 21&hyph;30
pages, and 12 forms were over 30 pages long. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department realizes that the length of application forms is due to a great extent to such demands as automation
and the need to administer a variety of programs. The Food Stamp Act, however, requires the Department to ensure that
application forms are easy to use, readable, brief and written in simple terms. Therefore, the Department, in reviewing
State agency applications, attempts to balance the need to reduce the burden on applicants and each State agency's
need to administer the many programs under its jurisdiction. The Department is making no changes to the interim provision
and is adopting that provision as final.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second provision of section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 requires that the Department, in consultation with
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), provide guidance to those State agencies requesting assistance
in the development of brief, simply-written application forms, including forms that allow for simultaneous application
to participate in the Food Stamp, AFDC, and Medicaid Programs. Accordingly, the June 7, 1989 interim rule amended
7 CFR 273.2(b) to advise State agencies of their option to request assistance from FNS when developing their applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the Department reevaluate the FNS application form and work with the Department of Health
and Human Services (HHS) to design a simpler, shorter form to be used for all assistance programs. The Department has
completed drafting a revised version of the FNS Food Stamp Application Form (FNS Form 385), which is available to State
agencies. The Department believes, however, that since many public assistance programs are administered by State
agencies and funded by a combination of Federal and State monies, State agencies are better able to design a short,
multi-program application form that will enhance the administration of their public assistance programs while
lessening barriers to participation for food stamp applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter objected that there is no clear procedure to request assistance from FNS in developing a new application
form. The Department disagrees. In the preamble to the June 7, 1989 interim rule (54 FR 24521), the Department describes
the procedure necessary to request assistance. The procedure, which has not changed, is for State agencies to request
assistance through the Deputy Administrator for the Food Stamp Program. The Deputy administrator, or the Deputy
Administrator's designee, would be responsible for overseeing the review of an application form by FNS officials
at the Regional level and would coordinate the review of the application with HHS. Regional officials will be responsible
for coordinating between the State agency and the National office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 also requires that all applications for food stamp benefits contain certain
statements on the front cover which advise the household of important information about the application process.
These required statements include: (1) A place on the front cover where applicants can write their names, addresses,
and signatures; (2) instructions that advise the households of their right to file the application without finishing
all parts; (3) a statement describing the expedited service procedures; and (4) a statement that informs the household
that benefits are provided only from the date of application. Accordingly, the interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)
to require that the food stamp application form contain the above information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to publication of the interim rule, section 1736 of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief
Act, Title XVII, Public Law 101&hyph;624, 104 Stat. 3359, enacted November 28, 1990 (hereafter referred to as the
Leland Act) amended section 11(e) of the Food Stamp Act to require that certain information previously mandated to
be displayed on the front cover of the application form must now be placed ``on or near'' the front page of the application
form. There must continue to appear on the front page of the application a place where applicants can write their names,
addresses, and signatures. However, the instructions that advise the households of their right to file the application
without finishing all parts, the statement describing the expedited service procedures, and the statement that
informs the household that benefits are provided only from the date of application must now appear ``on or near'' the
front page. The Department implemented this provision in a final regulation implementing categorical eligibility
and application provisions of the Leland Act, published at 56 FR 63611 on December 4, 1991, which amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(v),
(b)(1)(vi), and (b)(1)(vii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes mandated by the Leland Act and implemented in the final rule published on December 4, 1991 have superseded
the provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435 pertaining to mandatory information appearing on the front page of the
application form. For this reason, the Department is not addressing any comments which discuss this provision of
Public Law 100&hyph;435. Individuals with any questions about this provision should refer to the December 4, 1991
final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 310 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule mandate that households be informed on the application
of their right to file for food stamp benefits with only their name, address and signature. This is reflected in 7 CFR
273.2(b)(1)(iv) of the interim rule. A commenter felt this requirement did not consider the impact on on-line application
systems which satisfy the intent of this provision in a more sophisticated manner. Usually, an on-line application
system does not require applicants to complete any handwritten information on an application form. The eligibility
worker completes the on-line application at the certification interview. When an applicant is unable to complete
the on-line application process, usually some sort of ``Intent to Apply'' application form is submitted to protect
the filing date. The applicant then returns to complete the on-line application process at a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not believe the interim rule conflicts with any on-line system presently in operation. In the
final rulemaking implementing categorical eligibility and application provisions of the Leland Act, published
at 56 FR 63611 on December 4, 1991, the Department amended 7 CFR 273.2(b)(3) to give FNS authority to review and approve
deviations from the FNS-designed application form, including the use of on-line application forms. The Department
believes this oversight authority will ensure that on-line application forms contain the mandatory information
required by law. The Department is therefore adopting the interim provision in 7 CFR 273.2(b)(1)(iv) as final without
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also received a general comment which recommended the final rule specifically indicate when the term
``applications'' refers to the applicant's initial request for certification only, and when it refers to recertification.
For food stamp purposes, the Department does not differentiate between certification and recertification. In both
situations, a household must complete and submit a food stamp application form, provide verification of information
and participate in an interview with an eligibility worker. Therefore, the term ``applications'' in the interim
rule and in this final rule refers to both initial certification and subsequent recertifications. The Department
is, however, considering differentiating between initial certification and subsequent recertification. The
Department is currently developing a proposed rule to consider means to simplify program requirements, including
simplifying recertification procedures. In that rule, the Department may propose introducing differences in processing
initial applications for certification and applications for recertification.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 352 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 reinstated joint application practices that were previously required under
the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as originally enacted, but subsequently were made optional by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97&hyph;253, 96 Stat. 763, Sept. 8, 1982). Accordingly, the interim rule, published June 7, 1989,
amended 7 CFR 273.2 (j) and (j)(1)(i) to require State agencies to join the application for food stamps with the application
for public assistance (PA) and general assistance (GA) and to notify AFDC applicants of their right to file a joint
application. The interim rule also amended 7 CFR 273.2(j)(1) to add a new paragraph (j)(1)(v) which specified that
households whose PA/GA eligibility was terminated shall not be required to file a new application, but shall have
their food stamp eligibility and benefits determined by available information from the PA/GA casefile provided
the information is sufficient for food stamp purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the mandate for joint processing of applications were nearly evenly split between opponents and proponents.
One commenter recommended the final rule mandate development of a single, universal application for all needs-based
assistance programs. Another commenter focused on the issue of whether the interim rule exceeded the legislative
intent of section 352 by requiring a single ``application'' for both food stamps and AFDC when only a single ``interview''
is necessary. The commenter felt the interim rule should be amended to mandate only a joint interview for food stamp/AFDC
applicants, not a joint application. Another commenter disagreed with the requirement to include the application
for food stamps in the application for GA benefits because GA is a State-run program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the first comment recommending the development of a single, universal application, the Department has
found that many State agencies have already developed ``multi-program'' forms, i.e., one form is used for food stamps,
PA and GA, and medical assistance. The Department feels State agencies are in a better position to design application
forms that enhance the administration of their benefit assistance programs. For this reason, the Department believes
mandating a single, universal application form is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department disagrees with the premise of the second comment, which stated that the interim rule exceeded legislative
intent by mandating a joint application for both food stamps and AFDC rather than just a joint interview. Section 11(i)
of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(i)), as amended by section 352 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, requires that households
in which all members are included in a federally aided public assistance grant (such as AFDC) have their application
for food stamps contained in the public assistance application form. The Department believes the law is clear in requiring
a joint application for food stamps and PA (as used here, PA is defined at 7 CFR 271.2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to the third comment, legislation passed subsequent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 100&hyph;435 further defined the requirements regarding joint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications for GA and food stamps. Section 1740 of the Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act modified the combined application form requirement in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11(i)(3) of the Food Stamp Act to require a combined GA and food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stamp application form only in States that have a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statewide GA application form. The Department implemented this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in the December 4, 1991, final rule (56 FR 63597) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented the categorical eligibility and application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Leland Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth commenter recommended that the Department withhold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of joint applications which require clients to answer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions irrelevant to the Food Stamp Program if they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying for food stamps only. The commenter felt that clients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be informed that answers to those questions are optional. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that any joint application must be clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to afford applicants the option of answering only those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions relevant to the program or programs for which they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying. The Department is amending the regulatory language at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 311 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 7, 1989, implemented five provisions pertaining to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification of application information supplied by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household. The interim provisions required that State agencies: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide all applicant households with a clear written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement explaining what the household must do to cooperate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining verification and completing the application; (2) assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each applicant household in obtaining verification and completing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application process; (3) not require households to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple sources of verification when the household has already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided verification which adequately supports statements on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application (although a State agency may require households to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide additional verification when the State agency determines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that existing verification is incomplete, inaccurate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent); (4) not deny an application solely because a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person outside of the household (who is not a person outside of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household because of a specific disqualification action or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ineligible status) fails to cooperate with the State agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of the application; and (5) process applications, if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household cooperates by providing information, by taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate steps to verify information otherwise required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verified under the Food Stamp Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt that clarification is needed regarding whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State agency must provide applicants with a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification statement or a specific verification statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tailored to each applicant household (7 CFR 273.2(c)(5)). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes the preamble to the interim rule was quite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear in encouraging State agencies to develop a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that could be given to all applicant households, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than a written statement which would need to be tailored to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant household. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the interim rule provided guidelines that must be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the general verification notice, the Department wishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promote greater conformity among State agency-designed notices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that applicant households are consistently informed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the necessary documents needed for verification of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(c)(5) to add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that the State agency, at a minimum, include in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general verification notice examples of the types of documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household should provide and an explanation of the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the documents should cover.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter correctly pointed out that the preamble of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule was incorrect in stating that current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that social security numbers must be verified prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying any applicant household for benefits. Current rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;273.2(f)(1)(v) state that the State agency shall not delay the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification for or issuance of benefits to an otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible household solely to verify the social security number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SSN) of a household member. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter correctly identified an inconsistency in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim regulation language at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(i)(A) with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to the requirement for verification where the source of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household's income has changed. The first sentence of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section correctly states that ``the State agency shall verify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in income or actual expenses if the source has changed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount has changed by more than $25.'' The final sentence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertently omits the requirement for verification anytime the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of income changes, even if the amount has changed by $25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or less. The same inconsistency exists at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(i)(A) and (ii) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct the inconsistencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter criticized the interim rule's interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 311(D) of Public Law 100&hyph;435. Section 311(D) provides that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State agency may not deny any application for participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely because of the failure of a person outside of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household to cooperate with a request for providing verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision would not apply when the person refusing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperate would otherwise be a household member but for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of any of the individual disqualification provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsections (b), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of section 6 of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Act. These subsections require disqualification for any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person intentionally making a false or misleading statement or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committing any act which violates the Food Stamp Act (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(b)); any non-exempt person who is physically and mentally fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is between the ages of 16 and 60 who refuses to register to

work (section 6(d)); any person who is a student enrolled at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least half-time in an institution of higher education (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6(e)); any person who is not a resident of the United States, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not either a citizen or a lawful alien (section 6(f)); and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual who receives SSI benefits in a ``cash-out'' State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(section 6(g)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When amending 7 CFR 273.2(d)(1) to incorporate the mandate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 311(D) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department added two more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories to the list of persons outside the household who cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial of an application for participation if they fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperate with a request for providing verification. These two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new categories were: Individuals disqualified for failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an SSN, and persons who fail to attest to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
citizenship or alien status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter who criticized this provision felt that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department had exceeded its authority in excluding two new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories of non-household members from the third-party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters correctly point out that the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broadened the third party verification rule to include two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional categories of persons who will cause the denial of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to participate if they failed to cooperate with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request to provide verification. This was done to make this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision consistent with other provisions in the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where ineligible or disqualified persons are, in effect, deemed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by program regulations to be a household member for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining eligibility and benefit levels. FNS believes this is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate as it is consistent with the desire to simplify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements that was expressed by Congress in adopting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Hunger Prevention Act (See, e.g., Senate Report No. 100&hyph;397, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p.25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule also amended verification standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households subject to monthly reporting and retrospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting (MRRB) at 7 CFR 273.21(i) (1) and (3). Those provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not being finalized in this final rule, however, because they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been superseded by amendments made in the final rule on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monthly Reporting and Retrospective Budgeting Amendments and Mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes, published on December 4, 1991, at 56 FR 63597. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals with questions about verification standards for MRRB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households should refer to this December 4, 1991 final rule.

Demonstration Projects/Cash-Outs in Other Benefit Programs_7

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 340 of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule amended 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to specify that in-kind or vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments which would normally be excluded as income but are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converted in whole, or in part, to a direct cash payment under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approval of a federally authorized demonstration project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall continue to be excluded from income. These federally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized demonstration projects include demonstration projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
created by waiver of the provisions of Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, conversion to direct cash payment does not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-deductibility of the expenses paid with these funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, in order to ensure that an excluded vendor payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which has been converted to a direct cash payment is not excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twice (once as income and once as expenses) the interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to specify that an expense covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an excluded vendor payment which has been converted to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct cash payment under the approval of a federally authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstration project remains non-deductible as a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received no comments regarding these provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule. Therefore, this action adopts the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions as final with no changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 323 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and the interim rule, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies are required to provide a household, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification and recertification, with a statement describing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the household's reporting responsibilities. Moreover, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies must provide all households with a toll-free telephone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number or a number where collect calls will be accepted in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the household to reach an appropriate representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency. The interim rule amended 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically require that the ``change report'' form include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement describing the household's reporting responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 7 CFR 273.12(b)(1) was amended to specify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``change report'' form must contain the number of the food stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
office and a toll-free number or a number where collect calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be accepted. (Reporting requirements remained unchanged for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households subject to MRRB provisions of 7 CFR 273.21.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule also amended the provisions relative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Eligibility, the Notice of Denial, the Notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adverse Action, and the requirements for bilingual notices. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 7 CFR 272.4(b)(3)(ii)(B), 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.10(g)(1)(i)(A), 7 CFR 273.10(g)(1)(ii) and 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.13(a)(2), respectively, were amended to specify that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices must also include either a toll-free number or a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where collect calls will be accepted for households living 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside the local calling area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received one comment on these provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule. The commenter pointed out that the legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent of the toll-free or collect telephone number was to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase households' access to the State agency in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain information or report changes. The commenter felt this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of purpose should be incorporated into the rule itself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to help guide State agencies' implementation efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes including a statement of purpose in 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.12(b) is unnecessary. Congress was clear that its intent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passing the Hunger Prevention Act was to make it easier for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible households to apply and obtain benefits (Senate Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 100&hyph;397, p.25). On its face, the implementation of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision demonstrates its purpose without additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explanation. The interim provisions are adopted as final without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to two provisions of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Program regulations to extend eligibility to farm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households which are in need of program assistance. Section 341 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Public Law 100&hyph;435 specified that self-employed farm households 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are subject to MRRB have the option to annualize their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-employment income and expenses over a 12-month period. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision was implemented in the interim rule by amending 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
273.21(f)(2)(i) and 273.11.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 342 of Public Law 100&hyph;435 affected farm households which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quit farming. Accordingly, 7 CFR 273.8(e)(5) was amended by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule to specify that property essential to self- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment of a household member engaged in farming is excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a resource for one year from the date the household member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates self-employment from farming. A conforming amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1)(i) specified that any licensed vehicle which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been used over 50 percent of the time in the self-employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a household member engaged in farming continues to be excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a resource for one year from the date the household member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates his/her self-employment from farming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received only one comment on the interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which supported the one-year extension of the above exclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this action adopts the interim provisions as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without change.

Under the interim rule, the provisions addressed in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule were retroactively implemented effective July 1, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received several comments complaining about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short implementation time for the interim rule. While we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sympathize about the short lead time given to State agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement the interim rule, the Department had no discretion in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this matter and had to implement the time frames mandated by Public Law 100&hyph;435. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this final action which adopt as final without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change provisions of the interim rule or modify a provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim rule for clarity only are retroactively effective to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1, 1989. The clarifications do not represent any change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy and, thus, do not require any special implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts by State agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of this final action which require the alteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of State procedures, are to be effective May 6, 1994. State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must complete implementation efforts of new provisions no later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than September 5, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any variance resulting from the implementation of the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment shall be excluded from quality control error

The provisions of this final rule

that amend 7 CFR 273.2(b)(3), 273.2(c)(5), 273.2(f)(8) (i)(A) and

(ii), and paragraph (11) of the ``Elderly or disabled member'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition in 7 CFR 271.2 are effective as of May 6, 1994. The State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall implement the provisions not later than September 5, 1994 for all households newly applying for Program benefits
on or after such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation date. The current caseload shall be converted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these provisions at household request, at the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recertification, or when the case is next reviewed, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs first, and the State agency must provide restored benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
back to the required implementation date. If for any reason a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency fails to implement on the required implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date, restored benefits shall be provided, if appropriate, back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the required implementation date or the date of application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is later. Any variances resulting from implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the provisions of this amendment shall be excluded from error

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Board) has revised and reissued its Rules Regarding Equal
Opportunity (Rules) to conform those Rules as closely as possible to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's

Opportunity'', which became effective October 1, 1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These Rules are hereby issued as a final rule. The Board issued these Rules as an interim rule, with request for public
comments, on February 18, 1993. This final rule deviates from the interim rule in only a few particulars, based upon
recommendations received from the Commission and from interested members of the Board's staff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to laws respecting discrimination in employment, the Board as a matter of policy has long recognized that
it should afford to its employees, applicants for employment, and others the same substantive and procedural rights
that are enjoyed by persons in their dealings with other government agencies. Pursuant to this policy, part 268 has
been revised by the Board after the issuance by the Commission of its federal sector complaint processing regulations
(29 CFR part 1614) which became effective on October 1, 1992. A new part 268 was issued by the Board as an interim rule
effective February 18, 1993; (58 FR 9517, February 22, 1993) and is now issued as a final rule with revisions following
receipt and consideration of public comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the Commission's new regulations, this final rule addresses matters of the kind addressed by Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 791), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended (29 U.S.C.
621 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) and the Equal Pay Act (29 U.S.C. 206(d)). Subpart G (Prohibition Against Discrimination In Board Programs And Activities
Because Of A Physical Or Mental Handicap) of the interim rule has also been revised consistent with recent revisions
to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission and one commenter recommended that the terms ``handicap'' and ``handicapped'' should be replaced
with ``disability'' or ``disabled'' throughout the Rules. The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 substituted
the term ``disability'' for the term ``handicap'' throughout the Rehabilitation Act (Section 102(f), Pub. L. 102&hyph;569).
It is the Board's intention to update the language of its Rules to conform to the 1992 amendment with whatever updates
are made by the Commission. Although such revisions have not yet been incorporated in the Commission's regulations
(29 CFR part 1614), in light of the Commission's specific recommendations, the Board has substituted appropriate
language throughout the Rules as set forth above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter took exception to the deletion of section 703 (Self evaluation) of the prior Rules, which was in effect
prior to February 18, 1993. Section 703 had required the Board to evaluate its then current policies and practices,
and to make necessary modifications, regarding the upgrade of its facilities to conform to the standards of Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The time limits stated in section 703 have passed. The Board has conducted the required
survey of its facilities, and the Board has been implementing appropriate modifications to its facilities. Therefore,
the Board believes that section 703 has become moot. The Board believes that this is a technical deletion that does
not affect the Board's strong and continuing commitment to equal opportunity and equal access for individuals with
a disability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission suggested merging &sect;268.102(u) into &sect;268.102(t) of the Rules, so that both paragraphs
relate to sections 501 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Board has adopted this suggestion. The Commission also
suggested that the Board amend the definition of ``individual with a disability'' to exclude from the definition
alcoholics and individuals with current infectious diseases. With the assistance of the Commission's staff, the
Board has inserted language in &sect;268.303 which provides that alcoholics will be held to the same performance
and conduct standards that all other Board employees must satisfy, following the Commission's regulations regarding
holding alcoholics to the same performance and conduct standards to which an employer holds its other employees.
29 CFR 1630.16(b). In addition, language has been inserted to prevent persons with infectious diseases from working
in the Board's food handling area, following the Commission's regulations regarding infectious and communicable
diseases for food handling jobs. 29 CFR 1630.16(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission suggested that adoption of part 268 by the Board is unnecessary in light of the Commission's Government-wide
complaint processing procedures. 29 CFR part 1614. The Board believes, however, based on specific provisions of
the Federal Reserve Act and established precedent, that adoption of part 268 is necessary to authorize and insure
the Board's compliance with the important national policies set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and
the other laws cited above. The Board will continue to work closely with the Commission to insure effective implementation
of these Rules consistent with those laws and the policies of the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one commenter expressed a concern regarding the organizational placement and reporting relationship
of the EEO Programs Officer. Citing the Commission's Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity regulations (29
CFR 1614.102(b)(3)), the commenter proposed that the EEO Programs Officer report to the Chairman of the Board of Governors.
The Commission addressed this matter in the preamble to its regulations and stated ``Moreover, &sect;1614.607 permits
[the agency head] to delegate that authority. Ultimate responsibility would remain, though, with the higher official.''
57 FR 12642, April 10, 1992. The Board believes that the EEO Programs Officer's reporting relationship is appropriate
and is consistent with the Commission's approach. In this connection, the Board's Rule provides that the EEO Programs

Other Revisions to Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional, minor modifications have been made in the final rule based on comments received from Board staff. These
modifications are not substantive: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The third sentence in &sect;268.103(c)(11) has been re-written to reflect actual practice concerning the EEO
Programs Director's contracting authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A new paragraph (d) has been added to &sect;268.202 stating that section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act is covered
by these Rules, which caused paragraphs (d) and (e) to be renumbered as paragraphs (e) and (f); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sections 268.202(e)(13), 268.205(c), 268.204(b) and 268.604(b) were modified to clarify existing language
in the interim rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 268.204(f) was modified to make it clear that the Board will develop and use alternative dispute resolution
procedures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 268.206(a)(7) was modified to provide that the Staff Director for Management or the General Counsel,
or their designees, should consult with the EEO Programs Director before issuing the certification as provided for
in subparagraph (7); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Because of the strict time limits governing the issuance of a final decision, &sect;&sect;268.209(a) and 268.709(k)
have been modified to provide that the Governors will have only 3 business days (formerly 7 calendar days) to ask that
a matter be brought to the full Board for final decision rather than be resolved by the Board's delegee; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Section 268.304(b)(3) was modified so that it now provides that the Board will prefer only U.S. citizens over equally
qualified noncitizens in hiring. This was done to insure compliance with the Immigration Reform and Control Act,
as amended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules are hereby issued as the Board's final rule and this final rule shall be made effective 30 days from publication.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Aggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex,
national origin, age or disability must consult an EEO Counselor prior to filing a complaint in order to try to informally
resolve the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) An aggrieved person must initiate contact with an EEO Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged
to be discriminatory or, in the case of a personnel action, within 45 days of the date that the action was communicated
to the aggrieved person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board shall extend the 45-day time limit in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when the individual shows that
he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them, that he or she did not know and reasonably
should not have known that the discriminatory matter or personnel action occurred, that despite due diligence he
or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from contacting an EEO Counselor within the time limits,
or for other reasons considered sufficient by the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) At the initial counseling session, EEO Counselors must advise individuals in writing of their rights and responsibilities,
including the right to request a hearing after the investigation by the Board, the right to file a notice of intent to
sue pursuant to &sect;268.301(a) of this part and to file a lawsuit alleging a violation of the ADEA instead of an administrative
complaint of age discrimination under this part, the duty to mitigate damages, administrative and court time frames,
and that only the matter(s) raised in pre-complaint counseling (or issues like or related to issues raised in pre-complaint
counseling) may be alleged in a subsequent complaint filed with the Board. EEO Counselors must advise individuals
of their duty to keep the Board informed of their current address, to serve copies of requests for review by the Commission
on the Board, and to keep the Commission informed of their current address in connection with any review of a Board action.
The notice required by paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall include a notice of the right to file a class complaint.
If the aggrieved person informs an EEO Counselor that he or she wishes to file a class complaint, the EEO Counselor shall
explain the class complaint procedures and the responsibilities of the agent of the class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) EEO Counselors shall conduct counseling activities in accordance with instructions promulgated by the EEO Programs
Director, which shall be consistent with the counseling guidelines contained in the Commission's ``EEO Management
Directives For 29 CFR part 1614''. When advised that a complaint has been filed by an aggrieved person, the EEO Counselor
shall submit a written report within 15 calendar days to the EEO Programs Director and to the aggrieved person concerning

(d) Unless the aggrieved person agrees to a longer counseling period under paragraph (e) of this section, the EEO Counselor
shall conduct the final interview with the aggrieved person within 30 days of the date the aggrieved person brought
the matter to the EEO Counselor's attention. If the matter has not been resolved, the aggrieved person shall be informed
in writing by the EEO Counselor, not later than the 30th day after contacting the EEO Counselor, of the right to file
a discrimination complaint with the Board. This notice shall inform the complainant of the right to file a discrimination
complaint within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, of the appropriate official with whom to file a complaint
and of the complainant's duty to assure that the EEO Programs Director is informed immediately if the complainant
retains counsel or a representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Prior to the end of the 30-day period, the aggrieved person may agree in writing with the Board to postpone the final
interview and extend the counseling period for an additional period of no more than 60 days. If the matter has not been
resolved before the conclusion of the agreed extension, the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section shall
be issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In the event the aggrieved person believes that he/she has been discriminated against and agrees to participate
in an established Board alternative dispute resolution procedure, the pre-complaint processing period of this
section will be 90 days. If the matter has not been resolved before the 90th day, the notice described in paragraph (d)
of this section shall then be issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The EEO Counselor shall not attempt in any way to restrain the aggrieved person from filing a complaint. The EEO
Counselor shall not reveal the identity of an aggrieved person who consulted the EEO Counselor, except when authorized

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The complainant has the right to file a request for review with the Commission with regard to the Board's final decision
or dismissal of all or a portion of a complaint; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board is required to conduct a complete and fair investigation of the complaint within 180 days of the filing
of the complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Board shall dismiss a complaint or a portion of a complaint: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That fails to state a claim under &sect;&sect;268.203 and 268.205(c) of this part, or states the same claim that
is pending before or has been decided by the Board or the Commission; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That fails to comply with the applicable time limits contained in &sect;&sect;268.204, 268.205(b) and 268.305(b)
of this part, unless the Board extends the time limits in accordance with &sect;268.604(c) of this part, or that raises
a matter that has not been brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor and is not like or related to a matter that has been
brought to the attention of an EEO Counselor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That is the basis of a pending civil action in a United States District Court in which the complainant is a party,
provided that at least 180 days have passed since the filing of the administrative complaint, or that was the basis
of a civil action decided by a United States District Court in which the complainant was a party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That is moot or alleges that a proposal to take a personnel action, or other preliminary step to taking a personnel
action, is discriminatory; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Where the complainant cannot be located, provided that reasonable efforts have been made to locate the complainant
and the complainant has not responded within 15 calendar days to a notice of proposed dismissal sent to his or her last
known address; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Where the Board has provided the complainant with a written request to provide relevant information or otherwise
proceed with the complaint, and the complainant has failed to respond to the request within 15 calendar days of its
receipt or the complainant's response does not address the Board's request, provided that the request included a
notice of the proposed dismissal. Instead of dismissing for failure to cooperate, the complaint may be adjudicated
if sufficient information for that purpose is available; or

the Board's Staff Director for Management, the General Counsel or a designee reporting directly to the Staff Director
for Management or General Counsel (after consulting with the EEO Programs Director) that the offer constitutes full
relief, provided that the offer gave notice that failure to accept would result in dismissal of the complaint. An offer
of full relief under this paragraph (a)(7) is the appropriate relief in &sect;268.501 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Board shall inform the complainant of the right to file a request for review with the Commission with regard
to the dismissal of the individual complaint pursuant to &sect;268.401 of this part, or to file a civil action. A copy
of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision to dismiss an individual complaint

Investigation of complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The investigation of individual complaints shall be conducted by an investigator appointed by the EEO Programs
Director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Consistent with guidance proffered by the Commission, the Board, through the EEO Programs Director, shall develop
a complete and impartial factual record upon which to make findings on the matters raised by the written complaint.
The investigator may use an exchange of letters or memoranda, interrogatories, investigations, fact-finding conferences
or any other fact-finding methods that efficiently and thoroughly address the matters at issue. The EEO Programs
Director may incorporate alterative dispute resolution techniques into the investigation in order to promote early
resolution of complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section apply to the investigation of complaints: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The complainant, the Board and any employee of the Board shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence
as the investigator deems necessary, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies of the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The investigator may administer oaths. Statements of witnesses shall be made under oath or affirmation or, alteratively,
by written statement under penalty of perjury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the complainant, or the Board or its employees, fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely
fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits or the attendance of witness(es),
the investigator may note in the investigative record that the Board when rendering a final decision should, or the
Commission on review may, in appropriate circumstances:

(i) Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have
reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the
opposing party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If documentary or testimonial evidence is needed by the investigator, and such documentary evidence is known
to be contained in the files of another federal agency, or the testimony of an employee of another federal agency is
needed, the EEO Programs Director shall, if necessary, contact the Commission for assistance in obtaining such documentary
or testimonial evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The investigation shall be conducted by an investigator with appropriate security clearances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Board shall complete its investigation within 180 days of the date of the filing of an individual complaint
or within the time period contained in the determination of the Commission on review of a dismissal pursuant to &sect;268.206
of this part. By written agreement within those time periods, the complainant and the Board may voluntarily extend
the time period for not more than an additional 90 days. The Board may unilaterally extend the time period or any period
of extension for not more than 30 days where it must sanitize a complaint file that may contain confidential information
of the Board under 12 CFR part 261, or other privileged information of the Board, provided the Board notifies the complainant
of the extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Within 180 days from the filing of the complaint, within the time period contained in a determination of the Commission's
Office of Federal Operations on review of a dismissal, or within any period of extension provided for in paragraph
(e) of this section, the Board shall notify the complainant that the investigation has been completed, shall provide
the complainant with a copy of the investigative file, and shall notify the complainant that, within 30 days of the
receipt of the investigative file, the complainant has the right to request a hearing before an administrative judge
from the Commission or may receive an immediate final decision pursuant to &sect;268.209 of this part from the Board.
In the absence of the required notice, the complainant may request a hearing under &sect;268.208 of this part at any
time after 180 days has elapsed from the filing of the complaint.

Requests
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. When a complainant requests a hearing, the EEO Programs Director shall request the Commission to appoint an administrative
judge to conduct a hearing in accordance with this section. Any hearing will be conducted by an administrative judge
or hearing examiner with appropriate security clearances. Where the administrative judge determines that the complainant
is raising or intends to pursue issues like or related to those raised in the complaint, but which the Board has not had
an opportunity to address, the administrative judge shall remand any such issue for counseling in accordance with
&sect;268.204 of this part or for such other processing as may be ordered by the administrative judge.

. The administrative judge shall notify the parties of the right to seek discovery prior to the hearing and may issue
such discovery orders as are appropriate. Unless the parties agree in writing concerning the methods and scope of
discovery, the party seeking discovery shall request authorization from the administrative judge prior to commencing
discovery. Both parties are entitled to reasonable development of evidence on matters relevant to the issues raised
in the complaint, but the administrative judge may reasonably limit the quantity and timing of discovery. Evidence
may be developed through interrogatories, depositions, and requests for admissions, stipulations or production
of documents. It shall be grounds for objection to producing evidence that the information sought by either party
is irrelevant, overburdensome, repetitious, privileged, or that production would be unlawful.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conduct of hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Board shall provide for the attendance at a hearing of all Board employees approved as witnesses by an administrative
judge. Attendance at hearings will be limited to persons determined by the administrative judge to have direct knowledge
relating to the complaint. Hearings are part of the investigative process and are thus closed to the public. The administrative
judge shall have the power to regulate the conduct of a hearing, limit the number of witnesses where testimony would
be repetitious, and exclude any person from the hearing for contumacious conduct or misbehavior that obstructs the
hearing. The administrative judge shall receive into evidence information or documents relevant to the complaint.
Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, but the administrative judge shall exclude irrelevant or repetitious
evidence. The administrative judge or the Commission may refer to the Disciplinary Committee of the appropriate
Bar Association any attorney or, upon reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard, suspend or disqualify from
representing complainants or agencies in hearings raising claims of discrimination any representative who refuses
to follow the orders of an administrative judge, or who otherwise engages in improper conduct. The Board in such circumstances
may take whatever action it deems appropriate to suspend or disqualify any such attorney or representative from appearing
or practicing before the Board.

. The procedures in paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section apply to hearings of complaints: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The complainant, the Board and any employee of the Board shall produce such documentary and testimonial evidence
as the administrative judge deems necessary, consistent with applicable laws, regulations and policies of the Board.
If documentary or testimonial evidence is needed for the hearing, and such documentary evidence is known to be contained
in the files of another federal agency, or if the testimony of an employee of another federal agency is needed, then
the administrative judge may seek assistance from appropriate sources in obtaining such documentary or testimonial
evidence for the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Administrative judges are authorized to administer oaths. Statements of witnesses shall be made under oath or
affirmation or, alternatively, by written statement under penalty of perjury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the complainant, or the Board or its employees fail without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely
fashion to requests for documents, records, comparative data, statistics, affidavits, or the attendance of witness(es),
the administrative judge may, in appropriate circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Draw an adverse inference that the requested information, or the testimony of the requested witness, would have
reflected unfavorably on the party refusing to provide the requested information; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Consider the matters to which the requested information or testimony pertains to be established in favor of the
opposing party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information or witness; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Issue a finding fully or partially in favor of the opposing party; or

Findings and conclusions without hearing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) If a party believes that some or all material facts are not in genuine dispute and there is no genuine issue as to
credibility, the party may, at least 15 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing or at such earlier time as required
by the administrative judge, file a statement with the administrative judge prior to the hearing setting forth the
fact or facts and referring to the parts of the record relied on to support the statement. The statement must demonstrate
that there is no genuine issue as to any such material fact. The party shall serve the statement on the opposing party.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The opposing party may file an opposition within 15 calendar days of receipt of the statement in paragraph (e)(1)
of this section. The opposition may refer to the record in the case to rebut the statement that a fact is not in dispute
or may file an affidavit stating that the party cannot, for reasons stated, present facts to oppose the request. After
considering the submissions, the administrative judge may order that discovery be permitted on the fact or facts
involved, limit the hearing to the issues remaining in dispute, issue findings and conclusions without a hearing
or make such other ruling as is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the administrative judge determines upon his or her own initiative that some or all facts are not in genuine dispute,
he or she may, after giving notice to the parties and providing them an opportunity to respond in writing within 15 calendar
days, issue an order limiting the scope of the hearing or issue findings and conclusions without holding a hearing.

. Unless the administrative judge makes a written determination that good cause exists for extending the time for
issuing findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 180 days of a request for a hearing being received by the Commission,
an administrative judge shall issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on the merits of the complaint, and shall
order appropriate relief where discrimination is found with regard to the matter that gave rise to the complaint.
The administrative judge shall send copies of the entire record, including the transcript, and the findings and conclusions

General policy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board shall give full consideration to the hiring, placement and advancement of qualified individuals with a
disability who are physically or mentally disabled. The Board shall be a model employer of individuals with a disability.
The Board shall not discriminate against individuals with a disability who are physically or mentally disabled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasonable accommodation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Board shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an employee or applicant
for employment who is a qualified individual with a disability unless the Board can demonstrate that the accommodation
would impose an undue hardship on its operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Making facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with a disability; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices,
appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, and other similar
actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In determining whether, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, an accommodation would impose an undue
hardship on the operation of the Board, factors to be considered include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The overall size of the Board's operations with respect to the number of employees, number and type of facilities
and size of budget; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The type of Board operation, including the composition and structure of the Board's work force; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Employment criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Board shall not make use of any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen
out qualified individuals with a disability or any class of individuals with a disability unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The test score or other selection criterion is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business
necessity; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There are no available alterative job-related tests that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many individuals
with a disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board shall select and administer tests concerning employment so as to insure that, when administered to an
employee or applicant for employment who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test
results accurately reflect the employee's or applicant's ability to perform the position or type of position in question
rather than reflecting the employee's or applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skill (except where
those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-employment inquiries. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, the Board shall not conduct a pre-employment medical
examination and shall not make pre-employment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is an individual
with a disability or as to the nature or severity of a disability. The Board may, however, make pre-employment inquiry
into an applicant's ability to meet the essential functions of the job, or the medical qualification requirements
if applicable, with or without reasonable accommodation, of the position in question, i.e., the minimum abilities
necessary for safe and efficient performance of the duties of the position in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Board from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical
examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of disability or when the pre-employment
medical questionnaire used for positions that do not routinely require medical examination indicates a condition
for which further examination is required because of the job-related nature of the condition; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the gathering of pre-employment medical information for
the purpose of hiring individuals with a disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To enable and evaluate affirmative action to hire, place or advance individuals with a disability, the Board may
invite employees and applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are disabled, if:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The Board states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written
questionnaire is used, that the information requested is intended for use solely in conjunction with affirmative
action; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Board states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that refusal to provide
it will not subject the employee or applicant for employment to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only
in accordance with this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the employee or
applicant for employment shall be kept confidential except that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Managers, selecting officials, and others involved in the selection process or responsible for affirmative
action may be informed that the employee or applicant for employment is an individual with a disability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary accommodations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

treatment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 (1) The Board shall not discriminate against employees or applicants for employment who are qualified individuals
with a disability due to the inaccessibility of its facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It shall be the policy of the Board to comply with the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act, the Architectural Barriers
Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reassignment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a nonprobationary employee becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with
reasonable accommodation due to a disability, the Board shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant
position at the same grade level, the essential functions of which the employee would be able to perform with reasonable
accommodation if necessary unless the reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the Board.
In the absence of a position at the same grade level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available
grade level below the employee's current grade level shall be made, but availability of such a vacancy shall not affect
the employee's entitlement, if any, to disability retirement pursuant to any retirement plan in which the employee
is enrolled. If the Board has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position
at the time the Board has determined that the nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions
of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the Board does not have an obligation under this section
to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the Board shall consider the individual on an equal basis
with those who applied for the position.

use of drugs, when the Board acts on the basis of such use. The term ``drug'' means a controlled substance, as defined
in Schedules I through V of Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812). The term ``illegal use of drugs''
means the use of drugs, the possession or distribution of which is unlawful under the Controlled Substances Act, but
does not include the use of a drug taken under supervision by a licensed health care professional, or other uses authorized
by the Controlled Substances Act or other provisions of federal law. This exclusion, however, does not exclude an

 The term ``individual with a disability'' does not include an employee who is an alcoholic whose current use of alcohol
prevents the employee from performing the duties of his or her job, or whose employment by reason of such current alcohol
use, would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of others. In this regard, alcoholics shall meet the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Within 30 days of the Board's receipt of a class complaint, the Board shall designate a representative who shall
monitor the class complaint on behalf of the Board and who shall be one of the individuals referenced in &sect;268.202(e)(3)
of this part, and forward the class complaint, along with a copy of the EEO Counselor's report and any other information
pertaining to timeliness or other relevant circumstances related to the class complaint, to the Commission's Office
of Federal Operations. The Commission shall assign the class complaint to an administrative judge or complaints
examiner who shall, if required, have a proper security clearance. The administrative judge may require the agent
of the class or the Board to submit additional information relevant to the complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The administrative judge may recommend that the Board dismiss the class complaint, or any portion, for any of the
reasons listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;268.206 of this part, or because it does not meet the prerequisites of a class complaint under &sect;268.102(g)
of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If an allegation of discrimination in the class complaint is not included in the EEO Counselor's report, the administrative
judge shall afford the agent of the class 15 calendar days to state whether the matter was discussed with the EEO Counselor
and, if not, explain why it was not discussed. If the explanation is not satisfactory, the administrative judge shall
recommend that the Board dismiss the allegation under &sect;268.206 of this part. If the explanation is satisfactory,
the administrative judge shall refer the allegation to the Board for further counseling by an EEO Counselor with the
agent of the class. After counseling, the allegation shall be consolidated with the class complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If an allegation of discrimination in the class complaint lacks specificity and detail, the administrative judge
shall afford the agent of the class 15 calendar days to provide specific and detailed information. The administrative
judge shall recommend that the Board dismiss the class complaint if the agent of the class fails to provide such information
within the specified time period. If the information provided contains new allegations outside the scope of the complaint,
the administrative judge shall advise the agent of the class how to proceed on an individual or class basis concerning
these allegations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The administrative judge shall recommend that the Board extend the time limits for filing a class complaint and
for consulting with an EEO Counselor in accordance with the time limit extension provisions contained in &sect;&sect;268.204(a)(2)
and 268.604 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) When appropriate, the administrative judge may recommend that a class be divided into subclasses and that each
subclass be treated as a class, and the provisions of this section shall then be construed and applied accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The administrative judge's written recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or dismiss a class complaint
and the complaint file shall be transmitted to the Board, and notification of that transmittal shall be sent to the
agent of the class. The administrative judge's recommendation to accept or dismiss shall become the Board's decision
unless the Board accepts, rejects or modifies the recommended decision within 30 days of the receipt of the recommended
decision and complaint file pursuant to &sect;268.209 of this part. The Board shall notify the agent of the class by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and the administrative judge of its decision to accept or dismiss a class
complaint. At the same time, the Board shall forward to the agent of the class copies of the administrative judge's
recommendation and the complaint file. The dismissal of a class complaint shall inform the agent of the class either
that the class complaint is being filed on that date as an individual complaint of discrimination and will be processed
under subpart B of this part, or that the class complaint is also dismissed as an individual complaint in accordance
with &sect;268.206 of this part. In addition, it shall inform the agent of the class of the right to file a request for
review of the dismissal of the class complaint with the Commission pursuant to &sect;268.401 of this part, or to file
a civil action. A copy of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision to dismiss
a class complaint pursuant to &sect;268.209(b)(4) of this part.

Obtaining evidence concerning the complaint.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Upon the acceptance of a class complaint by the Board, the administrative judge shall notify the agent of the class
and the Board's representative of the time period that will be allowed both parties to prepare their case. This time
period will include at least 60 days and may be extended by the administrative judge upon the request of either party.
Both parties are entitled to reasonable development of evidence on matters relevant to the issues raised in the class
complaint. Evidence may be developed through interrogatories, depositions, and requests for admissions, stipulations
or production of documents. It shall be grounds for objection to producing evidence that the information sought by
either party is irrelevant, overburdensome, repetitious, privileged, or that production would be unlawful.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If mutual cooperation fails, either party may request the administrative judge to rule on a request to develop
evidence. If a party fails without good cause shown to respond fully and in timely fashion to a request made or approved
by the administrative judge for documents, records, comparative data, statistics or affidavits, and the information
is solely in the control of one party, such failure may, in appropriate circumstances, cause the administrative judge:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To draw an adverse inference that the requested information would have reflected unfavorably on the party refusing
to provide the requested information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) To consider the matters to which the requested information pertains to be established in favor of the opposing
party;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) To exclude other evidence offered by the party failing to produce the requested information;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) To recommend that a decision be entered in favor of the opposing party; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) To take such other actions as the administrative judge deems appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) During the period for development of evidence, the administrative judge may, in his or her discretion, direct
that an investigation of facts relevant to the class complaint or any portion be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Both parties shall furnish to the administrative judge copies of all materials that they wish to be examined and
such other material as may be requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Opportunity for resolution of the class complaint.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The administrative judge shall furnish the agent of the class and the Board's representative a copy of all materials
obtained concerning the class complaint and provide opportunity for the agent of the class to discuss the materials
with the Board's representative and to attempt resolution of the class complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The class complaint may be resolved by agreement of the Board and the agent of the class at any time as long as the agreement
is fair and reasonable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the class complaint is resolved, the terms of the resolution shall be reduced to writing and signed by the agent
of the class and the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Notice of the agreement of resolution shall be given to all class members in the same manner as notification of the
acceptance of the class complaint and shall state the relief, if any, to be granted by the Board. An agreement of resolution
shall bind all members of the class. Within 30 days of the date of the notice of the agreement of resolution, any member
of the class may petition the Commission to vacate the agreement of resolution because it benefits only the agent of
the class or is otherwise not fair and reasonable. Such a petition will be processed in accordance with paragraph (c)
of this section and if the administrative judge finds that the agreement of resolution is not fair and reasonable,
he or she shall recommend that the agreement of resolution be vacated and that the original agent of the class be replaced
by the petitioner or some other class member who is eligible to be the agent of the class during further processing of
the class complaint. The Board may determine, with respect to the petition, that the agreement of resolution is not
fair and reasonable, which vacates any agreement between the former agent of the class and the Board. The Board's decision
to vacate the agreement of resolution shall be communicated to the former agent of the class and to the petitioner,
and shall inform them of their right to file a request for review with the Commission under &sect;268.401 of this part.
A copy of EEOC Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition, shall be attached to the Board's decision pursuant to &sect;268.209(b)(5)
of this part.

Relief for an applicant. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) (i) When it is determined in a final decision that an applicant for employment has been discriminated against,
the Board shall offer the applicant for employment the position that the applicant for employment would have occupied
absent discrimination or, if justified by the circumstances, a substantially equivalent position unless clear
and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant for employment would not have been selected even absent the
discrimination. The offer to the applicant for employment shall be made in writing. The applicant for employment
shall have 15 days from receipt of the offer within which to accept or decline the offer. Failure to accept the offer
within the 15-day period will be considered a declination of the offer, unless the applicant for employment can show
that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented a response within the time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the offer is accepted, appointment shall be retroactive to the date the applicant for employment would have
been hired. Back pay, computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 shall be awarded from the date the applicant
for employment would have entered on duty until the date the applicant for employment actually enters on duty unless
clear and convincing evidence indicates that the applicant would not have been selected even absent discrimination.
Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation where sovereign immunity has been waived. An applicant
for employment shall be deemed to have performed service at the Board during such period for all purposes except for
meeting service requirements for completion of a required probationary period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the offer of employment is declined, the Board shall award the applicant for employment a sum equal to the back
pay he or she would have received, computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 from the date he or she would have
been appointed until the date the offer was declined, subject to the limitation of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.
Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation. The Board shall inform the applicant for employment,
in its offer of employment, of the right to this award in the event the offer of employment is declined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When it is determined in a final decision that discrimination existed at the time the applicant for employment
was considered for employment but also by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant would not have been hired
even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless take all steps necessary to eliminate the discriminatory
practice and ensure it does not recur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Back pay under this paragraph (b) for complaints under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act may not extend from a
date earlier than two years prior to the date on which the complaint was initially filed by the applicant for employment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Nondiscriminatory placement, with back pay computed in the manner prescribed in 5 CFR 550.805 unless clear and
convincing evidence contained in the record demonstrates that the personnel action would have been taken even absent
the discrimination. Interest on back pay shall be included in the back pay computation where sovereign immunity has
been waived. The back pay liability under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act is limited to the two years prior to the
date the discrimination complaint was filed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If clear and convincing evidence indicates that, although discrimination existed at the time the personnel action
was taken, the personnel action would have been taken even absent discrimination, the Board shall nevertheless eliminate
any discriminatory practice and ensure it does not recur; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cancellation of an unwarranted personnel action and restoration of the employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Expunction from the Board's records of any adverse materials relating to the discriminatory practice; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

evidence that the employee or applicant for employment has failed to mitigate damages. The Board shall have the burden
of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the complainant has failed to mitigate his or her damages.

Awards of attorney's fees or costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The provisions of this paragraph (e) relating to the award of attorney's fees or costs shall apply to allegations of
discrimination prohibited by Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act. In a notice of final action or a decision, the employee
or applicant for employment may be awarded reasonable attorney's fees or costs (including expert witness fees) incurred
in the processing of the complaint. In this regard: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A finding of discrimination raises a presumption of entitlement to an award of attorney's fees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Attorney's fees are allowable only for the services of members of the Bar and law clerks, paralegals or law students
under the supervision of members of the Bar, except that no award is allowable for the services of any employee of the
Federal Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Attorney's fees shall be paid only for services performed after the filing of a written complaint and after the
complainant has notified the Board that he or she is represented by an attorney, except that fees allowable for a reasonable
period of time prior to the notification of representation for any services performed in reaching a determination
to represent the complainant. Written submissions to the Board that are signed by the representative shall be deemed
to constitute notice of representation.

Amount of awards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) When the attorney's fees or costs are awarded, the complainant's attorney shall submit a verified statement of
costs and attorney's fees (including expert witness fees), as appropriate, to the Board within 30 days of receipt
of the final decision, unless a request for review or reconsideration is filed. A statement of attorney's fees shall
be accompanied by an affidavit executed by the attorney of record itemizing the attorney's charges for legal services
and both the verified statement and the accompanying affidavit shall be made a part of the complaint file. The amount
of attorney's fees or costs to be awarded the complainant shall be determined by agreement among the complainant,
the complainant's representative and the Board. Such agreement shall immediately be reduced to writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) (A) If the complainant, the complainant's representative and the Board cannot reach an agreement on the amount
of attorney's fees or costs within 20 days of the Board's receipt of the verified statement and accompanying affidavit,
the Board shall issue a decision determining the amount of attorney's fees or costs due within 30 days of receipt of
the statement and affidavit. The decision of the Board shall include the specific reasons for determining the amount
of the award. The complainant or the complainant's representative may file a request for review with the Commission
of the Board's decision, and the Board's notice to the complainant and his or her representative shall include EEOC
Form 573, notice of Appeal/Petition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) The amount of attorney's fees shall be calculated in accordance with existing case law using the following standards:
The starting point shall be the number of hours reasonably expended multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. This amount
may be reduced or increased in consideration of the following factors, although ordinarily many of these factors
are subsumed within the calculation set forth in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B): The time and labor required, the novelty
and difficulty of the questions, the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly, the attorney's preclusion
from other employment due to acceptance of the case, the customary fee, whether the fee is fixed or contingent, time
limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, the amount involved and the results obtained, the experience,
reputation, and ability of the attorney, the undesirability of the case, the nature and length of the professional
relationship with the client, and the awards in similar cases. Only in cases of exceptional success should any of these
factors be used to enhance an award computed by the formula set forth in this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The costs that may be awarded are those authorized by 28 U.S.C. 1920 to include: Fees of the reporter for all or any
of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; fees and disbursements for printing and
witnesses; and fees for exemplification and copies necessarily obtained for use in the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Witness fees shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C. 1821, except that no award shall

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, when the Board requests reconsideration, when the case involves
an employee's removal, separation, or suspension continuing beyond the date of the request for reconsideration,
and when the EEOC decision recommends retroactive restoration, the Board shall comply with the EEOC decision only
to the extent of the temporary or conditional restoration of the employee to duty status in the position recommended

that the Board has failed to comply with the terms of a settlement agreement or a final decision, the complainant shall
notify the EEO Programs Director, in writing, of the alleged noncompliance within 30 days of when the complainant
knew or should have known of the alleged noncompliance. The complainant may request that the Board implement the terms
of the settlement agreement or final decision or alteratively, that the complaint be reinstated for further processing
from the point processing ceased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Board shall attempt to resolve the matter brought to the Board's attention by the complainant in paragraph
(a) of this section, and respond to the complainant, in writing. If the Board has not responded to the complainant,
in writing, or if the complainant is not satisfied with the Board's attempt to resolve the matter, the complainant
may request the Commission to review whether the Board has complied with the terms of the settlement agreement or the
final decision. The complainant may file such request for review 35 days after he or she has served the Board with the
notice of allegations of noncompliance, but must file the request for review with the Commission within 30 days of
his or her receipt of a Board's determination. The complainant must serve a copy of the request for review on the Board
and the Board may submit a response to the Commission within 30 days of receiving notice of request for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to rendering its determination, the Commission may request that the parties submit whatever additional
information or documentation they deem necessary, or it may direct that an investigation or hearing on the matter
be conducted. If the Commission determines that the Board is not in compliance and the noncompliance is not attributable
to acts or conduct of the complainant, it may order that the complaint be reinstated for further processing from the
point processing ceased. Allegations that subsequent acts of discrimination violate a settlement agreement shall
be processed as separate complaints under &sect;&sect;268.205 or 268.305 of this part, as appropriate, rather than
under this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Board shall collect and maintain accurate employment information on the race, national origin, sex and disabilities
of its employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Data on race, national origin and sex shall be collected by voluntary self-identification. If an employee does
not voluntarily provide the requested information, the Board shall advise the employee of the importance of the data
and of the Board's obligation to report it. If the employee still refuses to provide the information, the Board shall
make a visual identification and inform the employee of the data it will be reporting. If the Board believes that information
provided by an employee is inaccurate, the Board shall advise the employee that the purpose for which the data is being
collected is solely statistical, of the need for accuracy, of the Board's recognition of the sensitivity of the information,
and of the existence of procedures to prevent its unauthorized disclosure. If, thereafter, the employee declines
to change the apparently inaccurate self identification, the Board shall accept it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Subject to applicable law, the information collected under paragraph (b) of this section shall be disclosed only
in the form of gross statistics. The Board will not collect or maintain any information on the race, national origin,
or sex of individual employees except in accordance with applicable law and when an automated data processing system
is used in accordance with standards and requirements prescribed by the Commission to insure individual privacy
and the separation of that information from the employee's personnel record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Board's system shall incorporate the following controls:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Only those categories of race and national origin approved by the Commission shall be used; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Only the specific procedures for the collection and maintenance of data that are prescribed or approved by the
Commission shall be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Board shall use the data only in studies and analyses that contribute affirmatively to achieving the objectives
of the Board's equal employment opportunity program. The Board shall not establish quotas for the employment of persons
on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Data on disabilities shall also be collected by voluntary self-identification. If an employee does not voluntarily
provide the requested information, the Board shall advise the employee of the importance of the data and of the Board's
obligation to report it. If an employee who has been appointed pursuant to the Board's affirmative action program
for hiring individuals with a disability still refuses to provide the requested information, the Board shall identify
the employee's disability based upon the records supporting the appointment. If any other employee still refuses
to provide the requested information or provides information that the Board believes to be inaccurate, the Board
shall report the employee's disability status as unknown.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The Board shall report to the Commission on employment by race, national origin, sex and disability in the form
and at such times as the Board and Commission shall agree.

the complainant shall have the right to be accompanied, represented and advised by a representative of complainant's
choice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the complainant is an employee of the Board, he or she shall have a reasonable amount of official time, if otherwise
on duty, to prepare the complaint and to respond to Board and Commission requests for information. If the complainant
is an employee of the Board and he or she designates another employee of the Board as his or her representative, the representative
shall have a reasonable amount of official time, if otherwise on duty, to prepare the complaint and respond to Board
and Commission requests for information. The Board is not obligated to change work schedules, incur overtime wages,
or pay travel expenses to facilitate the choice of a specific representative or to allow the complainant and representative
to confer. The complainant and the representative, if employed by the Board and otherwise in a pay status, shall be
on official time, regardless of their tours of duty, when their presence is authorized or required by the Board or the
Commission during the investigation, informal adjustment, or hearing on the complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In cases where the representation of a complainant or the Board would conflict with the official or collateral
duties of the representative, the Board may, after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, disqualify
the representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Unless the complainant states otherwise in writing, after the Board has received written notice of the name, address
and telephone number of a representative, all official correspondence shall be with the representative with copies
to the complainant. When the complainant designates an attorney as representative, service of documents and decisions
on the complaint shall be made on the attorney and not on the complainant, and time frames for receipt of materials by
the complainant shall be computed from the time of receipt by the attorney. The complainant must serve all official
correspondence on the designated representative of the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The complainant shall at all times be responsible for proceeding with the complaint whether or not he or she has
designated a representative.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviations Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as
stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the TERPs. Because of the close
and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure
before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable,
that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the
anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations governing the Customs field organization by establishing Santa Teresa,
New Mexico, as a port of entry. The document also establishes the Santa Teresa Airport, which is within the boundaries
of the port of entry, as a designated airport for the purposes of report of arrival and Customs clearance. Currently,
Santa Teresa is a temporary Customs station, and Santa Teresa Airport is operating as a landing rights airport. Because
of the traffic in the area which already exists, and the anticipated growth in that traffic, Customs has determined
that a need exists to create a port of entry at Santa Teresa. Through this change, the general public and importers will
be served better and Customs personnel and resources will be more efficiently utilized.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As part of its continuing program to obtain more efficient use of its personnel, facilities and resources, and to provide
better service to carriers, importers and the public, Customs is amending &sect;101.3, Customs Regulations (19
CFR 101.3), by establishing a port of entry at Santa Teresa, New Mexico and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is amending &sect;122.24(b) by adding the Santa Teresa Airport to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of airports designated as airports at which private aircraft arriving in the Continental U.S. via the U.S.
- Mexican border from a foreign place in the Western Hemisphere south of the U.S. can land. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customs published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 33462) on July 29, 1992, proposing these actions and inviting the public to comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received in response to the proposal. After further review, Customs has determined to amend the regulations
as proposed. Until this amendment becomes effective, the only port of entry along the New Mexico-Mexico border is
located in the far western portion of the state. Because the amount of traffic in the Santa Teresa area has increased
recently, Customs has established, as an interim measure, a temporary Customs station at Santa Teresa under the authority
of &sect;101.4(d), Customs Regulations. The airport at Santa Teresa, which recently lost its status as a user fee
airport by operation of law, is now operating as a landing rights airport. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Establishing Santa Teresa as a Port of Entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The criteria for determining whether a port of entry should be established by Customs was initially identified in
T.D. 82&hyph;37 on March 9, 1982 (47 FR 10137). The criteria in that T.D. were subsequently revised by T.D. 86&hyph;14
(February 5, 1986, 51 FR 4559) and T.D. 87&hyph;65 (May 4, 1987, 52 FR 16328). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria used by Customs in determining whether a port of entry shall be established are whether the community
requesting creation of the port can: (1) Demonstrate that the benefits to be derived justify the Federal Government
expense involved; (2) be serviced by at least two major modes of transportation (rail, air, water, or highway); and
(3) has a minimum population of 300,000 within the immediate service area (approximately a 70-mile radius). In addition,
T.D. 82&hyph;37 provides that the actual or potential Customs workload (minimum number of transactions per year)
must meet one of several alternate criteria, one of which is 2,500 consumption entries (each valued over $1000.00)
of which no more than half can be attributed to one private party. Finally, T.D. 82&hyph;37 provides that the facilities
at the location must include adequate warehousing space for secure storage of imported cargo pending final Customs
inspection and release, and administrative office space, inspection areas, storage areas and other space necessary
for regular Customs operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Commissioner of the Southwest Region has reported to Customs Headquarters that the Santa Teresa area
is well served by air, rail, and highway modes of transportation. The population within a 70-mile radius of the port
is contained in a variety of jurisdictional units and communities. Both El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico are within
that radius, as are several smaller communities. The 1990 El Paso County estimated population was over 606,000, while
Dona Ana County, New Mexico added another 15,000. The estimated 1990 population of Juarez, Mexico is 1.2 million.
All these figures are expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Creation of a port of entry at Santa Teresa
will more evenly distribute the vehicular traffic which is currently forced to pass through El Paso, Texas. There
is significant construction taking place in and around the vicinity of Santa Teresa to build inspection booths and
stations, administration buildings and other support facilities to allow Customs to perform its mission in a safe
and efficient manner. The Mexican Government was instrumental in assisting construction of a new paved road to the
border from Mexico which was completed in early October 1993. Customs has received commitments from several corporate
importers that they will utilize Santa Teresa as a port of entry once it becomes operational. Studies conducted by
several sources have indicated that, once the port becomes operational, over 25,000 commercial vehicles will use
the port per year, and approximately 6,000 consumption entries will be filed per year at the land border port. The local
Chamber of Commerce reports that several corporations have expressed interest in locating in the area in anticipation
of Santa Teresa's being designated a port of entry by Customs. Economic benefits, in the form of additional employment,
are already being felt in the community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period Santa Teresa has been operating as a temporary Customs station, Customs has achieved notable results
in obtaining commitments from the trade community regarding their use of electronic data input for the processing
of entries. Currently, most of the brokers or importers filing entries are automated. No current importer dominates
the scene, and, as the surrounding infrastructure continues to improve, additional entities have expressed their
intentions to utilize the port. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the only port of entry along the New Mexico-Mexico border is located in the far western portion of the state.
Diplomatic negotiations have been held with the Government of Mexico concerning the creation of a port of entry at
Santa Teresa, and both governments are in agreement with such an action.

Port of Entry Boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundaries of the port of entry of Santa Teresa are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning at the junction of the boundary between Texas and New Mexico with the U.S.-Mexico border, west, along the
Mexico-U.S. border until it intersects the range line between Range 1 East and Range 2 East, New Mexico Principal Meridian;
at that point, north along that range line until it reaches the line between Township 27 South and Township 28 South;
then east along the Township line until it reaches the Texas-New Mexico border; then south-east along the Texas-New
Mexico border to the beginning point.

Santa Teresa Airport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, Customs is also amending &sect;122.24(b) by adding the Santa Teresa Airport, which is within the boundaries
of the port of entry, to the list of airports designated as airports at which private aircraft arriving in the Continental
U.S. must report intended arrival pursuant to &sect;122.23(b) and land for Customs processing in accordance with
&sect;122.24(b). Section 122.23(b) provides, essentially, that all private aircraft arriving in the Continental
U.S. via the U.S.-Mexican border, from a foreign place in the Western Hemisphere south of 33 degrees north latitude,
or from any place in Mexico, shall furnish notice of intended arrival to Customs at the nearest designated airport
to the point of crossing for the first landing in the U.S. &sect;122.24 provides that such aircraft shall land for Customs
processing at the nearest designated airport to the border or coastline crossing point. At present, there is no designated
airport in the State of New Mexico. The identification of the Santa Teresa Airport as a designated airport by Customs
will benefit the flying public by increasing the options available for reporting arrival and obtaining Customs processing.
The addition of this airport will also reduce delays at existing designated airports by permitting a better distribution
of the inspection burden.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense is engaged in a major downsizing, resulting in less land and buildings needed to support
defense missions. Congressional legislation in 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;526) and 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510) provided
for non-partisan Commissions to assess the closure recommendations of the Secretary of Defense, and make base closure
and realignment recommendations to the President and the Congress. The bases recommended for closure and realignment
by the 1988, 1991, 1993 Commissions were all approved under this process. Another Commission will meet in 1995. As
a result of the 1988, 1991 and 1993 actions, the Department of Defense is now in the process of closing 70 major installations
throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even in large cities a military base often represents a major employment center and a significant economic stimulus
for the local economy. With its multimillion dollar payrolls a base closure can be a serious blow to the local community.
The Department of Defense recognizes that the manner in which real and personal property at closing bases is disposed
of can have a dramatic impact on the local community's prospects for economic recovery. In the past, the traditional
property disposal methods focused on maximizing proceeds from the sale of real and personal property with little
regard for enhancing the prospects for economic recovery in the community. Recognizing that the old way of doing business
was not designed to dispose of major military installations in a way that would revitalize base closure communities,
President Clinton announced, on July 2, 1993, a major new program to speed the economic recovery of communities where
military bases are slated to close. In a sharp departure from the past, the Clinton Administration pledged to give
top priority to early reuse of the base's valuable assets. Rapid redevelopment and the creation of new jobs in base
closure communities are the goals of the new initiative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In announcing the program, the President outlined the following five parts of his community reinvestment program:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Jobs-centered property disposal that puts local economic redevelopment first.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Fast-track environmental cleanup that removes needless delays while protecting human health and the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transition coordinators at major bases slated for closure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Easy access to transition and redevelopment help for workers and communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Larger economic development planning grants to base closure communities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the task of remaking the economic foundation of a community is never easy, a closed military base can be a community's
single greatest asset in charting a new future. An airfield, a port, or the land, buildings, furniture and equipment
on a base can be a catalyst for new economic activity. The Administration's plan to make base property more affordable
to communities for the purpose of job creation is a fundamental change. It allows communities that have viable plans
for economic redevelopment to obtain property at prices within their means. The President's Five-Part Plan was an
important step in steering the base closure and reuse process toward rapid job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In announcing the community revitalization program, President Clinton recognized that existing Federal law required
the Department of Defense to charge full price when closed bases will be used for job-creating economic development,
yet it can transfer bases for free for a variety of ``public'' uses, including recreation, aviation, education and
health. President Clinton stated that the Administration would seek to change the law, to enable the Department of
Defense to transfer property for free or at a discount for economic development purposes, when community development
plans meet a strict test for economic viability and job creation. Accordingly, the President asked the National Economic
Council (NEC) an interagency coordinating arm of the White House and the Department of Defense to draft a proposal
that puts economic development at the center of base closure asset disposition. The NEC convened an interagency working
group that created the following framework for base disposal:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Where a ready market does not exist, make property available to the local redevelopment authority, without initial
cost, for economic development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Congress, mindful of the need to reform this process, endorsed the President's plan by authorizing Title XXIX
of Public Law 103&hyph;160, Base Closure Communities Assistance, the so-called ``Pryor Amendment''. Based largely
on legislation sponsored by Senator Pryor, the provisions of Title XXIX provide the legal authority to carry out the
President's plan by, among other things, authorizing conveyances of real and personal property at or below fair market
value to local redevelopment authorities, and sharing of profits on subsequent sales and leases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;160 required the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations to implement the provisions
of the law. This is being accomplished under the Administrative Procedures Act which allows for the public to comment
on the regulations. Due to the need to begin acting on the proposed regulations, the Department of Defense has issued
them as interim final rules which allow actions at closing bases to begin before the regulations are made final after
the public comment period. The section related to the conveyance of property in consideration of environmental restoration
costs, is issued as a proposed rule and cannot be exercised until a final rule is published following public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Real Property Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Department of Defense no longer needs to retain real property at a closing base, the Department is required
to dispose of the property in accordance with the prescribed screening process in the General Services Administration
property disposal regulations and the new expedited process authorized in Title XXIX. This process permits DoD entities,
other Federal Agencies and homeless providers to identify property they would like to acquire when the base closes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The screening process for real property requires the Department of Defense to identify first what it needs to retain.
Any property excess to the Department of Defense is then made available to other Federal Agencies. Property not needed
by other Federal Agencies is then identified as surplus and reported to the Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) for a determination of suitability for homeless use and publication of such properties in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Property that has no homeless interest, as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), will
then be available for transfer by either direct sale to the public, negotiated conveyance to the local redevelopment
authority, public benefit conveyances for airports, schools, ports, etc., or the new economic development conveyance
discussed in paragraph 5. of this summary. The Military Departments will work with the other Department of Defense
Components, Federal Agencies, homeless providers and reuse planners, early in the closure process, to sort out these
requests. This new process will provide for the early identification of property which will become available for
reuse. This information is critical to the local redevelopment authority's ability to design a realistic redevelopment
plan. Agreement with proposed uses, other than for McKinney Act homeless use, is at the discretion of the Military
Departments who have been delegated disposal authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. McKinney Act Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act is a statute designed to permit recognized providers of assistance
to the homeless to receive a high priority in acquiring unneeded land and buildings on Federal properties. Buildings
and land on closing bases provide excellent opportunities for homeless providers to acquire the infrastructure
they need to establish their programs. This section of the interim final rule describes the new process, specifically
tailored for base closure properties, that will expedite the screening process with homeless providers and will
result in the early identification of their needs. The expedited screening process will be pursued in a proactive
manner. The Military Departments will work with communities to identify eligible entities and conduct timely outreach
seminars to educate homeless providers with respect to the land and buildings that will be made available and the process
for making a formal application to HHS to acquire such land and buildings. The early identification of homeless assistance
requirements will permit communities to develop reuse plans that fully accommodate homeless needs, while permitting
early identification of the remaining property for quick sale to create jobs, a Federally-sponsored public benefit
conveyance, or conveyance to a local redevelopment authority for economic development purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Local Redevelopment Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The early formation of a local redevelopment authority is critical to the successful reuse of the base. The primary
focus of the local redevelopment authority should be developing a comprehensive local redevelopment plan. This
plan should embrace the range of feasible reuse options that will result in rapid job creation. The local redevelopment
plan will generally be used as the proposed action when the disposing Military Department conducts the environmental
analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Jobs-Centered Property Disposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new property disposal process described in this section and in paragraphs 5. and 6. of this summary, is designed
to rapidly create new jobs. In most cases, that will occur through conveyances for economic development, without
initial cost, as described in paragraph 5. However, in a few cases, an entire base or a substantial portion of it will
have a high value and hence a ready market for development. In such cases, market sale of the property may be the most
effective way to rapidly create new jobs.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Military Department will identify properties having a ready market and begin the appraisal process as soon as
possible but not later than 6 months after completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process in paragraph
2. of this summary. The appraisals should take into consideration uncertainties and the associated risks in property
development as well as the impact of the base closure on market conditions. Moreover, the appraisal will reflect the
most likely range of uses consistent with local interests rather than highest and best use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist in determining the estimated fair market value, the Military Departments will solicit for expressions
of interest for the entire or a substantial portion of the base for a period no longer than 6 months. The results will
be shared with the local redevelopment authority. Expressions of interest will be solicited simultaneously with
other screening and disposal actions and will not cause a delay in the disposal process. The Military Departments
will analyze each expression of interest and determine if it represents a reasonable proposal that is likely to lead
to rapid development and job creation. If after consulting extensively with the local community, the Military Department
makes a favorable determination, the Department may decide to offer the property for sale. The local redevelopment
authority will be promptly notified of the decision and may challange the decision. If the Military Department nevertheless
decides to proceed with the sale, potential bidders will be strongly encouraged to work with the local redevelopment
authority so that their proposals are compatible with the local redevelopment plan. Identifying a substantial portion
of the base for sale, however, does not preclude the community's acquisition of the property through a negotiated
sale with the Department of Defense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that a base or substantial portion thereof, is identified as potentially valuable but does not sell due
to the absence of a ready market, the property will then be available for conveyance for public benefit or, economic
development purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout this process, the Military Departments will make maximum effort to give community considerations a high
priority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Economic Development Conveyances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Closing military bases often have a great deal of land that may not be readily developable or marketable due to its location.
Additionally, closing bases often have buildings that may need to be demolished in order to encourage redevelopment
and economic revitalization. Historically, the process of selling bases, or parts thereof, for fair market value
has been time consuming and the proceeds from the few sales of base closure properties have been less than originally
anticipated. In the past, the law permitted the Department of Defense to convey property at a discount of up to 100 percent
(free of charge) for specific public purposes such as health, aviation, recreation, and education_but not for economic
development. The new authority permits the DoD to convey land and buildings to redevelopment authorities initially
for free, after it is determined that the base, or significant portions thereof, cannot be sold in accordance with
the rapid job creation concept. Such conveyances may help induce a market for the property, thereby, enhancing economic
recovery. Redevelopment authorities requesting an economic development conveyance, shall submit a simple written
request containing four basic elements as described in the interim rule. Generally, installations will be conveyed
at no initial cost with a recoupment provision that will permit the Department of Defense to share in any future profits
should the base be later leased or sold. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed under this authority at no cost and with
no recoupment if they meet the standards as detailed in the interim rule. The conveyance for economic development
should be used by local redevelopment authorities to gain control of large areas of the base, not just individual buildings.
The income received from some of the higher value property should help offset the maintenance and marketing costs
of the less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide
an income stream to assist the long term development of the property.

6. Profit Sharing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When real property is conveyed as described in paragraph 5. of this summary, DoD shall generally share in the division
of future profits should the property be subsequently sold or leased. The division of profits shall be based on net
profits and the share shall generally favor the local redevelopment authority. There shall be a 15-year time limit
on the share of the profits. The government's portion of the receipts from the profit shall not exceed the estimated
fair market value of the property at the time of conveyance to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Leasing of Real Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Leasing of real property early in the reuse process is an effective way to quickly attract new jobs to replace those
that have been lost by the base closing. In the past, the requirement to lease at fair market value discouraged the creation
of new jobs. The new leasing process, at less than fair market value, will provide new incentives for redevelopment
authorities and businesses alike to spur job creation and speed economic redevelopment. Inasmuch as the Department

suitable economic reuse to occur on substantial portions of closing bases.

8. Personal Property
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal property located on closing bases is often very useful to the redevelopment of the real property. This section
of the interim final rule outlines procedures to allow transfer of personal property with the real property in many
cases. It provides for completing an inventory soon after the base is approved for closure and consultation with local
officials. This consultation may include a walkthrough of the base to familiarize local officials with potentially
available property. The community can then identify the personal property it wishes to retain in its redevelopment
plan. The Department of Defense will keep a great deal of the personal property at the base while the redevelopment
plan is being put together. Only valid exemptions will be made to this freeze, usually involving specific military
requirements or property which the base does not own. Emissions trading procedures will be issued separately and
are not covered by the interim final rule.

Facilities and equipment located on closing bases are often important to the eventual reuse. This section of the interim
rule below provides procedures to protect their condition while the redevelopment plan is being put together. The
level of maintenance will be determined in consultation with the redevelopment authority.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense has determined that this interim rule is not a significant regulatory action, as defined
by Executive Order 12866. The rule does not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities. It provides for transfer of paid-for federal installations no longer needed for economic
development purposes. This will benefit the economy and the communities in which the closing bases are located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12886. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been certified that this interim final rule is not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601) because
the interim final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary
effect of the interim final rule will be to reduce the burden on local communities of the Government's property disposal
process at closing military installations and to accelerate the economic recovery of the relatively small number
of communities that will be affected by the closure of nearby military installations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule is not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act because it imposes no obligatory information requirements
beyond internal DoD use.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is DoD policy to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Help communities impacted by base closures achieve rapid economic recovery through effective reuse of the assets
of closing bases_more quickly, more effectively and in ways based on local market conditions and locally developed
reuse plans_by implementing the President's Five-Part Plan that encourages:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Transferring real and personal property expeditiously to local redevelopment authorities and in ways that enhance
economic development and job creation or other public benefits. This can best be accomplished by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Making transfers of property to a redevelopment authority for economic development affordable, when necessary
to foster community redevelopment plans. The use of existing public benefit conveyances should be considered, where
appropriate, before the use of a public benefit conveyance for economic development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Accelerating the property screening process early in the disposal process to determine other potential Federal
uses of the property, including the identification of the needs of homeless providers. This will determine how much
of the property is available for early economic development and/or other community reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Informing communities, as early as possible after the base closure decision is final, if an installation will
be considered for ``economic development'' conveyances under Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160, Title XXIX and will not be
offered for sale, instead. Such decisions shall be based on a determination that the existence of a ready market for
the property indicates that public or private developers can not be relied upon as the preferable mechanism to spur
economic redevelopment and the creation of new jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Encouraging interim leases at less than the estimated fair market value in order to facilitate State or local
economic redevelopment efforts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(v) Delegating authority to approve interim leases and simple land transfers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Considering the personal property requirements of the community redevelopment plan when making decisions
on the disposition of base equipment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Ensuring fast-track environmental cleanup of closing bases to permit earlier determination of property suitable
for either conveyance or lease. The key elements of this initiative are to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Establish a base realignment and closure cleanup team composed of members from the Department of Defense, the
Environmental Protection Agency and State regulatory agencies, at every base where property is available for transfer
and reuse. The team shall prepare the base realignment and closure cleanup plan and make decisions to expedite the
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Quickly identify and document uncontaminated real property parcels to permit timely reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Identify opportunities to convey property quickly to those willing to pay the cost of cleaning up the contaminated
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Ensure analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190; 10 U.S.C. 4332 et. seq.)
process are produced in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Establish procedures for identifying and documenting parcels of real property that are environmentally suitable
for lease, even if needed mitigation precludes conveyance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Improve public involvement in the environmental cleanup by establishing and seeking public participation
in Restoration Advisory Boards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Providing full time base transition coordinators at major installations slated for closure or substantial realignment.
The principal functions of the coordinators shall be to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Assist in cutting through red tape on property disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Assist in keeping the environmental cleanup on a fast track.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Assist the DoD Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) in helping communities identify sources of Federal assistance
for developing and implementing economic redevelopment plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Providing easy access to transition and redevelopment help for workers and communities by targeting major sources
of Federal funding assistance to base closure communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Providing larger economic development planning grants to base closure communities. Planning grants should
be approved quickly. The Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment will move beyond the traditional
role of providing grants for planning to helping communities transition from planning to implementation by funding
a portion of the staff required for implementation of the local redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Follow the following framework in implementing Title XXIX of Pub. L. 103&hyph;160:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Where a ready market exists, complete screening and then sell properties quickly for public or private development
to speed up job creation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where a ready market does not exist, make property available to the local redevelopment authority without initial
consideration, for economic development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Share the net profits between the Department of Defense and the local redevelopment authority if a property conveyed
without initial consideration for economic development is subsequently leased or sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This regulation does not create any rights or remedies and may not be relied upon by any person, organization, or
other entity to allege a denial of any rights or remedies other than those provided by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, Title XXIX.

It is DoD policy to help communities affected by base closures achieve rapid economic recovery through effective
reuse of the assets of closing bases_more quickly, more effectively and in ways based on local market conditions and
locally developed reuse plans. This will be accomplished by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Selling properties quickly for public or private development to speed up job creation where a ready market exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Making property available without initial consideration for economic development where a ready market does
not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Sharing the net profits between the DoD and the local redevelopment authority if a property conveyed without initial
consideration for economic development is subsequently sold or leased.

Procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Real property screening.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the Department of Defense no longer needs to retain real property, the Department is required to dispose of
the property in accordance with the prescribed screening process in the General Services Administration property
disposal regulations and the expedited process described in this part. This process permits DoD entities, other
Federal Agencies and homeless providers to identify property they would like to acquire when the base closes. The
Secretary concerned will work with the other DoD Components, Federal Agencies, homeless providers and reuse planners,
early in the closure process, to sort out these requests. This process will provide for the early identification of
property which will become available for reuse that is critical to the local redevelopment authority's ability to
develop a realistic reuse plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Military Departments should complete the internal DoD real property screening of closing and realigning
base property:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By April 1, 1994, for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Within 4 months of the date of approval of the 1995 closures and realignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Military Departments should seek local redevelopment authority input in making determinations on the retention
of property and should consider their input, if provided. Transfer of real property at closing and realigning bases
between any of the Military Departments, or retention of real property at a closing base by a Military Department,
must be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Economic Security, unless such a transfer has already been
approved by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Formal screening of real property excess to the DoD with other Federal Agencies must be completed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By June 1, 1994, for 1988, 1991, and 1993 closures and realignments unless the community requests a postponement
of the surplus determination as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) Within 6 months of the date of approval of the 1995 closures and realignments unless the community requests a postponement
as provided in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) These timeframes afford Federal Agencies sufficient time to assess their needs, submit initial expressions
of interest to the Department of Defense, and apply for the property. During this period, Agencies sponsoring public
benefit conveyances should also consider the suitability for such purposes. The Military Departments should provide
other Federal Agencies as full and complete information as practicable on the property in the Notice of Availability.
Requests for transfers of property submitted by other Federal Agencies will normally be accommodated. Decisions
on the transfer of property to other Federal Agencies shall be made by the Military Department concerned in consultation
with the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Military Departments should make the notices of availability available to the local redevelopment authorities,
State and local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Within the 6 month screening period in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Military Departments shall consult
with the local redevelopment authority and make appropriate final determinations whether a Federal Agency has identified
a use for, or shall accept transfer of, any portion of the property. If no Federal Agency requests the property, the
property shall be declared surplus. However, the local redevelopment authority may request the Military Department
concerned to delay this final surplus declaration. All requests for delay must be in writing and made before May 1,
1994 for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments and within 5 months of the approval of the 1995 base closures
and realignments. If there is a Federal Agency request for transfer, the Secretary concerned may postpone the determination
to transfer and the Secretary may also postpone the determination of surplus for all or any part of the property at the
installation for such period as the Secretary concerned determines is in the best interest of the communities affected
by the closure of the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Screening of real property with State and local government agencies shall take place concurrently with McKinney
Act screening. The screening notice should state:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uses to assist the homeless shall take precedence unless the Secretary concerned or the Secretary of Health and Human
Services (HHS) determines that a competing request under 40 U.S.C. 484(k) is so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh
the needs of the homeless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Withdrawn public domain lands are those lands which have been transferred from the Department of Interior to a
Military Department for its temporary use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) These lands on closing or realigning bases are to be returned to the Secretary of Interior when the Secretary of
the Military Department concerned no longer has need for these lands, if they are still suitable for the programs of
the Secretary of Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Military Department concerned will notify the Secretary of Interior, normally through the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), when withdrawn public domain lands are included within an installation to be closed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The Bureau of Land Management will screen these lands within the Department of Interior to determine if these
lands are suitable for return to the Department of Interior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the lands are not suitable for the programs of the Secretary of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management will
so notify the Military Department and state that these lands should be processed as the other real property on the base.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Military Department will notify the Bureau of Land Management that it concurs with the determination and will
proceed in accordance with the real property screening procedures described in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) McKinney Act Screening. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 11301), is a statute designed to permit
HHS-approved providers of assistance to the homeless to receive a high priority in acquiring unneeded land and buildings
on Federal properties. Buildings and land on closing bases provide excellent opportunities for homeless providers
to acquire the land and buildings they need to establish their programs. This section describes the new process specifically
tailored for base closure properties that will expedite the screening process with homeless providers and will result
in the early identification of their needs. The Military Departments will work with communities to identify eligible
entities and conduct timely outreach seminars to educate homeless providers with respect to the land and buildings
that will be made available and the process for making a formal application to the Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS). The early identification of homeless assistance requirements for land and buildings at closing bases will
permit communities to develop reuse plans that fully accommodate homeless needs, while permitting early identification
of the remaining property for either quick sale for job creation, a federally sponsored public benefit conveyance
or conveyance to a local redevelopment authority for economic development purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is required to publish by February 15 of each year a list of
all the properties which were published in accordance with the McKinney Act in the previous calendar year. For the
purpose of reporting properties to HUD pursuant to the new expedited McKinney screening process described in this
section, the Military Departments should report only those properties which remain available as of the reporting
date. For the purposes of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which an expression of interest has been received by HHS from a
homeless provider, but a final HHS determination has not yet been made, shall be reported for screening under the new
procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which no expression of interest has been received by HHS from
a homeless provider and for which the Department of Defense has received no expression of interest or bona fide offer
in accordance with the provisions of section 501(c)(4)(C) of the McKinney Act, shall be reported in accordance with
the procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Properties listed by HUD in the annual report for which no expression of interest has been received by HHS from
a homeless provider and for which the Department of Defense has received an expression of interest or bona fide offer
in accordance with the provisions of section 501(c)(4)(C) of the McKinney Act, shall not be reported in accordance
with the procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) 1988 and 1991 base closure and realignment properties which remain available shall be reported to HUD in accordance
with the new expedited procedures in paragraphs (b) (3) through (11) of this section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Under the new expedited McKinney Act screening process, the Military Departments shall sponsor a workshop or
seminar in communities having closing or realigning bases before reporting to HUD. All available property at closing
and realigning bases that will become surplus to Federal Agency needs will be reported to HUD:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) By June 1, 1994, for the 1988, 1991, and 1993 closures and realignments, unless the community requests a postponement
of the declaration of surplus under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Within 6 months of the date of approval of the 1995 base closures and realignments unless the community requests
a postponement of the declaration of surplus under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) HUD shall make a determination of the suitability of each property to assist the homeless in accordance with the
McKinney Act. Within 60 days from the date of receipt of the information from the Department of Defense, HUD shall publish
a list of suitable properties that shall become available when the base closes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Providers of assistance to the homeless shall then have 60 days in which to submit to HHS expressions of interest
in any of the listed properties. If a provider indicates an interest in a listed property, it shall have an additional
90 days after submission of its written notice of interest to submit a formal application to HHS, a period which HHS
can extend. HHS shall then have 25 days after receipt of a completed application to review and complete all actions
on such applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) During the new expedited McKinney Act property screening process (from 60 to 175 days following 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
publication, as appropriate), disposal agencies shall take no final disposal action or allow reuse of property that
HUD has determined suitable and that may become available for homeless assistance, unless and until:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) No timely expressions of interest from providers are received by HHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) No timely applications from providers expressing interest are received by HHS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) HHS rejects all applications received for a specific property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) If no provider expresses an interest to HHS in a property within the allotted 60 days, the Military Department should
promptly inform the affected local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, the local governments, and
Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available
for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest
to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) If there are expressions of interest by homeless assistance providers, but no application is received by HHS from
such a provider within the subsequent 90-day application period (or within the longer application period if HHS has
granted an extension), the Military Department should promptly inform the local redevelopment authority, the Governor
of the State, and Federal Agencies that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property
will be available for community reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written
expression of interest to incorporate the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan for the base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) If at any time during the 25 day HHS review period HHS rejects all applications for a specific property, the Military
Department should promptly inform the local redevelopment authority, the Governor of the State, and Federal Agencies
that support authorized public benefit conveyances, of the date the surplus property will be available for community
reuse. The local redevelopment authority shall then have 1 year to submit a written expression of interest to incorporate
the remainder of the property into its redevelopment plan for the base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) During the allotted 1-year period for the local redevelopment authority to submit a written expression of interest
for the property, surplus properties not already approved for homeless reuse shall not be available for homeless
assistance, unless such homeless assistance is included in the local redevelopment authority's plan. The surplus
properties will also not be advertised by HUD as suitable during these 1-year periods. The surplus property may be
available for interim leases to any entity, including local redevelopment authorities as deemed appropriate by
the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(11) If the local redevelopment authority does not express in writing its interest in a specific property during the
allotted 1-year period, the disposal agency shall again notify HUD of the date of availability of the property for
homeless assistance. HUD may then list the property in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as suitable and available after the base closes following the previous McKinney Act procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) The listing of base closure property from the 1991 and subsequent rounds of base closures reported to HUD shall
contain the following statement:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The properties contained in this listing are closing or realigning military installations. This report is being
accomplished pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, section 2905(b). In accordance with section 2905(b), this property
is subject to a one-time publication under the McKinney Act, after which property not provided to homeless assistance
providers will not be published again unless there is no expression of interest submitted by the local redevelopment
authority in the one-year period following the end of the McKinney screening process pursuant to this publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) The list of 1988 base closure properties that will be reported to HUD shall contain the same statement as paragraph
(b)(12) of this section, and shall refer to section 2905(a) of the Act (107 Stat. 1916).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The early formation of a redevelopment authority is critical to the successful reuse of the base. The primary focus
of the redevelopment authority should be developing a comprehensive local redevelopment plan. This plan should
embrace the range of feasible reuse options that will result in rapid job creation. The local redevelopment plan will
generally be used as the proposed action in conducting environmental analyses required by the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), (42 U.S.C. 4332 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Although the statute only requires the local redevelopment authority to submit a written expression of interest
within 1 year after the date the property is released from McKinney Act screening, the local redevelopment plan should
be prepared within that 1 year period. The plan should at a minimum identify:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Parcels recommended to be transferred to other Federal Agencies (whether or not a specific request for such transfer
was made by the Agency during the screening period) and their intended uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Parcels recommended to be transferred or conveyed for uses such as homeless assistance, public benefit purposes,
or other qualifying public purpose conveyance programs and their intended uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Parcels, and their intended uses, recommended to be conveyed by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Negotiated sale at estimated fair market value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Conveyance without initial consideration to local redevelopment authorities, with or without recoupment,
as provided in this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The plan should discuss how it will enhance the prospects for economic development and job creation, if the redevelopment
authority intends to request an economic development conveyance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Jobs-centered property disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The new property disposal process described in this section and in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section which
follow, is designed to rapidly create new jobs, either by taking advantage of a ready market for development of valuable
property or by inducing a market through conveyances for economic development, initially without consideration.
The procedures described below generally apply to 1993 and 1995 base closures and may not apply to 1988 and 1991 closures
which may be well along in the disposal process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The Military Departments should identify properties with potential for rapid job creation and begin, as soon
as possible, but not later than completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening (paragraph (b) of this section),
an appraisal or other estimate of the property's fair market value. Such appraisals or estimates should address a
range of likely market values taking into account: feasible uses for the property; the uncertainties in property
development; and, current market conditions (i.e., recognizing the state of the market after a closure announcement).
The appraisals should not be based on the replacement cost of the properties, since they may not be readily adaptable
for civilian use. Additionally, the appraisal should not be based on the highest and best use, but the most likely range
of uses consistent with local interests. The above appraisal may be accomplished for 1988 and 1991 closures if it is
determined that it would be beneficial to do so and will not delay the disposal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To assist in the appraisal/estimation of fair market value of properties with a potential for rapid job creation,
and to determine if interests exist in properties not originally identified for rapid job creation, the Military
Departments shall, for 1993 and 1995 closures, advertise for expressions of interest in all or any substantial part
of each closing installation. For the 1993 and 1995 closures, the Military Departments shall advertise at the completion
of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process (see paragraph (b) of this section). The Military Departments
may advertise for expressions of interest in all or any substantial part of each closing installation on the 1988 or
1991 closure lists if it is determined that it would be beneficial to do so and will not delay the disposal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Advertisements for expressions of interest shall be open for 6 months. Expressions of interest received should
detail the intended use, the site plan, the jobs estimated to be created, the schedule for development and hiring,
and an evaluation of the worth of the land and buildings. Expressions of interest will be shared with the local redevelopment
authority. Advertisements for expressions of interest will be conducted simultaneously with all other disposal
actions and are not an additional step in the disposal process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Military Departments shall analyze each expression of interest and determine within 30 days of receipt if
it is made in good faith and represents a reasonable development proposal. If the Military Department decides that
an expression of interest received demonstrates the existence of a ready market, the prospect of job creation, and
offers proceeds consistent with the range of estimated fair market value, it may decide to offer the property for sale.
The property proposed for sale shall promptly be publicly identified, and the redevelopment authority shall be notified.
The redevelopment authority may request reconsideration of this decision under paragraph (d)(5) of this section.
Potential offerors will be encouraged to work with the redevelopment authority so that their development goals will
be compatible with the local redevelopment plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a redevelopment plan has not been completed, the redevelopment authority will be encouraged to include the
potential for sale of the property identified by the Military Department under paragraph (d)(3) of this section,
in the plan. The DoD Component will evaluate whether the potential sale of the identified property is covered by any
ongoing environmental analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Based on this evaluation,
consideration can be given to integrating the potential sale into the existing analyses or preparing additional
analyses required by law or otherwise deemed appropriate. The environmental impact statement shall, to the extent
practicable, be completed within 12 months, or a Finding of No Significant Impact issued within 6 months, of the public
announcement identifying the property proposed for sale.

(4) A few high value installations for which a ready market apparently exists may, nevertheless, not have generated
any expressions of interest during the allotted 6 month period. Regardless, such installations provide an opportunity
for private sector rapid job creation which should be pursued. In these cases, the Military Departments, based on
completed appraisals or other estimates of the fair market value, shall inform redevelopment authorities that the
property is expected to be offered for sale and an economic development conveyance should not be anticipated. Redevelopment
authorities shall be so informed as soon as possible, but not later than 6 months after completion of the McKinney Act
screening process. In making these determinations, airport, port, and school property may be excluded if it appears
that they are likely to be converted to public airports, ports or schools under existing public benefit conveyance
programs. The determination that an installation will be sold under paragraph (d)(4) of this section has 2 components:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The property must have a high value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) There must be a ready market. Ready market means that offers to purchase at or near the estimated range of fair market
value from the private sector covering all or most of the installation could be expected within 6 months of advertising
the base for public sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Within 60 days of the announcement by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned of the intention to sell
property in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section, the authorized local redevelopment authority
may request, in writing, that this determination be reconsidered. The Secretary shall consider the request, provide
a final determination in writing to the local redevelopment authority and announce this determination publicly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Identification of an installation or property for sale under this section does not preclude a community's acquisition
of property for the estimated fair market value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments
because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed
to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases of 1988 and 1991 closures where this new property disposal
process is considered not appropriate, the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding
with the disposition of the property.

Economic development conveyances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Closing military bases often have a great deal of land that may not be readily developable or marketable due to its
location. Additionally, closing bases often have buildings that may need to be demolished in order to encourage redevelopment
and economic revitalization. Historically, the process of selling bases, or parts thereof, for fair market value
has been time consuming and the proceeds from the sales of base closure properties have been less than originally anticipated.
In the past, the law permitted the Department of Defense to convey property at a discount of up to 100% (free of charge)
for specific public purposes such as health, aviation, recreation, and education_but not for economic development.
The new process that follows permits the DoD to convey land and buildings to redevelopment authorities with no consideration,
subject to recoupment, after it is determined that the base, or significant portions thereof, cannot be sold in accordance
with the rapid job creation concept. Such conveyances may help induce a market for the property, thereby, enhancing
economic recovery. Redevelopment authorities shall submit a simple written request containing four basic elements
as described in paragraphs (e)(5)(i) through (e)(5)(iv) of this section. Generally, installations will be conveyed
at no initial cost with a recoupment provision that shall permit DoD to share in any future profits should the base be
later leased or sold. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed under this authority with no recoupment if they meet the
standards in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. The conveyance for economic development should be used by local redevelopment
authorities to gain control of large areas of the base, not just individual buildings. The income received from some
of the higher value property should help offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the less desirable parcels.
In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide an income stream to assist
the long term development of the property.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) The Secretary of Defense is authorized by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, Section 2903 to convey real property at an installation
to be closed to the local redevelopment authority for economic development (an economic development conveyance).
The conveyance of property may be for consideration at or below the estimated fair market value, or without consideration.
The consideration, if any, can be paid in cash or in kind. Property to be transferred pursuant to Public Law 103&hyph;160,
section 2903, will be conveyed with no consideration, subject to recoupment as described in paragraph (f) of this
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The economic development conveyance authority is an addition to existing public benefit authorities and, generally,
should not be used when these public benefit authorities would apply. The Military Departments shall prepare a written
explanation why a transfer was made using this economic development conveyance authority for what appears to be a
purpose covered by an existing public benefit authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Before making an economic development conveyance of real property, an appraisal or other estimate of the property's
fair market value shall be made, based on the proposed reuse of the property. The Military Department shall consult
with the local redevelopment authority on appraisal assumptions, guidelines and on instructions given to the appraiser,
but shall be fully responsible for completion of the appraisal. When a property is conveyed for economic development
with no initial consideration, the Military Department shall prepare a written explanation why the estimated fair
market value was not received and retain it in their real property files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Property may be conveyed under Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;160 to an authorized local redevelopment authority for economic
development following submission of a written request to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned disposing
of the property. The requests should contain the following elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Description of the property to be conveyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Statement of the local redevelopment authority's legal authority to acquire and dispose of property under the
laws of the governing State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A redevelopment plan that includes economic development and job creation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A statement explaining why existing public benefit conveyance authorities are not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Installations located in rural areas are of particular concern. An economic development conveyance may be made
without consideration and without recoupment in a rural area when the base closure will have a substantial adverse
impact on the economy of the local community and on the prospect of its economic recovery from the closure. To determine
whether a rural community is eligible for transfer under this section, the Secretary concerned shall first determine
whether the closure will have a substantial adverse impact on the prospect for economic recovery by determining whether
there is a market for the property. The closure may be determined to have substantial adverse impact if after advertising
for expressions of interest pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, no expressions of interest are received. No
expressions of interest to purchase the property signifies that public or private developers will not be able to provide
jobs and economic growth sufficient to provide timely recovery from closure without assistance. The second step
requires the Secretary concerned to make a determination that the base closure will have a substantial adverse impact
on the economy of the communities in the vicinity of the installation. In these cases, the base shall be offered to the
local redevelopment authority for conveyance without consideration and without recoupment (subject to paragraph
(f)(5) of this section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments,
because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed
to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases where the new property disposal process is not appropriate,
the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding with the disposition of the property.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) When real property is conveyed as described in paragraph (e) of this section, the Department of Defense shall generally
share in the division of future profits should the property be subsequently sold or leased. The division of profits
shall be based on net profits and the share shall generally favor the local redevelopment authority. There shall be
a 15-year time limit on the share of the profits. The government's portion of the receipts from the profit shall not
exceed the fair market value of the property at the time it was conveyed to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Properties conveyed under the authority of Pub.L. 103&hyph;160, section 2903, to local redevelopment authorities
under an economic development conveyance that are subsequently sold or leased shall be subject to recoupment (profit
sharing) by the Department of Defense, except as provided in paragraph (e)(6) of this section. In the absence of a determination
by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned that a different division of the net profits is appropriate
because of special circumstances, the net profits shall be shared on a basis of 60 percent to the local redevelopment
authority and 40 percent to the Department of Defense. The purpose of this recoupment policy is to allow the local redevelopment
authority to benefit from the success of its efforts and from value created from zoning. Eliminating the requirement
for initial consideration also frees the local redevelopment authority's income stream for use in funding infrastructure
improvements needed to develop the property and increase its value. Sharing the profits, when they occur, will provide
a return to the taxpayers for the property they originally paid for, without unduly burdening the community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The total recoupment by the Government shall not exceed the fair market value of the property (or the top end of the
range of values) calculated at the time of conveyance to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The standard excess profits covenant promulgated by the General Services Administration (GSA) at 41 CFR 101&hyph;47.4908
shall be used as a model deed provision to implement this recoupment policy, recognizing that the GSA provision will
require tailoring for each parcel. The following changes and additions are required:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The deed provision will express the profit sharing established under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, unless
explicitly modified by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The term of this deed provision in economic development conveyances will be 15 years unless released earlier
by the government upon satisfaction of the recoupment requirement. The disposing Military Department will provide
a statement, for use at any settlement, on the local redevelopment authority's compliance with the deed provision.
The Military Department will formally release the provision when the government has received its share of the sale
proceeds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The deed provision will forbid ``straw'' transactions (sales or leases to a cooperating party at a nominal price),
transactions at other than arm's length, and other devices designed to circumvent the Government's recovery of its
share of the net profits. The purpose of this clause of the deed provision is to provide a basis for the government to
intervene if it appears that a transaction may adversely affect its interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) In calculating the amount of any net profit from a sale or lease, the local redevelopment authority may include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Capital costs, as provided in 41 CFR 101&hyph;47.4908(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Direct and indirect costs related to the particular property and transaction that are otherwise allowable under
48 CFR part 31 including the allocable costs of operation of the local redevelopment authority with regard to that
property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The annual report required by the GSA provision will be deleted, and a clause requiring notification to the disposing
Military Department of sales or leases will be substituted. The notice of sale or lease will be accompanied by an accounting
or financial analysis indicating the net profit, if any, from a sale, or the estimated annual profit from a lease. The
accounting or financial analysis, and any other aspect of a transaction by the local redevelopment authority with
respect to property transferred under this part, is subject to Department of Defense audit.

revenues from a conveyance under this section when such settlement is requested by the redevelopment authority.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The provisions of this section may not be appropriate for some of the 1988 and 1991 base closures and realignments,
because these bases are so far along in the property disposal process that certain actions have been taken or agreed
to that are inconsistent with the new procedures. In cases where the new property disposal process is not appropriate,
the Secretary concerned shall request a waiver from the ASD(ES) before proceeding with the disposition of the property.

Leasing of real property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Leasing of real property is an effective way to quickly attract new jobs to replace those that have been lost by the
base closing. In the past, the requirement to lease at fair market value discouraged the creation of new jobs. The new
process of leasing, at less than fair market value, where appropriate, will provide new incentives for redevelopment
authorities and businesses alike to spur job creation and speed economic redevelopment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretaries of the Military Departments are authorized by Pub. L. 103&hyph;160, section 2906 to lease real
and personal property at closing or realigning bases for consideration of less than the estimated fair market value,
if the Secretary concerned determines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That a public interest will be served as a result of the lease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That securing the estimated fair market rental value from the lease is not compatible with such public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Military Departments shall determine the environmental suitability of property to be leased using the procedures
in the DoD policy entitled ``Procedures for Finding of Suitability to Lease (FOSL)'' contained in the Deputy Secretary
of Defense Memorandum,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 ``Fast Track Cleanup at Closing Installations'', September 9, 1993, and any amendments thereto. Regulatory consultation
(Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and State government) must be completed before entering into any leases,
as specified in the FOSL guidance and when approved, the Memorandum of Understanding between DoD and EPA will confirm
the FOSL process.

(4) The Military Departments are encouraged to redelegate leasing authority to the level that can best respond to
local redevelopment needs and still exercise prudent and consistent stewardship over these public assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Personal property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Personal property located on closing bases is often very useful to the redevelopment of the real property. This
section outlines procedures to allow transfer of personal property with the real property in many cases. It provides
for completing an inventory soon after the base is approved for closure, consulting with local officials, and a walkthrough
of the base. The community can then identify the personal property it wishes to retain in its redevelopment plan. The
Department of Defense will keep a great deal of the personal property at the base while the redevelopment plan is being
put together. Only valid exemptions will be made to this freeze, usually involving specific military requirements
or property which the base does not own. Emissions trading procedures will be issued separately and are not covered
by the part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each Military Department and Defense Agency, as appropriate, shall take an inventory of the personal property,
to include its condition, at closing or realigning bases as early in the closure process as possible. At realigning
bases, the inventory shall be limited to the personal property located on the real property to be disposed of by the
Military Department or Defense Agency. The purpose of the inventory is to identify personal property_any property
except land, fixed-in-place buildings, ships, and Federal records_that could enhance the reuse potential of real
property that may be conveyed to the local redevelopment authority for supporting the economic redevelopment of
the base. The exempted categories of personal property listed in paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall not be subject
to review by the community. The inventory must be completed by June 1, 1994, for 1988, 1991 and 1993 closures and realignments
or within 6 months after the date of approval of 1995 closures.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) The inventory shall be taken in consultation with local redevelopment authority officials. If no local redevelopment
authority exists, consultation shall be offered to the local government in whose jurisdiction the installation
is wholly located, or a local government agency or State government agency designated for the purpose of such consultation
by the chief executive officer of the State. Based on these consultations, the base commander is responsible for determining
the items or category of items potentially enhancing the reuse of the real property and needed to support the redevelopment
plan. When the inventory is completed, base personnel shall offer a ``walkthrough'' with representatives of the
local redevelopment authority so that they can see the type and condition of the property available for reuse. Disagreements
should be resolved within the chain-of-command, with final authority on resolving personal property issues resting
with the Secretary of the Military Department or Defense Agency Director responsible for the real property. This
authority may be further delegated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Military Departments should make every reasonable effort to assist affected communities in obtaining the
personal property needed to convert the bases into economically-viable enterprises. Personal property not subject
to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section shall remain at a closing or realigning base until one of the following
time periods expire (whichever comes first):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) One week after the date on which the redevelopment plan is submitted to the applicable Military Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date on which the local redevelopment authority notifies the applicable Military Department that a plan
will not be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Twenty-four months after the dates referred to in paragraph (h)(2) of this section which for 1988, 1991 and 1993
base closures and realignments is November 30, 1995, or 24 months after the date of approval of the 1995 closures and
realignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Ninety days before the date of the closure or realignment of the installation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Personal property may be removed without regard to these time periods upon approval of the base commander, or higher
authority within the Military Department, and after notice to the local redevelopment authority, if the property:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is required for the operation of a unit, function, component, weapon, or weapon system transferring to another
installation. A transferring unit or function may take with it any property needed to function properly as soon as
it arrives, provided that suitable replacement equipment will not be readily obtainable there and moving it is cost-effective.
In addition to this authority for the transferring unit or function to remove personal property, the major command
having jurisdiction over the installation (e.g., the Army's Forces Command or the Air Force's Air Combat Command),
or the major claimant having jurisdiction over the installation (e.g., the Navy's U.S. Atlantic Fleet) also may remove
property that is needed immediately and is indispensable to an organization under its jurisdiction at another installation
for carrying out the organization's primary mission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Is uniquely military in character, and is likely to have no civilian use (other than use for its material content
or as a source of commonly used components). Classified items; nuclear, biological, chemical items; weapons and
munitions; museum property or items of significant historic value that are maintained or displayed on loan; and similar
military items fit this exception.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Is not required for the reutilization or redevelopment of the installation (as jointly determined by the Military
Department concerned and the redevelopment authority).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Is stored at the installation for distribution (including spare parts or stock items). This exception includes
materials or parts used in a manufacturing or repair function but does not include maintenance spares for equipment
to be left in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Meets known requirements of an authorized program of another Federal Department or Agency for which expenditures
for similar property would be necessary, and is the subject of a written request received from the head of the Department
or Agency. In this context, ``expenditures'' means the Federal Department or Agency intends to obligate funds in
the current quarter or next six fiscal quarters. The Federal Department or Agency must pay packing, crating, handling,
and transportation charges associated with such transfers of personal property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Belongs to nonappropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI). NAFI property may be removed at the Military Departments'
discretion, because NAFI property belongs to the Service members collectively and is not government property. Therefore,
it may not be transferred to the local redevelopment authority under this section. Separate arrangements for communities
to purchase NAFI property are possible and may be negotiated with the Military Department concerned.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Personal property to be transferred to the local redevelopment authority in support of its redevelopment plan
is not subject to sections 202 and 203 of Public Law 81&hyph;152, ``Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act of 1949, as amended'' of June 30, 1949, 40 U.S.C. 483&hyph;484. If the real property is transferred without consideration,
the personal property shall also be transferred without consideration. If the real property is transferred at or
near estimated fair market value, the value of the personal property shall be included in the estimated fair market
value of the real property. If the property is conveyed separately from the real property, the value of the personal
property shall be that at which it is carried on the installation's property account or estimated fair market value
as agreed to between the parties at the time of transfer.

(7) In addition to the exemptions in paragraph (h)(5) of this section, the Military Department or Defense Agency is
authorized to substitute an item similar to one requested by the redevelopment authority. The substitute items may
be drawn from another installation or from the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service. It is the responsibility
of the Military Department or Defense Agency that owns the property to find a similar item that may be suitable as a substitute.
In this context, ``similar'' means the original and the proposed substitute item are designed and constructed for
the same specific purpose. However, before substituting another item for the one being requested, the base commander
shall consult with the redevelopment authority.

(8) Personal property that is not needed by a major command (or its subordinates), a Federal Agency, or a local redevelopment
authority (or a State or local jurisdiction in lieu of a local redevelopment authority) shall be transferred to a Defense
Reutilization and Marketing Office for processing in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act of 1949, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 483 et seq.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Facilities and equipment located on closing bases are often important to the eventual reuse. This section provides
procedures to protect their condition while the redevelopment plan is being put together. The level of maintenance
will be determined in consultation with the redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 2902 states that the Secretary may not reduce the level of maintenance and repair
of facilities or equipment at the installation below the minimum levels required to support the use of such facilities
or equipment for nonmilitary purposes, except when the Secretary of the Military Department concerned determines
that such reduction is in the National Security interest of the United States. This requirement remains in effect
until one of the time periods in paragraph (h)(4) of this section has expired.

(3) The initial minimum level of maintenance and repair to support non-military purposes shall be determined during
consultation between the Military Department and the redevelopment authority. This level and the property to which
it applies shall be reviewed with the local redevelopment authority when it presents its final development plan.
Where agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of the Military Department concerned shall determine the level
of maintenance required. In no case shall the level of maintenance and repair:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Exceed the standard at the time of approval of the closure or realignment.

(ii) Require any improvements to the property to include construction, alteration, or demolition, except that required
by environmental restoration.

(4) The negotiated minimum maintenance agreement must be tailored to the specific non-military uses, but shall include
the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Maintaining the facilities and equipment that are likely to be utilized in the near term at a level that shall prevent
undue deterioration and allow transfer to the local redevelopment authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Overview of the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Implementation of the Continued Health Care Benefit Program (CHCBP) was directed by Congress in section 4408 of the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993, Public Law 102&hyph;484, which amended title 10, United
States Code, by adding section 1078a. This law directed the implementation of a program of temporary continued health
benefits coverage for certain former beneficiaries of DoD, comparable to the health benefits provided for former
civilian employees of the Federal government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress also directed the program start by October 1, 1994, and replace the conversion health care programs authorized
in section 1086a and 1145(b) of title 10. Conversion health care is provided via a Department of Defense (DoD) contract
with Mutual of Omaha and is scheduled to end September 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status directs that the benefits offered by the CHCBP must be comparable to those offered to former civilian employees
of the Federal government. As is the case for those employees, the costs will be borne by the beneficiary who will pay
the entire premium charge. Additionally, the DoD is permitted to charge up to an additional ten percent of the premium
charge to cover administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4408(b), eligibility to enroll in the CHCBP includes members of the uniformed services who are discharged
or released (voluntarily or involuntarily as long as not under adverse conditions) and their dependents; certain
unremarried former spouses of a member or former member; and emancipated children.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health care coverage in the CHCBP is for a specific time period, which varies by the category of beneficiary. Coverage
periods are as follows: Former uniformed services members and their dependents_up to 18 months; unremarried former
spouses_up to 36 months; emancipated children (age 21 if not in college or up to age 23 if in college)_up to 36 months.
Eligible beneficiaries generally will have 60 days to elect coverage after they are notified of their opportunity
to enroll.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Defense considered three alternatives to implement this program: first, integration of the program
within the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) health care plans under arrangement with the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM); second, competitive procurement of a private insurer to administer this program; and
lastly, continued CHAMPUS-type coverage, paid for by the beneficiary, with a third party administrator collecting
the premiums and performing eligibility and verification functions. The first option was rejected based on the difficulties
of making the transition from a DoD administered benefit to an OPM program. The second option was not selected based
on the likelihood that an acquisition process involving a beneficiary group of such unpredictable size and characteristics
would not result in a vendor willing to underwrite this program. Contractors would be wary that health care costs would
exceed the capped premium. Thus, we propose to offer this program directly through the established mechanisms of
CHAMPUS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under this approach, beneficiaries will continue to make use of existing CHAMPUS rules and administrative structures
to receive their medical care and have medical claims paid. This feature will allow enrollees to make use of discounts
and reduced copayments and provider arrangements already part of CHAMPUS in some locations. As previously noted,
a third party administrator (TPA) will act as a central agent for the program. The functions of this TPA will be to: receive
applications for enrollment of beneficiaries; verify eligibility and approve enrollment; notify the Defense Enrollment
and Eligibility Reporting Systems (DEERS) of enrollment; collect premiums; and provide administrative services.
CHCBP eligibles will obtain information concerning the program and the application process and other TPA functions
at their local base transition office or through the nearest military treatment facility's (MTF) Health Benefits
Advisory (HBA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is expected that premium rates for this program will be comparable to the premium rates of a mid-range Health Maintenance
Organization (HMO) offered in the FEHBP. The Department of Defense has contracted with a private sector actuarial
firm to help develop premium rates. It is anticipated these rates will include individual and family premiums, but
will not be age/sex adjusted. (Similar to FEHBP premium schedules). Premium rates for fiscal year 1995 are currently
being calculated, however, it is expected that these quarterly rates will be in the range of $250 self and $625 for family.

II. Rulemaking Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires certain regulatory assessments for any ``significant regulatory action,'' defined
as one which would result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or have other substantial impacts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires that each Federal agency prepare, and make available for public comment,
a regulatory flexibility analysis when the agency issues a regulation which would have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is not a significant regulatory action under the provisions of Executive Order 12866, and it would not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule will impose additional information collection requirements on the public under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 USC 3501&hyph;3511), because beneficiaries will be required to enroll. Request for approval
and review has been submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a proposed rule. Public comments are invited. All comments will be considered. A discussion of the major issues
received by public comments will be included with issuance of the final rule, anticipated approximately 60 days after
the end of the comment period.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CHCBP is a premium based temporary health care coverage program that will be available to qualified beneficiaries
(set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section). Medical coverage under this program will mirror the benefits offered
via the basic CHAMPUS program. Premium costs for this coverage are payable by enrollees to a Third Party Administrator.
The CHCBP is not part of the CHAMPUS program. However, as set forth in this section, it functions under most of the rules
and procedures of CHAMPUS. Because the purpose of the CHCBP is to provide a continuation health care benefit for DoD
beneficiaries losing eligibility, it will be administered so that it appears, to the maximum extent possible, to
be part of CHAMPUS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993. The revisions concern a rule from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District
(SMAQMD). This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of
approving this rule is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements
of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rule controls VOC emissions from aerospace assembly
and coating operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of this revision into the California SIP under provisions
of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards
and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 4, 1993 at 58 FR 51591, EPA proposed to approve SMAQMD Rule 456, Aerospace Assembly and Component Coating
Operations, into the California SIP. Rule 456 was adopted by SMAQMD on February 23, 1993 and submitted by the California
Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on April 6, 1993. This rule was submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the
CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology
(RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act.
A detailed discussion of the background for the above rule and nonattainment area is provided in the proposed rule
cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the proposed rule cited
above. EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions
and evaluations has been provided at 58 FR 51591 and in a technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region
IX office (TSD for SMAQMD Rule 456 dated August 8, 1993).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 26, 1988, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control submitted a revision to
the Delaware State implementation plan (SIP) to achieve and maintain the national ambient air quality standards
(NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM&hyph;10). The revision consists of: (1) Regulation 1_``Definitions and Administrative
Principles''; (2) Regulation 3_``Ambient Air Quality Standards''; (3) Regulation 15_``Air Pollution Alert and
Emergency Plan''; and (4) Regulation 25_``Requirements for Preconstruction Review''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The April 26, 1988 submittal also contained revised cutpoints for the motor vehicle exhaust emissions testing program
in Delaware and a newly-adopted volatile organic compound (VOC) control regulation for equipment leaks at synthetic
organic chemical manufacturing industry (SOCMI) facilities. The former was addressed under a separate rulemaking
at 55 FR 3402. The latter is also being addressed under a separate rulemaking. This notice will address only that portion
of the State of Delaware's April 26, 1988 submittal pertaining to PM&hyph;10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 26, 1988 submittal is consistent with the SIP revision requirements for PM&hyph;10 Group III areas as detailed
in the July 1, 1987 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (52 FR 24672). The amended Delaware regulations are consistent with the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10, and specify:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;PM&hyph;10 as an indicator of particulate matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;exceedance levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of SIP Revision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10) (52 FR 24634). The PM&hyph;10 standards replace
the total suspended particulate (TSP) standards promulgated by EPA in 1971. Also on July 1, 1987, EPA promulgated
changes to the policies and regulations by which it will implement the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in 40 CFR parts 51 and 52
(52 FR 24672).

Using the classification criteria established at 52 FR 24672, EPA has preliminarily designated areas within each
State as Group I, II, or III based upon an area's probability of attaining the PM&hyph;10 standard. The July 1, 1987

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice requires State implementation plan (SIP) revisions for all classified Group I, II, and III areas and indicates
the SIP revision requirements for each classification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 7, 1987, the State of Delaware was classified at 52 FR 29383 as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Group III_The entire State of Delaware.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments) did not affect the requirements established for Group III areas. The

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires States to seek approval of SIP revisions as required under the preconstruction review program and to codify
other minor regulatory changes as needed. It is presumed that the existing Delaware SIP is adequate to demonstrate
attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in all Group III areas in the State. On April 26, 1988, the State
of Delaware responded to the July, 1, 1987

EPA Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated Delaware's SIP revision request and concluded the following: (1) The amended regulations conform

EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. These revisions to Delaware's regulations have been effective in the State
since March 29, 1988. This action will be effective June 6, 1994 unless, by May 6, 1994, notice is received that adverse
or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective
date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another
will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments
are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on June 6, 1994.

Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the four (4) regulations submitted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control as a revision to the Delaware SIP. EPA's review of this material indicates that it conforms to the requirements
of 40 CFR parts 51 and 52, and to the July 1, 1987 promulgation of NAAQS for PM&hyph;10 in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the Federally-approved State implementation plan for conformance
with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action
conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.

SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose
any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities
affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived
Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866, which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by June 6, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2)
of the Clean Air Act.)

evidence of carcinogenicity was observed based on a statistically significant increasing trend for benign liver
cell tumors in male rats and a statistically significant increasing trend for ovarian tubular adenomas in female
rats. A re-evaluation of the ovarian neoplasia data indicated that there was no statistically significant, dose-related,
trend in the incidence of ovarian tumors in female rats. This study is discussed further below.

 assay. A Dominant Lethal Study to further evaluate the mutagenic mechanism is due March 5, 1995 (2 years after the date
of the initial conditional registration of dimethenamid under the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide
Act [FIFRA]).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has concluded that the available data provide limited evidence of carcinogenicity for dimethenamid in
rats and has classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence
of carcinogenicity in animals) in accordance with Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in 1986 (51 FR 33992). Based on a review by the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of
the Office of Pesticide Programs, the Agency has determined that a quantitative risk assessment is not appropriate
for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The tumor response was primarily due to a significantly increasing trend for benign and/or malignant liver tumors
in males and due to a significantly increasing trend for ovarian tubular adenomas in female rats. A re-evaluation
of the ovarian neoplasia data indicated that there was not a statistically significant, dose-related, trend in the
incidence of ovarian tumors in female rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to mice at dose levels ranging from 30 to 3,000 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this evidence, EPA concludes that dimethenamid poses at most a negligible cancer risk to humans and that for
purposes of risk characterization the Reference Dose (RfD) approach should be used for quantification of human risk.
Residues of dimethenamid will not concentrate in processed soybean commodities and a food or feed additive regulation
is not required for dimethenamid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard risk assessment approach of using the RfD based on systemic toxicity was applied to dimethenamid. Using
a hundredfold safety factor and the NOEL of 5 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2&hyph;year
rat feeding study, the RfD is 0.05 mg/kg/day. The Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) from the established tolerances
is 0.000003 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 0.007 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population. The proposed use on
soybeans would contribute an additional 0.000068 mg/kg/day, raising the ARC to 0.000071 mg/kg bwt/day, or 0.14 percent
of the RfD. The exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population did not utilize a significantly greater
amount of the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tolerances have been previously established for dimethenamid in corn grain, corn fodder and corn forage. The metabolism
of dimethenamid in plants is adequately understood. There is no reasonable expectation of secondary residues occurring
in meat, milk and eggs from the tolerance associated with this petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead
time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide Analytical
Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide
enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Information Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C),
Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Office location
and telephone number: Room 1130A, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703&hyph;305&hyph;5937).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS amends its regulations to allow importers or brokers to file ``Fisheries Certificates of Origin,'' which are
required for importation of certain fish and fish products, using the U.S Customs Service's Automated Broker Interface
(ABI) system. The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate excess paperwork and minimize the reporting burden, while
maintaining an efficient, accurate system to monitor the importation of the regulated fish and fish products.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has implemented the use of the NOAA Form 370 ``Fisheries Certificate of Origin'' (FCO) to monitor the importation
of those fish and fish products specified by regulation to implement the Marine Mammal Protection Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;711)(MMPA),
the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;627, Title IX) (DPCIA), and the International
Dolphin Conservation Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. 102&hyph;523)(IDCA). These laws reflect the policy of the U.S. Government to ameliorate a worldwide environmental
crisis in which marine mammals and other marine life are killed by commercial fishing technology, such as large-scale
driftnets and purse seine nets deployed to encircle dolphins. The FCO provides the U.S. Customs Service (USCS) a tool
to monitor and deny entry of those fish products that are prohibited entry into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published a proposed rule, with a request for comments, on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 60829), in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to amend the regulations to allow importers or brokers to file the FCO using the USCS's Automated Broker Interface
(ABI). Filing with the ABI would allow electronic filing of importation documentation without submission of the
paper forms. There were no comments received on the proposed rule. The final rule is substantially identical to the
proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule advances USCS's long-range plan to automate the importation process with the goal of eliminating
unnecessary paperwork. NMFS has requested, and USCS has agreed, to incorporate the FCO into the ABI system. USCS has
agreed to collect the information and to make the information available to NMFS by electronic transfer. The ABI system
for the FCO will not be ready until the second quarter of 1994. Many details still need to be worked out before initiating
electronic filing of the FCO. Recognizing this, NMFS is structuring its regulations to accommodate both the existing
paper system and the future electronic filing of the FCO. To facilitate the conversion to electronic filing, the final
rule will permit electronic filing at any and all points of entry where the ABI system is or may become available. After
the ABI system is implemented for the FCO, importers will have the option to file electronically or submit the paper
FCO upon entry. If an importer is unable to participate in the electronic filing system, the paper FCO can still be used.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importers or their brokers will be required to maintain documentation to verify electronic entries for a period of
5 years after the entry. Any FCOs from foreign exporters, invoices, ``dolphin safe'' certification, and all other
required documents must be maintained by the broker or importer. NMFS enforcement officers are allowed access to
these documents, upon request, for routine inspections and when investigating alleged violations of the MMPA or
``dolphin safe'' labeling violations.

This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. chapter
35. The collections-of-information requirements found at &sect;216.24(e)(3) have been approved by the Office
of Management and Budget under control number 0648&hyph;0040. The public reporting burden for filing the Certificate
of Origin electronically is 24 minutes, and the recordkeeping requirement for maintaining the information is 5 minutes.
Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of the collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to: Director, Southwest Region, NMFS (See

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains EPA's final rule implementing the control of vehicle refueling emissions through the use
of vehicle-based systems. It applies to light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. The rule applies to all fuels
used by a vehicle, and includes special provisions for vehicles/fuels judged to be inherently low in refueling emissions.
For light-duty vehicles, the requirements begin in the 1998 model year, and phase in over three model years. In the
1998 model year, 40 percent of each manufacturer's light-duty vehicles must meet the requirements. This increases
to 80 percent in the 1999 model year and rises to 100 percent in model years 2000 and later. A special provision for phase-in
is also included for small volume manufacturers of light-duty vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This requirement also applies to light-duty trucks. For light-duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 0&hyph;6000
lbs, the requirement begins in model year 2001 and phases-in over three model years at the same rate as applied to light-duty
vehicles. For light-duty trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6001&hyph;8500 lbs, the requirement commences
in model year 2004 and phases-in over three model years at the same rate as light-duty vehicles. The rule does not apply
to heavy-duty vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also establishes certification requirements covering test procedures for integrated and non-integrated
control system designs, a refueling emission standard of 0.20 g/gallon and other related certification requirements
and provisions. Finally, the rule contains enforcement provisions related to liability, Selective Enforcement
Auditing and nonconformance penalties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 19, 1987, EPA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the control of vehicle refueling emissions (52 FR 31162). The proposal
described the need for these controls as well as the conclusions of an EPA study of gasoline marketing emissions comparing
the relative merits of the two available control technologies: Systems incorporated into the gasoline dispensing
pump system design (known as Stage II vapor recovery) and systems incorporated into the design of the vehicle (known
as onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR)) (see Public Docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07). Based on this study, along with
EPA's analysis and response to public comments published in documents separate from the NPRM (Evaluation of Air Pollution
Regulatory Strategies for Gasoline Marketing Industry_Response to Public Comments (II&hyph;A&hyph;20), Draft
Regulatory Impact Analysis: Proposed Refueling Emission Regulations for Gasoline-Fueled Motor Vehicles, Vols.
I and II) (II&hyph;A&hyph;18, 19), and technical support documents related to ORVR test procedure (II&hyph;A&hyph;08)
and ORVR vehicle safety (II&hyph;A&hyph;17), EPA proposed to require refueling emission control through ORVR systems.
The above mentioned studies are available in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11. All future references of this nature
can be found at the cited location in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11 unless otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the NPRM, EPA held a public hearing in October 1987, followed by an extensive public
comment period which closed in February 1988. Comments were analyzed by EPA and key issues were assessed. As a result,
EPA determined that the final rulemaking should be delayed pending the resolution of safety concerns expressed by
both the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (part of the Department of Transportation (DoT))
and a number of the commenters. The final rule was further delayed when it became evident that Congress would address
issues concerning refueling controls in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 Amendments revised section 202(a)(6) of the CAA to read as follows:

Within 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Administrator shall, after
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicle-based (`onboard') systems for
the control of vehicle refueling emissions, promulgate standards under this section requiring that new light-duty
vehicles manufactured beginning in the fourth model year after the model year in which the standards are promulgated
and thereafter shall be equipped with such systems.

Subsequent to the enactment of the CAAA, EPA continued its consultation with DOT/NHTSA related to the potential safety
concerns regarding the implementation of vehicle-based refueling emission controls. In July 1991, NHTSA completed
an updated safety study entitled ``An Assessment of the Safety on Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery Systems''. On
September 3, 1991, EPA published an additional 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (56 FR 43682) releasing the NHTSA report for public review and seeking further comment on key issues involved
with ORVR controls, most notably on circumstances that had changed since the publication of the NPRM. The notice also
described and sought comment on a document entitled ``Summary of Changed Circumstances'', which discussed statutory
changes, technology development, and potential modifications to the refueling test procedure.

EPA held a public hearing on September 26 and 27, 1991, and public comments were received for 30 days thereafter. After
reviewing these comments, EPA continued its consultation with NHTSA. Based on the outcome of the consultation, EPA
determined that ORVR controls should not be required at that time. The Agency took this step because it concluded,
after consultation with NHTSA and after considering the conclusions of NHTSA's safety study, that ORVR controls
posed ``unreasonable'' safety risks relative to Stage II systems. A

 notice detailing the decision and the supporting rationale was published on April 15, 1992 (57 FR 13220). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's action was challenged by representatives of the petroleum refining, gasoline marketing, environmental and
consumer auto safety communities. They argued that section 202(a)(6) of the CAA created a non-discretionary duty
to promulgate ORVR standards for LDVs. The court agreed, holding that EPA had no choice but to promulgate such standards,
and that the entire safety analysis in the April 15, 1992 notice was flawed because of the comparison with Stage II technology,
a comparison not allowed by the text of the statute.

. at 261, 270. The court set aside the April 15, 1992 Agency action, and ordered EPA to promulgate regulations requiring
vehicle-based refueling controls on LDVs in accordance with the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners further moved the court for an order requiring EPA to issue ORVR requirements by a particular date.
Before the court ruled, EPA and the petitioners entered into a settlement agreement whereby the Agency agreed to promulgate
such rules by January 22, 1994 (58 FR 33813, June 21, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the court's decision, EPA published two

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices (May 27, 1993, 58 FR 30731 and June 17, 1993, 58 FR 33418) seeking public comment on the key issues that had changed
since the last public comment period. EPA also held a public hearing on these issues on July 22, 1993, and solicited
comments for 30 days thereafter. EPA has analyzed these additional comments, and has revised its proposed regulations
accordingly. To support this rule, two key documents, a Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and a Summary and Analysis
of Comments have been completed and are available for review in the public docket.

The remainder of the document is divided into sections. Section II describes the various aspects of the rule as listed
in the Table of Contents above, and provides rationale for the approaches being implemented. Section III describes
the long and extended public participation in the rulemaking process and previous study. Section IV summarizes the
Regulatory Impact Analysis. Finally, sections V through X describe various aspects of the rule with regard to compliance
with various administrative requirements such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 202(a)(6) of the Act mandates that EPA promulgate requirements for new light-duty vehicles (LDVs) to be equipped
with ORVR systems. In the August 1987 NPRM, EPA proposed that ORVR requirements apply to LDVs and, in this rule, is finalizing
that LDV portion of the original NPRM, consistent with the statutory requirements. The model year, phase-in, certification
and other requirements for LDVs are discussed in sections B through F, below.

2. Extension of the ORVR Requirement to LDTs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the authority provided in Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is applying the ORVR requirement
to light-duty trucks (LDTs). EPA is finalizing portions of that proposal in today's rules. Each manufacturer's LDTs
will have to meet the refueling emission requirements under the phase-in schedule and compliance program for trucks
described in the Implementation section below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In reaching this decision, EPA has conducted a detailed analysis of the need for and desirability of extending the
requirement beyond the LDV class. The analysis is detailed in the supporting Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) available
in the public docket. The key points are summarized below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the rule affects pollutants which ``cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated
to endanger public health or welfare'' (Section 202(a)(1)). Hydrocarbons, as ozone precursors, have long been an
essential object of emission control strategies (both vehicles and non-vehicles). Ambient ozone is an irritant
that adversely affects pulmonary membranes, lung tissues, and lung functions, and is also associated with adverse
ecological effects. Refueling emissions also contain benzene, a Group A human carcinogen. The gasoline vapors themselves
also adversely affect public health and welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, and perhaps most compelling, is the large amount of refueling emissions which arise from these LDTs. In 1990,
trucks represented about 33 percent of the gasoline used by highway motor vehicles. Using American Automobile Manufacturers
Association (AAMA) figures, retail truck sales have increased at a compound annual rate of 4&hyph;5 percent over
the past ten years, and this growth is projected to continue well into the next century. This increase in sales and market
fraction has led to an increase in the gasoline used by trucks. The fraction of gasoline used by LDTs is projected to
increase to 37 percent by 2000 and continue at that level or higher in the future. Thus, the percentage of the refueling
emissions inventory attributable to LDTs is large and is expected to increase in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another way to look at the magnitude of the emissions from LDTs is the equivalent gram per mile (g/mi) emission rate
attributable to their uncontrolled refueling emissions. As shown in the RIA, taking into account Phase II RVP control
and the RVP effects of reformulated gasoline, the nationwide uncontrolled refueling emission rate during the ozone
season for LDTs is about 0.22 g/mi. These are large emission rates in contrast to those controlled by other strategies
being implemented under the 1990 CAAA and being considered by the states in their State Implementation Plans. A good
example is the Clean-Fuel Fleet requirements under section 246 of the CAA and the Low Emission Vehicle program being
implemented in California and perhaps in other states. In these cases the equivalent emission reductions are in the
range of 0.12 to 0.18 g/mile. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, EPA believes that ORVR controls are technologically feasible for LDTs. Reports and other materials submitted
to the docket over the past several years as well as comments by the regulated industry indicate that prototype ORVR
systems have been installed on a number of passenger cars and light trucks (IV&hyph;A&hyph;06, IV&hyph;D&hyph;682,
680, 682, 685, 688, 864, 701, 712, 718, 719, 720, 721, IV&hyph;E&hyph;50, 73). As is now the case with evaporative control
systems, we anticipate that the control technology used for LDT ORVR systems will be very similar to that applied to
LDVs. Although there are some differences between LDV and LDT fuel systems (e.g., tank size in some larger LDTs), the
general fuel system concepts, designs, and configurations are very similar. In addition, vehicles in both classes
must meet the recently promulgated enhanced evaporative emission control requirements beginning in the 1996 model
year. As with LDVs, EPA anticipates that the same evaporative emission control technology can be applied to control
refueling emissions in LDTs. To ensure that the enhanced evaporative control system canister and purge system can
be applied to ORVR controls, EPA is applying the same refueling emission test procedure approach to LDTs as is being
applied to LDVs. The only significant design difference will be the need for some form of a fillneck seal. However,
with the anticipated liquid seal approach this requires at most a minor fillneck modification and does not involve
new hardware. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there are vehicle-to-vehicle differences in fuel system designs, these affect both the evaporative and refueling
emission rates for a given vehicle/fuel system design. To EPA's knowledge there is nothing unique about the design
or function of LDT fuel systems relative to LDVs which would suggest that the test procedure approach being applied
to LDVs would not be equally effective for LDTs in accomplishing the goal of allowing the widespread use of integrated
enhanced evaporative/refueling emission control systems. Although uncertainty has been expressed, no commenter
provided data or even a substantiated argument to support the view that the test procedure modifications would not
be equally effective in facilitating LDT use of integrated enhanced evaporative/refueling control systems. In
fact, testing conducted by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC&hyph;APRAC Project VE&hyph;6) (IV&hyph;D&hyph;565)
and EPA (II&hyph;A&hyph;06) indicate no significant difference between LDV and LDT uncontrolled refueling emission
rates. As is the case for LDVs, the refueling test procedure approach described above should allow the widespread
use of integrated refueling/evaporative control systems for LDTs. Thus, since there is no problem with applying
enhanced evaporative control systems to LDTs, there should be no problem with integrated evaporative/ refueling
control systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefits of applying the ORVR requirements to LDTs exceed the costs of the requirement. Since EPA believes, and
the manufacturers' comments indicate, that most vehicles will use an integrated evaporative/refueling control
system, the incremental costs of LDT ORVR controls are relatively small. As detailed in the RIA, EPA's cost is comprised
of added hardware (mostly an improved vent/rollover valve and larger diameter vapor line) and short term development
costs (for emissions and safety certification, facility modification hardware/tooling modifications, and systems
engineering) minus the fuel recovery credit. The size of the fuel recovery credit depends on the amount of vapor captured.
This in turn depends on the fuel used, the emissions rate (g/gal), and the presence or absence of Stage II vapor recovery.
Taking all of these factors into account, and assuming Stage II controls in most of the ozone NAAs, the cost estimate
for LDTs/HDVs are shown below in Table 1.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was discussed above, LDTs represent over 33 percent of the nation's gasoline consumption. With the test procedure
and control system approach mentioned above, EPA expects that the in-use control efficiency of LDT ORVR systems will
exceed 95 percent. Incremental to Stage II controls, LDT ORVR controls would provide a nationwide average annual
emission reduction of 115,000 tons between 1998 and 2020. Reductions in NAAs with Stage II controls are large as well.
With no Stage II phase-out, the average annual emission reduction in the NAAs is 31,000 tons. If Stage II is phased out
when ORVR is in widespread use (2010), the average annual emission reduction in the NAAs attributable to LDT controls
increases to 68,000 tons. These incremental reductions in NAAs are large relative to the other control options available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is discussed below, reductions in refueling emissions have value in all areas of the country. However, the main
focus of the ORVR requirement is to provide ozone NAAs additional reductions to assist them in complying or maintaining
compliance with the ozone standard. Thus, the important areas to consider are those which are not now in compliance
with the ozone standard. At present there are 54 marginal or worse ozone NA areas, which represent about 54.9 percent
of the nationwide highway gasoline consumption. Of these 54 areas, about 43 now have, or are expected to have, Stage
II vapor recovery systems in place. Since ORVR controls are required on all LDVs, and Stage II vapor recovery is (or
will be) in place in most moderate or worse ozone NAAs, the key comparison to be made is (1) retaining Stage II controls
in the moderate or worse ozone NAAs solely for the purpose of controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions, versus (2)
requiring ORVR controls for LDTs and possibly HDVs, assuming the Stage II control that is or will be in place. This comparison
provides a worst case perspective on the LDT/HDV cost effectiveness, since benefits outside NAAs are ignored and
planned Stage II is assumed to continue after the ORVR requirement is promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is described in the RIA, EPA has conducted the analysis for both the Stage II retention and ORVR options. The cost
effectiveness of retaining Stage II solely for the purpose of controlling LDT/HDV refueling emissions is about $3400
per ton. The cost effectiveness of the LDT ORVR controls incremental to the Stage II now in place is about $200 per ton
if Stage II is phased out when ORVR control is in widespread use (2010) and only about $700 per ton if Stage II is never
phased out. Under either scenario the cost effectiveness of the ORVR option is attractive. Thus, even with the Stage
II controls, it is more cost effective to require ORVR controls on LDTs than to retain Stage II solely for controlling
LDT/HDV refueling emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the VOC emission reduction benefits cited above, LDT ORVR controls have other benefits. These benefits
have not been considered in the calculations above, but would further enhance the attractiveness of LDT ORVR. LDT
ORVR controls would result in an average annual fuel savings equivalent to about 31 million gallons of gasoline per
year between the period 1998 and 2020 assuming no Stage II phase-out, and about 43 million gallons per year if Stage
II is phased out. In addition, there will be health benefits as a result of reductions in air toxic emissions. Best estimates
are the avoidance of 2&hyph;3 cancer incidences per year as a result of lower refueling benzene emissions. Additional
cancer avoidances are possible depending on the assumption regarding the toxicological impact of the remainder
of the constituents of the gasoline vapor. Reductions in potential non-cancer health effects and welfare benefits
such as reduced crop and material damage due to ozone would occur as well.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In summary, EPA has decided to implement ORVR controls for LDTs for several reasons: Their contribution to the VOC
inventory is significant and there is a need for additional VOC reductions to address air quality concerns, the control
is technologically feasible and inexpensive, there are additional valuable benefits, and, as discussed in the RIA,
the cost effectiveness is very attractive, especially when compared to other programs being implemented and under
consideration. The analysis shows that the cost effectiveness of implementing ORVR controls for LDTs is superior
to retaining Stage II controls for the same purpose. The overall benefit to cost ratio for LDT ORVR is about 1.5. If the
application of ORVR controls to LDVs and LDTs allows phaseout of Stage II controls in the future, the cost savings attributable
to Stage II operations/ maintenance which would no longer occur would make the average annual costs of ORVR controls
negative (an average annual savings of over $40 million). Based on the cost effectiveness analysis and benefit-cost
ratio, one could also justify implementing LDT ORVR controls incremental to Stage II controls. However, the long-term
retention of Stage II would seem problematic since it would be needed only for heavy-duty vehicles.

3. Heavy Duty Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the NPRM, EPA proposed to require ORVR controls for all HDVs. However, as discussed below, this requirement is not
being finalized in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information available to EPA indicates that an HDV ORVR system would be conceptually similar to those applied LDVs
and LDTs and the initial costs should be relatively small. However, motor vehicle manufacturers have argued that
the design and production of ORVR systems for HDVs would be considerably more difficult than for LDVs and LDTs. Commenters
have maintained that the technological step from light-duty technology is greatest with regard to HDVs which have
the largest fuel tanks and different fuel/vapor system component designs and configurations than many smaller LDTs.
Comments regarding incomplete HDVs expressed concern that secondary manufacturers would improperly modify or
incorrectly complete the vehicle fuel system (which is usually not fully installed for incomplete HDVs) and perhaps
affect the proper function of the manufacturer-provided ORVR system. Concern was also expressed that secondary
manufacturers might not have the expertise to correctly install the ORVR systems in all cases. In each case the primary
manufacturer may have legal liability for potential problems. It is also worth noting that many HDVs are also produced
by the primary manufacturer as an incomplete HDVs, perhaps compounding the concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes the manufacturers' strong concerns about ORVR implementation issues that are unique to HDVs, and
agrees that in many cases the application of ORVR controls to HDVs would be more difficult than for LDTs. Oftentimes
the fuel and vapor control systems are differently configured than those on LDTs and the fuel tanks are larger and of
different design. The large number of commercial applications for HDVs leads to a larger number of unique body/chassis
designs (e.g., 12 passenger vans, crew cabs, long bed pick-ups, dual wheel axle trucks) and thus a larger number of
different fuel system configurations. Another significant difference is that the engine in the HDV would be certified
separate from the ORVR system and thus there are additional challenges in matching the canister purge provided by
the engine with the needs of each ORVR system. The manufacturers' comments discussed above lay out the special concerns
for incomplete HDVs, including potential legal liabilities for the primary manufacturer. Finally, it should be
noted that unlike LDVs and LDTs EPA is not aware of any prototype ORVR-equipped HDVs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these concerns, the effort needed to implement LDV and LDT ORVR systems, the relatively small number of gasoline-fueled
HDVs, and the fact that the application of ORVR standards to HDVs is discretionary, EPA is not finalizing the portion
of the NPRM which applies to HDVs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Even without implementing HDV ORVR requirements at this time, the ORVR program still provides significant benefits.
When viewed as a percentage of sales, ORVR still applies to 91 percent of all gasoline-fueled trucks and 97 percent
of all gasoline-fueled vehicles. Similarly, control is still achieved over 86 percent of all gasoline-fueled truck
refueling emissions and 94 percent of all gasoline vehicle refueling emissions. Thus, EPA's final decision that
ORVR requirements are not required for these vehicles does not significantly reduce the effectiveness of the ORVR
program.

4. Applicability to California Vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As discussed further in the summary and analysis of comments, today's final rule implements a federal standard applicable
to all vehicles sold in the United States. Based on the language in section 202(a)(6) of the Act, EPA considers refueling
emissions control to be an evaporative standard. Although California has motor vehicle standards in place for model
year 1998 and beyond, including evaporative emission standards, to date EPA has issued no section 209(b) waivers
which consider a federal ORVR refueling program when evaluating the protectiveness, in the aggregate, of those standards.
However, EPA interprets section 209(b)(3) to provide that once a section 209(b) waiver is granted, compliance with
the state program is deemed compliance with the federal program standards. (See 42 FR 3193, January 17, 1977). To the
extent that a new federal standard is established subsequent to a waiver, such standard will be considered in a waiver
reconsideration or future waiver request consideration. EPA is making no finding at this time how stringency, in
the ORVR context, may be considered in a waiver proceeding, should one occur. (It should be noted that EPA in this notice
is restating its consistent interpretation for the convenience of rulemaking participants, and does not intend
to reopen for reconsideration the issue of the effect of existing section 209(b) waivers on post-waiver regulations.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) staff has held one workshop to discuss the proper application of refueling
control (November 2, 1993). CARB is considering three courses of action: adopting the federal ORVR rule, adopting
a California-specific ORVR rule, test, or standard, or maintaining that California's current motor vehicle program,
taken in the aggregate, is at least as stringent as the federal program notwithstanding the lack of ORVR controls.
If California submits a waiver request for its evaporative emission control program applicable to model year 1998
or thereafter, which does not include federal ORVR requirements, EPA will decide at that time whether California's
motor vehicle program is at least as protective as the federal program.

5. Fuels Covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the September 1991 and May 1993 notices, EPA specifically solicited comments on applying the ORVR requirements
to highway motor vehicles powered by fuels other than gasoline. Consistent with EPA policy on fuel neutrality and
establishing a consistent set of requirements for all fuels, today's rule requires that LDVs and LDTs operating on
any fuels be capable of meeting the refueling emission standard described below. It applies to vehicles certified
under both 40 CFR part 86 and 40 CFR part 88. Although many commenters stated that the refueling standard should not
apply to vehicles operating on diesel fuels, the section 202(a)(6) requirement by its terms applies to all LDVs regardless
of the type of fuel used. (In contrast, section 202(k) requires evaporative emission controls only for ``gasoline-fueled
motor vehicles''.) However, EPA has attempted to tailor the refueling emission certification requirements to the
fuel used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of vehicles capable of operating on gasoline, alcohol, or gasoline/alcohol blends must show that
these vehicles comply when refueled with such fuels through testing as described later in this preamble. This requirement
applies to dedicated neat alcohol fuel vehicles and vehicles using alcohol blends. Bi-fuel or dual-fuel vehicles
must meet the requirements on both fuels. Flexible-fueled vehicles must meet the requirements on all fuel combinations.
At the present time the only alcohol fuel affected is methanol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a waiver of emission testing requirements is available for those vehicles/fuels which are considered to
be inherently low in refueling emissions. EPA believes that a general engineering evaluation approach is acceptable
for diesel vehicles and diesel fuels for several reasons. Diesel fuel today has a Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of less
than one pound per square inch (psi) (7 kPa) and diesel engines today do not raise the temperature of fuel in their tanks
substantially more than do gasoline engines (less than 130 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F under most conditions). For these reasons, the vapor space over the fuel in diesel tanks has a very low concentration
of fuel vapor compared to that in gasoline tanks and thus displacement refueling emissions are low. EPA thus expects
diesel fuel vehicles to meet the refueling emission standard without a control system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under this approach, the vehicle manufacturer's certification application must include a statement that there
is nothing about the vehicle, its fuel system, or fuel that is counter to EPA's assessment as discussed above, and the
manufacturer's certification that the vehicle meets the refueling emission standard (even without a control system).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA retains the opportunity to test vehicles to ensure that they comply with the emission standard during certification
confirmatory testing, Selective Enforcement Audits, and in-use testing. EPA also retains the right to retract the
engineering evaluation option for diesel vehicles if the RVP of in-use diesel fuel increases or is expected to increase
beyond 1 psi (7 kPa) or a significant increase in fuel tank temperatures is expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since exhaust and evaporative emission requirements now exist for all new methanol-fueled (neat and blend) vehicles,
these shall be required to comply with the ORVR standards under the same phase-in schedule as gasoline-fueled vehicles.
EPA expects that these vehicles will use a technology similar to that used to comply with the evaporative emission
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The refueling control requirement will be applied to other dedicated, dual-fuel, bi-fuel, and flexible-fuel vehicles
using other fuels (e.g., dedicated and hybrid electric vehicles, ethanol and ethanol blends, compressed and liquid
natural gas, liquified petroleum gas) as regulations covering these fuels are implemented in the future. Lead time,
safety, and other factors will be considered in the course of these actions. Full testing and engineering evaluation
certification options will be considered.

1. Leadtime, Effective Model Year and Phase-in Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Section 202(a)(6) of the Act specifies a four model year lead time before ORVR requirements are to become effective
for LDVs (``vehicles manufactured beginning in the fourth model year after the model year in which the standards are
promulgated''). After this four-year lead time, a three-year phase-in period begins, during which 40 percent, 80
percent, and 100 percent, respectively, of each manufacturer's sales of new LDVs will need to meet the ORVR requirements.
Today's action is occurring early in the 1994 model year. Thus, ORVR requirements for LDVs will become effective with
the 1998 model year. At least 40 percent of each manufacturer's LDV sales will need to meet ORVR requirements in model
year 1998, 80 percent for model year 1999, and 100 percent for model years 2000 and later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the application of ORVR requirements to LDTs is under the general authority in section 202(a)(1), the specific
lead time and phase-in requirements of section 202(a)(6) do not automatically apply. Rather, the standard ``shall
take effect after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the
requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance `` (Section 202(a)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed elsewhere in this preamble, EPA believes that the nature of ORVR technology for LDTs will be very similar
to that for LDVs and that the cost of controls, incremental to the cost of enhanced evaporative emission controls,
is minimal. EPA also does not believe that ORVR controls for LDTs present different safety issues than canisters on
LDVs where there is now general consensus that there are no unreasonable risks. We therefore believe that the lead
time required for developing these systems could be similar regardless of vehicle class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While several commenters requested a delay in the LDT ORVR requirement, commenters did not indicate that it was not
technically feasible to develop ORVR controls for LDTs during this timeframe. However, comments from the vehicle
manufacturers did express a concern that resource and facility constraints would make simultaneous development
of ORVR systems for LDVs and all trucks problematic. They have also indicated that design, development and some in-use
experience with ORVR systems on passenger cars would be helpful in the design of LDT systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded that the resource and facility concerns expressed by the manufacturers and the desirability for
in-use experience with ORVR systems can be balanced against the need for emission reductions by beginning the phase-in
of ORVR requirements for LDTs after the program for LDVs has been fully implemented. In the mid-to-late 1990's gasoline-powered
vehicle manufacturers will need to respond to new evaporative emission requirements, cold CO exhaust emission standards,
and California and Clean Fuel Fleet exhaust emission standards among others. Most of these requirements apply to
all three vehicle classes and entail several hundred vehicle/engine families. Under the statutory requirement
the manufacturers will need to comply with LDV ORVR requirements in the same timeframe. And while complying with the
enhanced evaporative and ORVR requirements simultaneously using an integrated control system reduces the burden
relative to separate approaches for LDTs, a delay for LDTs is not unreasonable given the already existing requirements.
This trade-off is also acceptable in the short-term since Stage II refueling controls are or will be in place in many
ozone NAAs. However, for the reasons discussed above, EPA believes that ORVR controls are the preferred long term
approach for control of refueling emissions from LDTs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Therefore, the requirements promulgated today for LDTs will be implemented in two stages. The first stage will cover
LDTs with a GVWR of 6,000 or less (LLDT), the second will cover LDTs with a GVWR of 6,001 to 8,500 lbs GVWR (HLDT). LLDTs
represent about 70 percent of LDT sales. HLDTs represent the remaining 30 percent. For LLDTs, the ORVR requirement
will begin implementation in the 2001 model year and will phase in over three model years according to the same percentages
as LDVs. For HLDTs, the ORVR requirement will begin implementation in the 2004 model year and will phase in over three
model years according to the same percentages as LDVs (40/80/100). This schedule will permit the development and
application of cost-effective, economically achievable technology, as required by section 202(a)(2) and will
still allow consideration of the Stage II phaseout provisions of section 202(a)(6) of the CAA in the long term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions of 40 CFR 86.085&hyph;1(b) permit manufacturers to certify HDVs with a GVWR of 8,501&hyph;10,000 lbs
GVWR as LDTs. This option will remain in effect for refueling controls. HDVs certified under this option would be treated
as HLDTs for purposes leadtime, phase-in and sales compliance determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA does not view the provisions of section 202(a)(3) as applying to refueling controls, as that provision was probably
intended to apply only to exhaust emission standards, as did its predecessor provision. However, even if it did apply,
this section would provide for at least four years of leadtime. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is allowing this much leadtime for HLDTs anyway, designating section 202(a)(2) or 202(a)(3) as authority for
HDV leadtime has no practical significance here.

2. Small Volume Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Today's rule includes a short-term provision for small volume light-duty vehicle manufacturers. Several small
volume manufacturers commented that, as a practical matter, they cannot phase in their compliance due to their small
size and limited product lines. Small volume manufacturers also claimed that they sometimes rely on control technology
developed by larger manufacturers to develop their compliance strategies, and this would not be possible if they
must comply at essentially the 100 percent of sales level before the larger manufacturers. R&amp;D cost concerns
were cited as obstacles as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that these comments state valid concerns. As is described in three recent Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices, EPA has allowed small volume manufacturers to delay compliance to the last model year of the phase-in: in
the Tier 1 exhaust emission standard rule (June 5, 1991, 56 FR 25724), the cold CO exhaust emissions rule (July 17, 1992,
57 FR 31888), and the enhanced evaporative emission standards rule (March 24, 1993, 58 FR 16003), and has decided to
allow the same accommodation for the ORVR requirement for light-duty vehicles. This provision is included, not only
for the reasons raised by the manufacturers, but also because it would be inconsistent to face ORVR compliance before
evaporative emission compliance when the comments indicate that most manufacturers plan to use integrated refueling/evaporative
control systems and these are desirable for both cost and safety reasons. In addition, requiring phased compliance
for these manufacturers effectively denies them the opportunity Congress intended to phase in the control technology.

in 40 CFR part 86, may delay compliance to model year 2000 (i.e., the third model year of the phase-in), but must comply
with 100 percent of sales in that and subsequent model years. Because of the additional leadtime EPA is affording to
LDTs, the Agency is not implementing this small-volume manufacturer provision for these vehicles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was discussed in the May 1993 notice, vehicles meeting the refueling emission standard because they are inherently
low in refueling vapor emissions (those certified without a control system using the engineering evaluation option),
and thus are waived from testing, cannot be counted in either the vehicles complying or base sales figures in determining
compliance with the sales requirements of the statute. Compliance for these vehicles is to be calculated separately.

C. Refueling Emission Test Procedures and Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule includes test procedures for the measurement of refueling emissions and a corresponding emissions
standard by which to judge the adequacy of ORVR control system designs. The test procedures accommodate integrated
system designs, which control both refueling and evaporative emissions with a common vapor storage unit, as well
as non-integrated system designs, which do not share vapor storage units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test procedures for these two types of control systems, although different in some ways (explained below), involve
the same basic steps: Load the storage canister with hydrocarbon vapor, drive the vehicle to provide opportunity
for canister purge, and refuel the vehicle while measuring emissions (see Figures 1 and 2). The first two steps together
are referred to as the preconditioning phase and are discussed in detail further on in this section.

1. Refueling Emissions Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedure for the refueling step is common to both integrated and non-integrated systems. It involves disconnecting
the vapor line from the fuel tank to the canister, draining the fuel tank, refueling with test fuel to 10 percent of the
nominal tank capacity, soaking the vehicle for 6 to 24 hours at 80

minute (15.1 to 37.9 liters per minute) and is terminated at the first automatic shutoff that occurs after a quantity
of fuel has been pumped equal to at least 85 percent of the nominal tank capacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the key issues raised in the July 1993 hearing and the subsequent comment period concerned the test temperature
specifications for the dispensed fuel and the residual in-tank fuel, both of which have a major impact on the refueling
vapor generation and therefore on ORVR system designs. Hearing participants discussed the merits of setting the
test dispensed fuel temperature at 67 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (19.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

&cir;F (26.7 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received on both sides of this issue. The manufacturers supported the test temperature specifications
discussed at the July 1993 hearing. They believed these specifications would enable the canisters planned for meeting
the enhanced evaporative emission requirements to also capture refueling emissions and would facilitate the use
of liquid seals as an option to mechanical seals in the fillneck. Manufacturers commented that this would provide
much needed design flexibility and alleviate their safety concerns. The American Petroleum Institute (API) and
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) supported the 81
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;84 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F dispensed temperature range proposed earlier. They expressed concern that 67 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is not representative of actual dispensed fuel temperatures on high ozone days and therefore might lead to
a situation where the test procedure does not adequately represent in-use conditions with the result that refueling
emissions are controlled inadequately in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's goal in establishing test parameters is to ensure that the combination of test conditions results in designs
that will achieve a very high level of control in use. Therefore, the representativeness of any one test parameter,
such as dispensed fuel temperature, is of less concern than the net effect of the total test. For example, in-use RVPs
in many parts of the nation during the summer months are lower than that specified in the test. What is important is the
combined effects of the key parameters during an in-use refueling event. EPA's analysis of in-use effectiveness
described in the Regulatory Impact Analysis and Summary and Analysis of Comments indicates that these test conditions
will yield designs that achieve in-use control in excess of 95 percent during the ozone season in the NAAs (even assuming
the accuracy of data showing that one region of the country has dispensed fuel temperatures within or exceeding the
81
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;84 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F range, a potentially questionable assumption, as explained in the next paragraph). Based on this analysis
and the manufacturers' comments, EPA has concluded that the test specifications being finalized in this action are
appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dispensed gasoline temperature parameter discussed in the NPRM was derived using limited survey information
on in-use refueling events. The 81
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;&hyph;84 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F dispensed temperature value in the NPRM was driven by refueling events in the Southeastern U.S. These dispensed
fuel temperature values are seven or more degrees higher than any other region of the country. There is no obvious technical
reason why the Southeastern U.S. values were so much higher than those found in other regions of the country. Thus,
there is some possibility that they may be unrepresentative, in which case the &blank;&blank;&blank;&blank; 67

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F temperature used in the refueling test is even more representative. (EPA is not completely disavowing the
Southeastern U.S dispensed fuel data, since it is the only data available to EPA at this time. The Summary and Analysis
of Comments contains an analysis of the sensitivity of the in-use effectiveness of the ORVR requirement to this dispensed
temperature value.)

2. Integrated System Preconditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nature of integrated systems allows for a corresponding integration of ORVR and evaporative emission preconditioning
procedures. This integration is desirable because of potential test resource savings. A major revision of the evaporative
emission test procedure was completed recently and will be implemented beginning in the 1996 model year (58 FR 16002,
March 24, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposed three integrated system preconditioning options for the refueling test in the May 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Option A places the refueling test after the exhaust emissions portion of the supplemental evaporative emissions
test procedure. Option B places the refueling test after the running loss portion of the evaporative emissions test
sequence. As a logical extension to this option, EPA also proposed Option B1, which adds more driving to Option A in
order to allow for more purging of the canister, similar to Option B, while avoiding the complexities of the Option
B running loss procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has selected Option B1, based on the above-described advantages and the support for this choice expressed by commenters.
This procedure follows the supplemental evaporative emission test preconditioning procedure, involving an initial
fuel tank drain and fill with certification test fuel to 40 percent full, a 12 to 36 hour soak at 68
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 86 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (20
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 30 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), a preconditioning drive over one Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle, another fuel tank drain
and fill to 40 percent, a canister preconditioning step detailed below, and then the exhaust emissions test. At this
point the refueling test departs from the evaporative test sequence. Instead, additional driving is conducted to
provide more opportunity for canister purge. This driving consists of a UDDS cycle followed by two New York City Cycles
(NYCC) and then by another UDDS. This driving schedule corresponds to the driving specified for the evaporative running
loss test, though not at the same high temperatures. After the driving, the above-described refueling procedure
is conducted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The canister is preconditioned by loading it with a 50/50 mixture of butane and nitrogen, at a rate of 40 grams of butane
per hour, until 2 grams of hydrocarbons are emitted from the canister (referred to as the 2-gram breakthrough point).
Alternatively, the canister can be loaded to this point with gasoline vapors by conducting repeated diurnal heat
builds. All detailed aspects of the supplemental evaporative emission test procedure, up through the exhaust emission
test, apply to integrated ORVR system testing as well (58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). The three test sequences (full
3-diurnal evaporative, supplemental evaporative, and refueling) may be performed in any order and exhaust emissions
measurements from any of the three may be considered valid. If either evaporative emission sequence has been conducted
before the refueling test, the fuel tank drain and fill and vehicle soak that precede the one UDDS preconditioning
drive in the refueling test sequence may be skipped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Non-Integrated System Preconditioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Non-integrated ORVR systems store only refueling vapors and therefore warrant a preconditioning drivedown of 85
percent of the fuel tank capacity before being subjected to the 85 percent refueling event. This driving consists
of repeated UDDS cycles, either on a track or on a dynamometer, until a volume of fuel equal to 85 percent of the fuel tank
nominal capacity has been consumed. During the actual refueling test, the vehicle will be filled to at least 95 percent
of tank capacity, as is the case for the integrated system. If manufacturers exercise the option to do less driving
in certification testing, EPA may perform subsequent confirmatory and in-use testing using the same reduced driving
schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its discretion, EPA may test non-integrated systems with a partial refueling test procedure. This procedure helps
to ensure control in those in-use refueling events in which less than a tankful of fuel is pumped. Because the non-integrated
system test allows a nearly complete drivedown of the fuel tank capacity, thus enabling purge design strategies that
inappropriately minimize purge during the exhaust emissions test, EPA considers the partial refueling test necessary.
It also allows EPA to assess the basic question of whether the system has the capacity to handle a partial fill, a common
refueling event in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this partial fill test, following the loading of the canister with butane and fueling of the vehicle to 95 percent
of the fuel tank capacity, the vehicle will be driven some integer number of UDDS cycles such that some amount of fuel
between 10 and 85 percent of the fuel tank capacity is consumed. After a one to six hour soak, the vehicle will be subjected
to the refueling emissions measurement test with no intervening drain and fill. The fuel pumped in the test will be
a metered amount, corresponding to the amount consumed in the drive. This amount will be based on the vehicle's fuel
economy, as determined at certification.

4. Seal Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also at its discretion, EPA may perform a seal test of integrated and non-integrated designs, aimed at verifying the
integrity of fillpipe seals and vapor lines. This test eliminates consideration of potential canister emissions
by thoroughly bench purging the canister prior to the refueling event. The canister preconditioning and preparatory
driving are therefore likewise eliminated, although EPA may perform the test procedure up through the exhaust emission
test (in order to obtain this measurement) and then conduct the bench purge and refueling test. Failure of the seal
test would be considered equivalent to failing the full refueling emissions test and the same standard would apply
to both.

5. Cap Removal Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 1993 Notice, EPA requested comment on including a test to measure and control the ``puff loss'' emissions
from a pressurized fuel tank when the fuel cap is removed for refueling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to refueling emissions, vehicles can have emissions when the fuel cap is removed from a pressurized fuel
tank before the refueling event. Although these emissions potentially warrant control, EPA does not view them as
``refueling'' emissions for purposes of section 202(a)(6), since they precede a refueling and are more akin to evaporative
emissions. EPA in fact proposed, but did not finalize, such a cap-off test in the evaporative emissions NPRM (55 FR
1914, January 19, 1990) rather than in the ORVR NPRM. Thus Congress would not have been considering such emissions
when it enacted the 95 percent minimum control standard in section 202(a)(6) in the 1990 CAAAs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers commented that the puff loss test would provide no additional control over that achieved by the refueling
test and the evaporative emissions rule requirement that tanks pressurized to over 10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (25 cm) H

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O be vented to the canister upon cap removal. EPA disagrees with this assessment. The refueling test does not measure
emissions from cap removal directly after vehicle operation. The evaporative emissions requirement allows for
the venting of tank pressures under 10

&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O to the atmosphere. These emissions can be appreciable. General Motors (GM) calculated that the puff loss from venting
a 10 percent full, 20 gallon (76 liter) tank at 10
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O would be about 3 grams. EPA agrees with this estimate but disagrees with the contention that this is minor, given that
this same vehicle would only be allowed to emit a little over 3 grams during the refueling test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM also argued that the execution of a cap-off test involving a warm-up drive followed immediately by a cap-off step
in a SHED would be complex and formidable. EPA agrees with GM's contentions that hot soak emissions could confuse the
puff loss measurement and that the time required to move a vehicle from a dynamometer cell to a SHED and remove the cap
would be overly long compared to the actual in-use event, which typically involves less than a minute from key-off
to cap-off. These two concerns would affect the measured emissions in opposite directions and would make it difficult
to ascertain a puff loss emission corresponding to the in-use event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA remains concerned about puff loss emissions, particularly considering that the new evaporative emission control
requirements may prompt manufacturers to rely more heavily on pressurized tank designs in the future. However, EPA
believes it necessary to defer action on this issue so that an effective test procedure can be developed, involving
more complete public participation. Therefore, EPA is leaving this portion of the rulemaking open for now and intends
to take up this issue as part of the planned further action on pressurized designs announced in the evaporative emissions
control final rule (58 FR 16012). However, it should be noted that the enhanced evaporative emissions rule will require
controls for systems whose pressure exceeds 10 inches H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O, and thus control is already in place for these extreme situations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Spitback Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes, and manufacturers' comments indicate, that vehicles would not be expected to comply with the refueling
emission standard if they emitted significant spitback emissions during the refueling test. Fuel spilled on the
side of the vehicle or in the SHED when the fuel nozzle shuts off will evaporate and be included as part of the refueling
emissions. In recognition of this effect, this final rule also waives the spitback testing requirement for vehicles
being certified to meet the ORVR requirements. Similar to the provision for ``inherently low refueling emission
vehicles'' discussed above, manufacturers can, at their option, certify as part of the certification application,
that they agree with EPA's assessment regarding the effect of spitback emissions on the ability to pass the refueling
emission standard and that their vehicle passes the spitback test standard. Of course, manufacturers may elect to
comply with the spitback test in lieu of using this waiver option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the spitback standard is still required, and EPA is retaining the spitback test and standard promulgated
in the enhanced evaporative emissions control rule (58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). EPA may conduct or require manufacturers
to conduct the spitback test to demonstrate compliance should concerns over vehicle spitback arise.

7. Nozzle Geometry Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, EPA asked for comment on the need for fuel nozzle geometry standards as part of an ORVR program, and suggested
that auto makers and nozzle manufacturers undertake a voluntary initiative to develop national consensus standards
in this area. This initiative is being undertaken under the auspices of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).
An SAE technical committee, comprised of auto maker, fuel nozzle manufacturer, and other representatives, is considering
revisions to SAE standard J285 ``Gasoline Dispenser Nozzle Spouts''.

It is important that nozzles used in the design and testing of ORVR-equipped vehicles be similar to those found in use.
Should this committee reach consensus on fuel nozzle geometry specifications, EPA will use a nozzle meeting this
standard in all refueling emissions compliance testing, if the nozzle manufacturers agree to adopt these specifications
for future retail and commercial fuel nozzles and the auto manufacturers design their ORVR systems to accommodate
a nozzle with this geometry. If no standard is developed for nozzle geometry or if the above agreements cannot be reached,
EPA will use any commercially available nozzle in its testing.

8. Level of the Standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule adopts a refueling test standard of 0.20 grams of hydrocarbon emissions per gallon (g/gal) of fuel
pumped (0.053 g/liter). This standard applies to all vehicle classes covered by this rule and covers the full useful
life. Setting the standard at this level ensures that the standard that meets the statutory requirement to provide
a minimum emission capture efficiency of 95 percent, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 1987 NPRM included a proposed refueling emission standard of 0.10 g/gal (0.026 g/liter) of fuel pumped,
which at that time represented about a 98 percent emissions reduction from uncontrolled levels. Subsequently, the
1990 CAAA called for a refueling emission standard representing at least a 95 percent reduction over uncontrolled
levels. EPA determined that this reduction corresponds to a standard of about 0.25 g/gal (0.066 g/liter) and requested
comment in the May 1993 notice on the setting of a standard in the 0.10 to 0.25 g/gal range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers supported a standard of 0.20 g/gal, arguing that this standard would satisfy the CAA minimum requirement
while providing for full useful life compliance and design flexibility. API and other commenters felt that a standard
providing a 98 percent level of control is justified based on demonstrated and cost effective technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After analyzing the comments and the projected in-use emission impacts, EPA has selected a standard of 0.20 g/gal.
This standard was chosen because it meets or exceeds the statutory minimum requirement and, since it is representative
of most refueling situations reasonably likely to occur (Cf

, 2F.3J 438, 446&hyph;47 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). At the same time, it meets the manufacturers' need for adequate design
margin and flexibility. As is discussed in the Summary and Analysis of Comments, the nature of the canister-based
control technology is such that setting the standard at a lower level would not be expected to achieve additional emission
reductions in use. Systems will need to be designed for essentially zero emissions, with the standard providing an
allowance for vehicle and test variability. It may also enhance the use of liquid fillneck seals which are projected
to have lower costs, good in-use performance, and present no safety concerns.

1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 202(a)(6) of the 1990 CAA Amendments (as well as its predecessor provision) requires EPA to consult with the
Secretary of Transportation regarding the safety of vehicle-based (ORVR) systems for the control of vehicle refueling
emissions. EPA began this consultation in the Spring of 1986, prior to the NPRM, and the consultation has continued
throughout the various stages of this rulemaking. DoT was represented by NHTSA throughout this process. A record
of this consultation and the various analyses conducted by EPA and NHTSA to assess the safety issue is available in
the public docket and is discussed in the April 15, 1992 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice regarding ORVR controls (57 FR 13220). Early in the consultation process, NHTSA raised concerns about the
safety of ORVR canister systems, and throughout the various stages of the rulemaking, safety has been a central issue
in the public comments and in the deliberations on the ORVR rulemaking. Unresolved concerns regarding the safety
of ORVR canister systems (at least relative to Stage II systems) delayed promulgation of the NPRM prior to the 1990
CAAAs and, in April 1992, led EPA to decide not to require ORVR controls at that time. Given the concerns raised about
vehicle safety, it is important to address the potential safety concerns as part of the implementation of the ORVR
requirement.

2. Test Procedure/Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The safety comments regarding ORVR canister systems focused primarily on the concern that ORVR systems would increase
fuel system complexity and that this would create vehicle safety risks. Many manufacturers' comments on the NPRM
indicated that the test procedure, as proposed in 1987, would force the use of non-integrated (separate) systems
for refueling and evaporative emissions control. They characterized these systems as making the fuel vapor control
system more complex than current evaporative control systems, thus creating the potential for a safety risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier, the DC Circuit held that the consultation requirement in section 202(a)(6) does not alter EPA's
duty to issue ORVR requirements. After the decision was issued and after publication of EPA's May 27, 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (58 FR 30731), EPA held technical discussions with representatives of AAMA regarding the ORVR test procedure
(See items IV&hyph;E&hyph;101,102,105,106 in the public docket for this rulemaking). The purpose of these discussions
was to identify potential changes to the ORVR test procedure which, if enacted, would facilitate the use of an integrated
evaporative/refueling control system approach with a liquid seal in the fillneck. (As was discussed above, in March
1993, EPA published a final rule requiring enhanced evaporative controls on gasoline-powered LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs.
The enhanced evaporative requirements will lead to an increase in the size of the canister used to capture evaporative
emissions, an upgrade in the purge system capabilities, as well as other system changes and improvements.) An integrated
system approach would allow manufacturers to make use of the upgraded evaporative control hardware (common carbon
canister, purge system, vapor hoses, etc.) as part of their ORVR control strategy and thus address both system complexity
and cost issues. This approach would be used in lieu of the non-integrated control system approaches which were characterized
as being complex and potentially less safe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORVR test procedure changes which would ease the use of integrated evaporative/refueling control systems with liquid
fillneck seal approaches were identified. EPA explained this option at the July 22, 1993 public hearing and requested
additional public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Auto manufacturer comments supported this approach. For example, Chrysler Corporation's comments indicated:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Chrysler believes that the proposed AAMA revisions to the test procedure and the 0.20 g/gal. standard will allow
Chrysler to design safe, efficient ORVR systems.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Ford recommends that EPA adopt the test procedure changes and standards outlined by AAMA at the Hearing on July 22,
1993, and contained in the attached comments. These changes should allow for the design and development of a canister-based,
integrated refueling and evaporative emissions system which is less complex than a nonintegrated system and which
addresses the safety issues raised in previous rulemakings. These procedural changes along with others identified
in the comments should allow EPA, in consultation with NHTSA, to find that integrated systems do not present an unreasonable
risk to automotive safety.''

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

And, in summary, an October 13, 1993 AAMA letter to NHTSA stated that:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

Comments by other manufacturers also supported this position. Accordingly, this rule enacts the test procedure
option identified above. It is supported by AAMA, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM),
and the individual manufacturers and, according to their comments, minimizes their longstanding vehicle safety
concerns.

3. DOT Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the changed circumstances since it's prior safety analysis, DoT/NHTSA undertook an independent assessment
of vehicle safety concerns associated with ORVR systems. In November 1993, NHTSA completed a study entitled ``An
Assessment of Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery System Safety''. This document reexamined the conclusions raised
in their July 1991 study, upon which EPA relied heavily on its April 1992 decision not to require ORVR controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this recent study, NHTSA revisited the principal findings of its July 1991 report to consider the positive safety
impacts of the test procedure changes and other changed circumstances. The NHTSA report, which is available in the
public docket, reached the following general conclusion regarding ORVR safety:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Basically, there were three principal areas of concern pointed out in the July 1991 report: the increased size of
vapor canisters to hold the fuel vapors, the mechanical complexity of the ORVR system, and the ability of the ORVR system
to safely manage and purge the increased volume of vapors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, technical developments, and test procedure and regulatory changes that have occurred since
the July 1991 safety assessment, have had the net effect of reducing the safety concerns raised in the July 1991 report.
The majority of vehicle manufacturers have stated that it is now possible to design safe ORVR systems that will function
properly under all operating conditions. However, there still remains some small unquantifiable increase in safety
risk due to the addition of the ORVR systems. This risk is unquantifiable since there are no data upon which to base a
numerical estimate.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, NHTSA views the changed circumstances, including the final test procedure and the use of integrated systems,
as addressing many of their previous concerns. They also acknowledge that absent actual data they cannot determine
the level of risk, and thus conclude that risks are unquantifiable. While the NHTSA report contained a brief assessment
as to why trucks might be different than cars and stated that truck prototype systems and field tests for truck ORVR
systems would be beneficial, no special safety risks were cited for using ORVR canisters to control LDT/HDV refueling
emissions.

4. EPA Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is withdrawing its April, 1992 finding that ORVR canisters pose unreasonable safety risks. First, that determination
was based on an improper comparison with Stage II controls.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 983 F. 2d at 271. Considered on their own, ORVR canisters do not appear to pose significant safety risks. Indeed, as
the Agency noted in 1987, this appears to be particularly true for integrated evaporative/refueling control systems_which
now appear to be the preferred control system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA is swayed because NHTSA has reviewed the safety of ORVR systems in light of recent developments and subsequently
has withdrawn most of the adverse conclusions in the 1991 report. NHTSA also indicates (1993 Report pp. 17&hyph;24)
that some of its remaining concerns can be addressed by choosing proper designs for canister systems. As noted above,
EPA has taken NHTSA's views strongly into account throughout the course of this rulemaking, and accordingly is influenced
by NHTSA's more positive outlook on ORVR canister safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record further indicates that installation of ORVR canisters can have some positive impacts on safety. See EPA's
``Summary and Analysis of Comments on the Potential Safety Implications of ORVR Systems'' (IV&hyph;H&hyph;04).
Safety benefits include removal of the external fuel vapor vent line from the fillneck of these vehicles, the expected
move of the canister from the engine compartment to the rear of the vehicle, the resultant shortening of the vapor vent
line, and the capture of fuel vapor previously vented at the service station during refueling. All of these actions
directionally reduce the risk of vehicle fires in crash and non-crash situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, given that the manufacturers indicate that integrated evaporative/refueling control systems minimize
their safety concerns, NHTSA's significant reduction in concerns, EPA's longstanding view of the safety of integrated
refueling/evaporative control systems and the safety benefits of ORVR controls, EPA has decided to withdraw its
April 15, 1992 finding (57 FR 13230&hyph;13231). Specifically, EPA concludes that onboard canister controls do
not pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. ORVR canister systems are not inherently unsafe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters expressed concern about applying the ORVR requirement to trucks and incomplete vehicles (i.e.,
those produced by secondary manufacturers). However, for the most part, EPA does not believe the technical circumstances
here to be substantially different than for LDVs. All trucks, including those produced by secondary manufacturers,
are subject to the enhanced evaporative emission requirements and will have to upgrade their control systems in response
to these new requirements. Also, the ORVR test procedure for these vehicles, as for LDVs, would facilitate the use
of integrated evaporative/ refueling control systems. Potential safety concerns of vehicles completed by secondary
manufacturers should not be substantially different for integrated enhanced evaporative/refueling control systems
than they are for enhanced evaporative control systems alone. This is especially the case for those incomplete vehicles
delivered to the secondary manufacturer with a complete fuel system as are most incomplete LDTs. Also, the potential
safety benefits of ORVR systems would accrue to trucks and secondary manufacturer vehicles as well as to LDVs. Thus,
EPA believes the safety concerns, if any, to be similar to those for LDVs. In fact, while the manufacturers opposed
extending the ORVR requirement to trucks on several grounds, none indicated that safe truck ORVR systems were not
possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, EPA's decision not to finalize ORVR requirements for HDVs (both complete and incomplete HDVs) at this
time and to delay LDT implementation for three years or more should minimize any remaining safety concerns about ORVR
systems for trucks (IV&hyph;H&hyph;23).

Nonetheless, EPA is very sensitive to the uncertainties expressed by NHTSA, and plans a program to implement its authority
to ensure safe systems. Sections 202(a)(4) and 206(a)(3)(A), (B) of the CAA give EPA broad authority to address the
safety of emission control systems. Section 202(a)(4) reads:

This authority has been implemented for more than ten years. The Code of Federal Regulations &sect;86.084&hyph;5(b)
requires that any system installed on a new motor vehicle to enable such a vehicle to conform to standards shall not
in its operation, function, or malfunction result in any unsafe condition endangering the motor vehicle, its occupants,
or persons or property in close proximity to the vehicle. Furthermore, &sect;86.091&hyph;23(d) requires that manufacturers
certify that the vehicles for which emission certification is requested conform to the requirements of &sect;86.084&hyph;5(b).
The manufacturer must also agree to provide descriptions of the tests conducted, the results of such tests, and other
information upon which that determination is based. Presently this safety certification is submitted in the application
for certification which manufacturers must submit for every vehicle model they plan to produce for commerce in the
United States. EPA intends to use this authority and the approach described above to implement the ORVR requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate responsibility for ORVR system safety (both design and performance in use) rests with the manufacturers.
As part of the application for certification, manufacturers will be required to make the declarations prescribed
in &sect;86.091&hyph;23 (d). During review of the certification application, EPA will study the design of the vehicle's
ORVR system, its on-vehicle configuration and operation, and will consult directly with NHTSA on these applications.
Special consideration will be given to the potential concerns raised in the course of the rulemaking process such
as component locations, materials used in the components, and connections between components. For canister-based
systems, items of special interest will include canister location and shell construction, canister/vapor hose
access for I/M testing, vapor hose routing and wall thickness, integrity of connections, and proximity of potential
ignition sources. In addition, manufacturers will want to consider concerns raised in past NHTSA safety assessments.
The November 1993 NHTSA report makes it clear that proper design is critical in system safety performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was mentioned above, EPA could ask for any or all of the information supporting the manufacturer's safety assessment
and EPA will consider all information presented by the manufacturer in this assessment whether it is based on testing,
engineering analysis, or some other source. As is present practice, EPA expects that manufacturers will conduct
engineering risk assessments and component, system, and vehicle tests to assess the safety of various ORVR system
designs and on-vehicle configurations and make any modifications or devise and implement the engineering solutions
needed to address potential problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORVR-equipped vehicles would have to meet the applicable FMVSSs, including FMVSS 301 related to Fuel System Integrity.
As noted above, NHTSA is considering amending the latter to address ORVR system safety. However, section 206(a)(3)(B)
of the CAA provides EPA with broad latitude to require manufacturers to conduct tests or provide other information
as may be needed to determine if an ORVR system meets the vehicle safety requirements prescribed in section 202(a)(4).

 notice, EPA asked for comment on whether any specific tests or other information should be required up front as part

In the same notice, EPA also asked comment from auto manufacturers and other interested parties on the desirability
of developing a process, after promulgation of the final rule, through which there could be a dialogue with EPA and
NHTSA on design questions related to the in-use safety of ORVR systems. Manufacturers' comments indicated that resolution
of the safety issue as part of the rule was most important, and they expressed little interest in establishing a dialogue
at this time. EPA remains willing to work with the auto manufacturers in this area at any time in the future.

Although ultimate safety determinations must await the certification process, EPA wishes to repeat that it knows
of nothing that would preclude the certification of properly designed ORVR canister systems on LDVs and LDTs. EPA
stresses that it has never determined for purposes of certification under section 206 that any specific ORVR system
(including ORVR canisters) would present an unreasonable risk to public safety within the meaning of section 202(a)(4),
58 FR 30740&hyph;30741. Consequently, the potential existence of means other than canisters to control refueling
emissions should not preclude certification of properly-designed canister-based control systems.

As part of the technical analysis supporting the NPRM, EPA indicated that control technologies such as collapsible
fuel bladders and cloth impregnated with activated carbon absorbers were potential alternatives to carbon canisters.
As part of the technology assessment for this final rule, EPA reviewed the record of the rule to see what options had
been put forth and to assess what progress had been made in applying these technologies to vehicle fuel systems. The
collective determination from the review was that, in some cases, parties have pursued development of these technologies
for other applications, such as aircraft fuel systems and chemical protection suits, but that less overall progress
has been made in applying these technologies to automotive applications. In some cases no progress was made, and the
technical feasibility of these designs therefore remains problematic. In one case commercial development was dependent
on industry or government support. While EPA cannot arbitrarily preclude the use of any control system design approach,
EPA concludes that such alternatives are not generally likely to be available for production application in the time
frame when manufacturers must begin to install ORVR systems on their vehicles. The potential existence of these alternative
control approaches does not preclude certification of properly designed canister-based ORVR controls.

1. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action modifies the certification process by adding the requirement for demonstrating compliance with
refueling emission standards according to the prescribed phase-in schedule. This action is expected to have no direct
impact on manufacturers' fuel economy programs. The following paragraphs summarize EPA's certification and fuel
economy requirements with regard to ORVR controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations promulgated in this action provide new definitions for refueling families and refueling emission
control systems. For LDVs and LDTs, manufacturers will normally perform a refueling test on one emission-data vehicle
per refueling emission control system and submit this test data (low altitude data) to EPA for possible confirmatory
testing. Data submitted to EPA should include the exhaust emissions data from the exhaust emissions test which is
contained in the refueling test sequence. The data should demonstrate compliance with all applicable emission standards.
Manufacturers may submit high altitude test data to EPA for possible confirmatory testing, or provide a statement
in the application for certification that vehicles will comply with applicable emission standards at high altitude.
Note that this action requires manufacturers to perform exhaust and evaporative emission tests using pre-loaded
canisters. Also note that vehicles inherently low in refueling emissions can be certified using an engineering evaluation
approved by the Administrator in lieu of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the testing has been completed, manufacturers typically submit to EPA an application for certification, containing
information about the vehicles intended for production, emission test data used to support certification, statements
of compliance with emission standards and device safety, and other information required by EPA. This action will
require manufacturers to provide refueling information in their application for certification. To determine compliance
with applicable emission standards, this action requires the refueling emission test data to be adjusted by an additive
deterioration factor, developed by the manufacturer using good engineering judgement to assure that vehicles will
comply in actual use for the useful life of the vehicle/engine. Should EPA have any concerns about the safety of the
ORVR refueling system used by the manufacturer, certification may be delayed or denied, under section 202(a)(4)
and 206(a)(3) of the CAA. This should not happen, however, with properly designed systems.

2. Fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA-incurred costs associated with the certification program can be recovered in the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance
Program (MVECP) fee program (see 40 CFR part 86, subpart J). Today's action is likely to increase the amount of the MVECP
fee which is collected during the certification process since the Agency's burden is expected to increase. As discussed
in the Fee Updating Procedure section of the Fees final rule, (57 FR 30049, July 7, 1992), EPA will periodically review
its fees. During that fee updating process, the Agency intends to assess the additional burden incurred due to this
action, and if, as a result of the review, EPA determines that there has been a significant change in the MVECP costs,
a proposal to revise the fee schedule will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, manufacturers will be provided with sufficient notice and comment period prior to any changes in the amount
of the fee collected.

3. Fuel Economy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not have any direct impact on fuel economy labeling, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE), or gas
guzzler data submission requirements. Because the changes to the test procedure promulgated in this action may affect
fuel economy measurements,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA will not require use of the new procedure for fuel economy testing. Therefore, to generate city fuel economy values,
manufacturers may use the previously established Federal Test Procedure or may optionally use the pre-loaded canister
test procedures established in this action (which are essentially the same test procedures established in the enhanced
evaporative emission final rule, ref. 58 FR 16002, March 24, 1993). EPA will normally use the same procedure for confirmatory
testing as used by the manufacturer.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The fuel economy measurements may be affected because vehicles will now be tested with pre-loaded evaporative/onboard
canisters. Purging these canisters during the city and highway tests could affect the air/fuel ratio of the engine
which, in turn, could affect the measured fuel economy values for the test vehicle. EPA expects the effect to be minimal,
although it is possible that measured fuel economy values could change for some vehicles.

F. Onboard Diagnostics Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's action extends the existing provisions for onboard diagnostic (OBD) systems to ORVR equipment. (The final
rule for the existing program was published February 19, 1993, 58 FR 9468). ORVR systems are very similar to evaporative
systems and this action requires that the OBD performance requirements which currently apply to evaporative systems
apply on LDVs and LDTs also to ORVR systems, both integrated and non-integrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the current OBD program for evaporative-only systems, OBD monitoring of the ORVR system is not mandatory.
However, the same approach to in-use testing will be used. That is, any in-use vehicle with evaporative emissions
of 30 g/test or higher measured over the first 24 hours of the three-day diurnal from the revised evaporative test procedure
will be flagged for further evaluation. That evaluation will consist of making any necessary repairs to ensure system
integrity, and then making a 0.04 inch (1 mm) orifice anywhere within the system. To demonstrate compliance, operating
the vehicle in this condition over the full FTP must cause the malfunction indicator light (MIL) to illuminate. A failure
of the OBD system to signal a problem could contribute to a decision to initiate a recall action. While a system operating
in such a manner (i.e., without the MIL going on) may not detect a malfunction related solely to refueling events, EPA
nevertheless believes that such a system will be sufficient if it detects general problems with vapor and purge system
integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For integrated ORVR systems, manufacturers can use the same OBD systems they use to monitor evaporative systems.
For non-integrated systems, both the evaporative and refueling sides of the system will need to be monitored. It should
be possible for the same technology to be used for both monitoring tasks in most cases. For example, a strategy that
uses engine vacuum to draw a certain minimum level of vacuum or uses a small pump to generate a positive pressure in the
entire vapor system could include a non-integrated ORVR canister in the monitoring as well. For both integrated and
non-integrated systems, EPA believes this approach will result in an adequate level of certainty that key potential
malfunctions in ORVR systems will be identified and repaired. Since a 0.04 inch orifice would emit only about 3 grams
of hydrocarbon vapor in a normal refueling event, this approach will assure a high level of in-use control.

1. Liability Periods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the CAAA of 1990, ORVR controls for new LDVs must have useful lives of 10 years or 100,000 miles (160,000
km) or the equivalent, with recall testing allowed up to 7 years or 75,000 miles (120,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever
occurs first (CAA section 202(d)(1); 42 U.S.C. 7521(d)(1)). LDTs with loaded vehicle weight up to 3,750 pounds (1,700
kg) have the same useful life requirement as LDVs. All other LDTs have a useful life requirement of 11 years or 120,000
miles (190,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first. Pursuant to section 207(i), expected designs for ORVR
controls are not ``specified major emission control components,'' because they cost less than $200. Therefore,
unless more expensive components are utilized, manufacturers need only warrant them for 2 years or 24,000 miles (39,000
km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first. If, at some time in the future, the Administrator should determine
that the ORVR controls are ``specified major emission control components,'' manufacturers must warrant them for
8 years or 80,000 miles (130,000 km) or the equivalent, whichever occurs first (CAA section 207(i)(2); 42 U.S.C. 7541(i)(2)).

2. Selective Enforcement Audit Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to CAA section 206(b), the Administrator is authorized to test new motor vehicles in order to determine whether
vehicles being manufactured do in fact conform to the regulations with respect to which a certificate of conformity
was issued. Therefore, LDVs and LDTs that are certified to meet the refueling emission standard are subject to this
standard in a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1987 NPRM, EPA discussed two testing issues which resulted from performing the refueling test on newly built
motor vehicles. The first issue regarded the possible influence of new vehicle background evaporative emissions
(i.e., hydrocarbon emissions from such things as the fresh paint on a new vehicle which has not fully cured) on refueling
emission measurements. Historically, EPA has not conducted SEA testing for evaporative emissions due to the relatively
large non-fuel background emissions emitted from newly built vehicles. However, EPA expected that background emissions
would not significantly affect refueling emission measurements because the actual time for background evaporative
losses to occur would be very short (refueling emission measurements have a duration of less than five minutes). Also,
refueling measurements would be taken at an ambient temperature of approximately 80
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F, so fuel and non-fuel evaporative emissions would not be increased by heating of the tank, engine, or other
subsystems, as would occur during the usual evaporative emissions test. However, to address any concerns over the
effects of background emissions, EPA proposed an additional SEA testing procedure where background emissions would
be measured and then subtracted from the refueling emissions measurement. This additional procedure would be used
if manufacturers provided evidence that newly built vehicle background emissions would significantly exceed in-use
vehicle background emissions, which were intended to be included in the refueling standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because manufacturers' comments raised concerns about conducting the refueling test without measuring for background
emissions, and about the extra time needed for the measurement, this final rule will include the new vehicle background
emissions measurement proposed in the 1987 NPRM as an optional procedure. However, this decision must be made before
SEA testing is conducted. It will apply to all vehicles tested. EPA realizes that when this background procedure is
performed, in-use background emissions, which are included in the refueling standard, will also be subtracted from
the refueling measurement. At this time, EPA has no way of separating new vehicle background emissions from in-use
background emissions. For purposes of SEA testing only, both may therefore be subtracted off. Background emissions
from the refueling measurements during in-use testing will not be subtracted since the standard includes measurement
of such emissions and there is no concern regarding the higher background emissions from new vehicles. Additionally,
upon approval by EPA, a manufacturer may develop and use its own background emissions measurement procedure for use
during SEA testing. Revisions to 40 CFR part 86, subpart G, &sect;86.608 (for LDVs) and to subpart K, &sect;86.1008
(for LDTs) incorporate this additional procedure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second issue pertained to the unstabilized condition of the vapor storage canister(s) prior to SEA testing. In
the NPRM, EPA proposed that the canisters of SEA vehicles be stabilized through a bench procedure, prior to refueling
emissions testing, to help account for any large differences that may exist between an unused canister and a broken-in
(aged) canister. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most manufacturers commented that artificially aging canisters prior to emissions testing using either the procedure
in the 1987 proposal or the evaporative emissions rulemaking is inconsistent with SEA testing and that performing
the aging process would significantly add to the time needed to complete testing. This would make it difficult to conduct
the correct number of tests per twenty-four hour period as proposed by &sect;86.608(g) for LDVs and &sect;86.1008(g)(3)
for LDTs. Additionally, several manufacturers indicated that if their vehicles were to undergo the entire refueling
test procedure (with all of the necessary preconditioning drive-downs), the vehicles may accumulate too many miles
to be sold as new. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA agrees that the proposed bench-aging procedure, as well as the updated procedure, adds significant time to SEA
testing and, therefore, this final rule does not include an artificial aging procedure. EPA would have preferred
to include an aged canister in the SEA test requirement, but at this point sees no practical way to incorporate the aged
canister requirement and also address the manufacturers' concerns. Manufacturers are required to perform the complete
refueling test with new canisters for both integrated and non-integrated designs. However, if manufacturers still
have concerns about conducting the required number of tests per twenty-four hour period or accumulating too much
mileage, they may, upon EPA approval, perform the seal test described in Section C above, for either integrated or
non-integrated designs, during an SEA. The seal test is aimed at verifying the integrity of fillpipe seals and vapor
lines and eliminates consideration of potential canister emissions by thoroughly bench purging the canister prior
to the refueling event. The canister preconditioning and preparatory driving are also eliminated, allowing manufacturers
to complete testing without the additional mileage accumulation associated with the full test. Finally, the same
0.20 g/gal standard would apply and failure of the seal test would be considered equivalent to failing the full refueling
emissions test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During an SEA, manufacturers will test selected SEA vehicles until a pass or fail decision has been reached for both
the exhaust emission test and the refueling test. The 0.20 g/gal refueling standard is subject to 40 percent Acceptable
Quality Level, which is the same criteria used for exhaust emissions.

3. Nonconformance Penalties (NCPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the regulations governing NCPs (40 CFR 86.1103&hyph;87), EPA specifies the criteria which must be met before an
NCP will be made available for a new emission standard applicable to any subclass of heavy-duty vehicles (i.e., vehicles
with a GVWR in excess of 6000 lbs, including the LDTs with a GVWR between 6,001 and 8,500 lbs. which are covered in this
regulation (HLDTs)). As described in those regulations, an NCP may be established for a new emission standard if substantial
work will be required to meet the new standard and a technological laggard is likely to exist. Substantial work means
the application of technology not previously used in a vehicle class or subclass or the significant modification
of existing technology or design parameters.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While ORVR systems have not been used to control refueling emissions on HLDTs and HDVs, EPA does not believe that an
ORVR requirement constitutes substantial work as defined in the NCP regulations nor does EPA believe that a technological
laggard will exist in the vehicle groups. The ORVR system is expected to be a minor extension of existing evaporative
emission control technology rather than the application of new technology or the significant modification of existing
technology or design. EPA expects manufacturers would use activated carbon for storage of refueling vapors and air
stripping for regeneration, just as are now used in evaporative emission control systems on LDTs and heavy-duty gasoline
vehicles. The purge systems will essentially be the same as those used for evaporative controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there may be some subjective disagreement on whether ``substantial work'' will be involved in meeting the standard,
EPA believes all the manufacturers of HLDTs will be able to comply with the standard and that no technological laggard
will exist. EPA recognizes that effort will be required to equip the HLDTs with ORVR systems, but the control technology
required is well defined and available to all affected manufacturers. Furthermore, this regulation provides a generous
leadtime and control is phased in over a three-model-year period. Both of these factors will provide relief to any
manufacturer who is having difficulty. In addition, the adopted test procedures address the manufacturers' technical
concerns and should negate the need for an NCP for any manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also permit consideration of NCPs for other emission standards, for which NCPs are not already provided,
if the standards become more difficult to meet as a result of a new standard. However, as the test procedure is structured,
EPA does not believe that manufacturers will encounter significant additional difficulty in maintaining compliance
with exhaust or evaporative emission standards as a result of the ORVR requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, ``substantial work'' will not be required and no technological laggards are expected. Therefore, EPA will
not make NCPs available for refueling exhaust or evaporative emission standards.

4. In-Use Performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As in the case of other evaporative emissions, the control of refueling emissions is highly dependent on vehicle operating
and environmental factors such as vehicle speed and ambient temperature. EPA recognizes, therefore, that simply
passing a test procedure cannot always ensure vehicle designs that achieve good control in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA expects that manufacturers will design vehicles that pass the test and perform well in use. However, in order to
best achieve the statutory goal of a high degree of control efficiency, the Agency will, if necessary, make full use
of existing regulations against defeat devices. Thus, EPA may deny certification upon determination that a particular
refueling emission control system design constitutes a defeat device (40 CFR 86.094&hyph;16).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA could also invoke the defeat device regulations in the course or on the basis of the results of selective enforcement
audit (SEA) and recall testing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion, while not necessarily all-inclusive, provides examples of potential defeat devices
related to compliance with refueling emission standards. EPA's main concern is that some purge strategies used to
pass emission tests may be ineffective over a wide range of in-use driving patterns. For integrated systems, this
concern will be addressed in the Agency's evaluation of evaporative system purge strategies during the certification
process, as discussed in the evaporative emissions final rule (58 FR at 16007). The Agency will extend this evaluation
to non-integrated refueling system purge strategies as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This evaluation is intended to identify vehicle designs that, though capable of passing emission tests, may not function
effectively in use. These would include non-integrated system designs that purge well during the prolonged warm-vehicle
driving allowed in the refueling test drivedown, but not in the driving patterns involving frequent cold starts often
encountered in use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also will consider to be defeat devices those designs that purge at substantially higher rates during high-speed
operation than during low-speed operation, such that they primarily depend on the high-speed purge to pass emission
tests. Even if such designs do pass the test, they may produce high refueling emissions if they purge substantially
less during typical non-freeway urban driving than during the refueling test drivedown. Also, designs that shut
purge off at any time for other than safety reasons would be closely examined by EPA for possible classification as
defeat devices.

III. Public Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORVR controls have been under consideration by EPA since the CAAAs of 1977. The public process, which first began in
1978, has proceeded through various stages over the past 15 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the provisions of section 202(a)(6) of the 1977 CAAAs, EPA initiated a public process in 1978 to receive
comments on the feasibility and desirability of implementing ORVR controls. In 1980, EPA published a technical report
which tentatively concluded that ORVR controls were feasible for LDVs. However, no action was taken at the time due
to concerns over economic difficulties in the auto industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA reinstituted its assessment of ORVR controls in 1983 as part of a broad assessment of the strategies available
to control emissions in the gasoline marketing industry. As part of this study, in August 1984, EPA published an extensive
analysis of the options available to control refueling emissions including ORVR controls. Supporting documentation
for this analysis are in public docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07, along with the public comments received on the ``Gasoline
Marketing Study''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving comments on the study, EPA prepared an in-depth analysis of the comments, developed further work
on several key issues related to ORVR controls, and conducted enhanced assessments of the options under consideration.
This resulted in a draft Regulatory Impact Analysis, Response to Public Comments, and related analysis and documentation
related to ORVR controls. This information is also in public docket A&hyph;84&hyph;07. A public meeting regarding
the ORVR test procedure was also held during this time frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of EPA's study of emission control options for the gasoline marketing industry culminated in an August
1987 proposal to require ORVR controls on gasoline-powered LDVs, LDTs, and HDVs. A public hearing was held in October
1987 and the comment period closed in February 1988. Information supporting the NPRM and comments on the proposal
are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11. However, due initially to safety concerns raised by some commenters and
later to pending revisions to the CAA, EPA deferred action on finalizing the ORVR rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 CAAAs contained provisions requiring an integrated program of LDV ORVR and Stage II controls. In response
to the ORVR provisions, on September 3, 1991 (56 FR 43682), EPA published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice seeking further comment on the NPRM and the safety issues related to ORVR controls including a safety assessment
prepared by the DoT. A public hearing was held to receive comment on these issues on September 26, 27, 1991. The comment
period closed in late October 1991. These comments and related materials are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11.
On April 15, 1992, EPA published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (57 FR 13220) announcing its decision not to proceed with implementing ORVR controls at that time, based on
safety concerns raised by DoT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, a panel of the DC Circuit overturned EPA's 1992 action. EPA then published another 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (May 27, 1993, 58 FR 30731) raising issues for public comment and allowing approximately 90 days for comment.
Another public hearing seeking comment on the NPRM and other changed circumstances was also held. This hearing was
held on July 22, 1993 and comments closed 30 days later. These comments are in public docket A&hyph;87&hyph;11 as are
EPA materials in support of the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the years in which ORVR has been under consideration, there have been at least five formal opportunities for
oral and/or written public comment. In addition, numerous other public interactions have occurred on this matter
and have been documented and placed in the docket for public review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the fifteen years of the ORVR public process, EPA has received hundreds of written comments regarding this requirement.
However, many of the past comments have essentially been addressed by changed circumstances or other developments.
Major issues such as fuel volatility and improved vehicle evaporative emission controls have now been decided by
regulation, and the control of refueling emissions using Stage II equipment was addressed by the 1990 CAAAs. Also,
many previous comments in areas such as ORVR costs and test procedures were factored into subsequent analyses and
notices, making only the most recent set of comments applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public docket contains a Summary and Analysis of Comments document which addresses still-relevant issues raised
by the commenters. It generally does not address past comments on issues which have been resolved by related statutory
or regulatory action or through subsequent published analyses or

IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the assessment and decision making process regarding ORVR controls, EPA has prepared an in-depth Regulatory
Impact Analysis (RIA). This RIA is available in the public docket. The RIA assesses the environmental impact, costs,
and cost effectiveness of ORVR controls, as well as other associated benefits, for the combined LDV and LDT program
described above for a number of scenarios. It also includes a sensitivity analysis for several key parameters. It
should be noted that the RIA was completed prior to EPA's decision to delay the requirements for LDTs and to exclude
HDVs. These controls were included in the analysis and were assumed to begin in 1998. EPA expects that inclusion of
these items in the analysis has no significant effect on the results and does not affect the conclusions which are based
on the analysis. The major findings of the RIA for LDV and LDT ORVR controls are presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before discussing these key findings, it is important to note that EPA analysis has assumed that ORVR controls will
apply nationwide to all vehicle classes. However, the scenarios analyzed focus not only on the overall nationwide
control program, but also on the control in the ozone NAAs. Furthermore, since Stage II controls are in place or expected
in most of the ozone NAAs, the incremental impacts of ORVR controls relative to Stage II are assessed as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While refueling emissions control has value whenever it occurs, it is most critical during the ozone season. The five
month ozone season refueling emission inventory is about 200,000 tons per year; when annualized, this value increases
to approximately 475,000 tons per year. Refueling emissions vary directly with fuel use and fuel RVP/temperatures.
Approximately 52 percent of refueling emissions occur in AAs and 48 percent occur in NAAs. Of this 48 percent, about
33 percent currently are, or are expected to be, subject to Stage II control equipment. The percentage of gasoline
consumption in the NAAs and covered by Stage II is slightly higher (55 and 44 percent respectively) than the contribution
to the refueling emission inventory, primarily due to RVP controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission reductions achieved by ORVR controls depend on the in-use efficiency of the control system and the area
in which the control is applied. Based on the stringency of the test procedure the full life useful life certification
requirement, and the salutary effect of Inspection/Maintenance (I/M) programs and onboard diagnostics, EPA expects
very high in-use efficiency from ORVR systems. In the ozone NAAs, where RVP control and basic and enhanced I/M are prevalent,
EPA expects in-use efficiency of over 95 percent, with a somewhat lower value in attainment areas due to lack of RVP
control and I/M. In the ozone NAAs, EPA expects in-use efficiency of approximately 97 percent. The in-use efficiency
in attainment areas (which would lack RVP control and enhanced I/M) is somewhat less, and in some cases is predicted
to be less than 95 percent. The Agency notes, however, that this prediction is skewed because data for the southeast
U.S. indicate that average dispensed fuel temperature in that region is seven fahrenheit degrees higher than anywhere
else in the country. EPA is basing its predictions on this information because it is the only available data. However,
the Agency knows of no reason why dispensed fuel temperatures should be so much higher in this region. If the same range
of dispensed fuel temperatures were used for the southeast region as for the southwest U.S., the in-use efficiency
of properly operating systems in all areas would be predicted to average 95 percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The benefits vary over time and with the scenario analyzed. Benefits vary over time because of the phase-in of the ORVR
requirement and the need for fleet turnover to occur before full implementation of ORVR-equipped vehicles occurs.
The key variable with regard to scenarios is the presence and possible phase-out of Stage II controls. ORVR benefits
in NAAs include control over service stations in NAAs without Stage II, control at service stations which now receive
waivers, and control over vapors missed by Stage II equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the rulemaking as a whole, neglecting the presence of Stage II controls, LDV/LDT ORVR would achieve average annual
emission reductions of over 420,000 tons per year. With Stage II phaseout when ORVR and Stage II would cover the same
percent of fuel in use, the average annual emission reduction is about 378,000 tons. Even if Stage II controls are retained,
an incremental benefit of 285,000 tons occurs nationwide. Of these reductions, approximately 20 percent occur in
NA areas, with the overall percentage in NAAs increasing substantially if Stage II is phased out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Costs of Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ORVR costs of control are comprised of control system hardware costs plus short term (five year) costs for research,
development, and testing (R,D,&amp; T) minus fuel vapor recovery credits. Costs were derived incremental to the
effects of enhanced evaporative emissions and RVP control, with the assumption that most vehicles would use integrated
evaporative/refueling control systems with liquid seals in the fillneck. The retail price equivalent (RPE) for
hardware and R,D,&amp; T costs range from $6&hyph;8 for LDVs and LDTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even these small costs are somewhat offset by ORVR fuel recovery credits. The level of the ORVR recovery credit depends
on whether Stage II equipment is used when refueling. For the nationwide case, which involves Stage II and non-Stage
II areas, the NPV of the recovery credit ranges from $2&hyph;$4 per-vehicle for LDVs and LDTs. Accounting for these
recovery credits, both short and long term net costs are under $5 for LDVs and LDTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA assessed the net costs of LDV and LDT ORVR controls for three scenarios. The first (baseline) scenario neglected
the presence of Stage II controls, the second accounted for Stage II controls with phaseout in 2010, and the third included
Stage II with no phaseout. In each case, the ORVR hardware and R,D,&amp; T costs are the same, but the recovery credit
varies. In the first case the average annual cost is about ^$6 million over the period 1998&hyph;2020. With Stage II
present and phasing out in 2010, the average annual costs is $2 million. With no phase out average annual costs increase
to $27 million over the period 1998 to 2020. The 1998 NPV costs (discounted at 7 percent to 1998) for the same three scenarios
are $102 million, $264 million, and $435 million, respectively. In the cases where costs are negative, it is because
the value of the recovery credits exceeds the hardware and R, D, &amp; T costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Cost Effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the net present value of the costs and emission reduction benefits, EPA has calculated the cost effectiveness
of LDV/LDT ORVR controls for the three scenarios mentioned above. For the first case where Stage II controls are neglected,
the cost effectiveness is about $35 per ton. In the second case where Stage II control is considered, but phased out
in 2010, the cost effectiveness is about $100 per ton. In the final case where Stage II is not phased out, the cost effectiveness
is about $210 per ton. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When all costs are included in the calculations but only NAA emission reductions are credited, the cost effectiveness
values change. For the first case discussed above, cost effectiveness value is $70 per ton. In the second and third
scenarios, the cost effectiveness would increase to about $250 and $775 per ton, respectively.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the VOC emission reduction benefits cited above, LDV/LDT ORVR controls have other benefits. ORVR controls
would result in an average energy savings equivalent to 78 million gallons of gasoline per year between the period
1998 and 2020 assuming no Stage II phaseout and about 108 million gallons per year if Stage II is phased out. In addition,
there will be health benefits as a result of reductions in air toxic emissions. Best estimates are the avoidance of
about 5&hyph;6 cancer incidences per year as a result of lower refueling benzene emissions. Additional cancer avoidances
are possible depending on the assumption regarding the toxicological impact of the remainder of the constituents
of the gasoline vapor. Reductions in potential non-cancer health effects and welfare benefits such as reduced crop
and material damage due to ozone would occur as well.

E. Benefit-Cost Ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comparing the average annual cost and emission reduction benefits shown in the tables presented in the RIA, if even
a minimal dollar value of $500 per ton is ascribed to the health and environmental benefits, the dollar benefits of
LDV/LDT ORVR controls exceed the costs. The benefit to cost ratio for NA areas ranges from 1.3 for the scenario where
Stage II is retained to 32 if Stage II is phased out. If Stage II operating costs which are no longer incurred after Stage
II phaseout are considered, there is an annual average monetary savings of about $40 million since the costs of operating
the Stage II control technology are eliminated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:

(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or he principles
set forth in the Executive Order.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These final regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the Order
the Administrator has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because this rule has an effect on the long-term implications of stationary and mobile source controls and
requires interagency consultations. The average annual cost is about $27 million over the period 1998 to 2020, assuming
no Stage II phaseout. If Stage II is phased out, recovery credits for ORVR systems increase to the point that average
annual costs are only about $2 million (ignoring the savings in Stage II maintenance). As such, this action was submitted
to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public
record.

IX. Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a rulemaking, it must
prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is not required
if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for ORVR systems in this regulation apply to motor vehicle manufacturers. Small LDV manufacturers
have been granted a delayed phase-in of the ORVR requirement and LDT manufacturers have a longer leadtime than originally
proposed. Therefore, I certify that this rule will not have a significant adverse impact on a substantial number of
small entities.

. (i) Vehicle driving on a chassis dynamometer shall consist of repeated drives with the UDDS until 85 percent of fuel
tank capacity has been consumed. Driving in testing performed by manufacturers may be terminated before 85 percent
of the fuel tank capacity has been consumed, provided that driving is not terminated partway through a UDDS cycle.
Driving in testing performed by the Administrator may be terminated after the same number of UDDS cycles as driven
in the manufacturer's certification testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Except with the advance approval of the Administrator, the number of UDDSs required to consume 85 percent of tank
fuel capacity (total capacity of both tanks when the vehicle is equipped with dual fuel tanks) shall be determined
from the fuel economy on the UDDS applicable to the test vehicle and from the number of gallons to the nearest 0.1 gallon
(0.38 liter) that constitutes 85 percent of tank volume. If this ``fuel consumed point'' occurs partway through a
UDDS cycle, the cycle shall be completed in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For vehicles equipped with dual fuel tanks, fuel switching from the first tank to the second tank shall occur
at the 10 percent volume of the first tank regardless of the point in the UDDS cycle at which this occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If necessary to accommodate work schedules, the engine may be turned off and the vehicle parked on the dynamometer.
The vehicle may be parked off of the dynamometer to facilitate maintenance or repairs if required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) During the driving on the dynamometer, a cooling fan(s) shall be positioned as described in &sect;86.135&hyph;94(b).

approve optional test procedures other than those in subparts B, C, and O of this part for any motor vehicle which is
not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts B, C, and O of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart B of this part are applicable to Selective Enforcement
Audit testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel meeting the specifications for mileage and service
accumulation fuels of &sect;86.113&hyph;94. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified
in this section only with the advance approval of the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the
fuel tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may drain the test
fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(b) and &sect;86.152&hyph;98(a),
provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall
be made available upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA test vehicles other than the preconditioning
specified in &sect;86.132&hyph;98 only if the additional preconditioning had been performed on certification
test vehicles of the same configuration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described
in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours following vehicle
preconditioning rather than according to the time period specified in &sect;86.133&hyph;90(a). All references

of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers
is placed in the standby position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in the sample collection bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The manufacturer need not comply with &sect;86.142&hyph;90 or &sect;86.155&hyph;98, since the records
required therein are provided under other provisions of this subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi)
of this section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test procedure, the elapsed time between the initial
and final FID readings shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98(e)(8).
In addition, the vehicle soak described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and luggage
compartment of the vehicle open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b), of both integrated
and non-integrated systems instead of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, an manufacturer
may conduct the canister purge described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning
drive described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to perform the following background emissions determination
immediately prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98, provided EPA is notified
of this decision prior to the start of testing in an SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior to the background determination. Warning: If at
any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the background determination.
If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel mixing blower shall be turned on at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level encountered by the test vehicle during the entire
background emissions determination shall be 80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The windows and luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be secured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the
initial background hydrocarbon concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the end of the background
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background determination is calculated according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98.
To obtain a per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass calculated in this paragraph
by the duration of the soak, rounded to the nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi)(G) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph
(a)(2)(ix) of this section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of emissions calculated for the refueling
test according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The final
results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall be computed by dividing the adjusted value for
total refueling mass emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test as described in &sect;86.156&hyph;98(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and
methanol-fueled vehicles as follows prior to emission testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere
by applying a pressure of 14.5

0.1 Kpa) to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the fuel system from the pressure source.
Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) in five minutes.
If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and
report this action in accordance with &sect;86.609&hyph;98(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative
or refueling emission control systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative or refueling emission control systems by component
addition, deletion, or substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if approved in advance
by the Administrator.

subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For 1981 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter
which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for new vehicle compliance testing (e.g., for
certification or Selective Enforcement Audit testing) in accordance with &sect;86.081&hyph;22(c)(1), to any
setting within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance
with &sect;86.081&hyph;22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter
is one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to
a setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable range of the
idle speed parameter on the vehicle when it has accumulated 4,000 miles, all other parameters being adjusted identically
for the purpose of comparison. The Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect
of the deviation from the manufacturer's recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well
as the likelihood that similar settings will occur on in-use light-duty vehicles or light-duty trucks. In determining
likelihood, the Administrator will consider factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on vehicle
performance characteristics and surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to performing emission testing pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section on an SEA test vehicle, the manufacturer
may accumulate on each vehicle a number of miles equal to the greater of 4,000 miles, or the number of miles the manufacturer
accumulated during certification on the emission-data vehicle corresponding to the configuration specified in
the test order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Mileage accumulation must be performed in any manner using good engineering judgment to obtain emission results
representative of normal production vehicles. This mileage accumulation must be consistent with the new vehicle
break-in instructions contained in the applicable vehicle owner's manual, if any.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The manufacturer shall accumulate mileage at a minimum rate of 300 miles per vehicle during each 24-hour period,
unless otherwise provided by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The first 24-hour period for mileage accumulation shall begin as soon as authorized vehicle checks, inspections
and preparations are completed on each vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The minimum mileage accumulation rate does not apply on weekends or holidays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the manufacturer's mileage accumulation target is less than the minimum rate specified (300 miles per day),
then the minimum daily accumulation rate shall be equal to the manufacturer's mileage accumulation target.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Mileage accumulation shall be completed on a sufficient number of test vehicles during consecutive 24-hour periods
to assure that the number of vehicles tested per day fulfills the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The manufacturer shall not perform any maintenance on test vehicles after selection for testing nor shall the
Administrator allow deletion of any test vehicle from the test sequence, unless requested by the manufacturer and
approved by the Administrator before any test vehicle maintenance of deletion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Initial test results are calculated following the test procedures specified in &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a). Round
the initial test results to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed
to one additional significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved 1980) (as
referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28 (a)(4)(i)(B)(

).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final test results for each test vehicle are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph
(a) of this section for each test vehicle, dividing by the number of times that specific test has been conducted on the
vehicle, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional
significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
For each test vehicle.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final deteriorated test results for each light-duty vehicle tested for exhaust emissions and/or refueling emissions
according to subpart B or subpart C of this part are calculated by multiplying or adding the final test results by the
appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process for the engine or evaporative/refueling
family and model year to which the selected configuration belongs and rounding to the same number of decimal places
contained in the applicable emission standard. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved
1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

)(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). For the purpose of this paragraph, if a multiplicative deterioration factor as computed during the certification
process is less than one, that deterioration factor shall be one. If an additive deterioration factor as computed
during the certification process is less than zero, that deterioration factor will be zero.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no deterioration factors for light-duty vehicle emissions obtained during testing in accordance with
subpart O of this part or with &sect;86.146&hyph;96. Accordingly, for the CST and the fuel dispensing spitback test
the term ``final deteriorated test results'' means the final test results derived in paragraph (b) of this section
for each test vehicle, rounded to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard.
Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67, (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28

(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass/fail criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The manufacturer shall test vehicles comprising the test sample until a pass decision is reached for all of the pollutants
associated with all of the test procedures pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a) or a fail decision is reached for
one of these pollutants. A pass decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles, as defined in paragraph
(b) of this section, for each pollutant is less than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative
number of vehicles tested. A fail decision is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles for one pollutant
is greater than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass
and fail decision numbers associated with the cumulative number of vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables
in appendix XI of this part appropriate for the annual projected sales as made by the manufacturer in its report submitted
under &sect;600.207&hyph;80(a)(2) of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix
XI of this part, sampling plan ``stage'' refers to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. Once a pass decision has
been made for a particular pollutant associated with a particular test procedure pursuant to &sect;86.608&hyph;98(a),
the number of vehicles whose final deteriorated test results exceed the emission standard for that pollutant may
not be considered any further for purposes of the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) CST criteria only. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass or fail decision is determined according to the
pass/fail criteria described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each vehicle, the CST in its entirety
is considered one pollutant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is made on the last vehicle required to make a decision
under paragraph (c) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1)(i) For heavy-duty engines, the prescribed test procedure is the Federal Test Procedure as described in subparts
N, I, and P of this part. The Administrator, may on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional
test procedures other than those in subparts N, I, and P of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is not susceptible
to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subparts N, I, and P of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) For heavy-duty vehicles the prescribed test procedures are the Fuel Dispensing Spitback Test as described in
&sect;86.1246&hyph;96 (for HDVs with a GVW of less than 14,000 pounds (6,400 kilograms)); this test for fuel spitback
is conducted as a stand alone test, thus all references to the test sequence described in figure M96&hyph;1 of subpart
M of this part can be ignored. Further, the Administrator may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer,
approve optional test procedures other than those in subpart M of this part for any heavy-duty vehicle which is not
susceptible to satisfactory testing using the procedures in subpart M of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For light-duty trucks, the prescribed test procedures are the Federal Test Procedure, including the refueling
test procedure or the fuel spitback test, whichever is applicable, as described in subpart B of this part, the idle
test procedure as described in subpart P of this part, the cold temperature CO test procedure as described in subpart
C of this part, and the Certification Short Test as described in subpart O of this part. For purposes of Selective Enforcement
Audit Testing, the manufacturer shall not be required to perform any of the test procedures in subpart B of this part
relating to evaporative emission testing, other than refueling emissions testing, except as specified in paragraph
(a)(3) of this section. The Administrator may select and prescribe the sequence of any CSTs. Further, the Administrator
may, on the basis of a written application by a manufacturer, approve optional test procedures other than those in
subparts B, C, P, and O of this part for any motor vehicle which is not susceptible to satisfactory testing using the
procedures in subparts B, C, P, and O of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When testing light-duty trucks, the following exceptions to the test procedures in subpart B of this part are applicable
to Selective Enforcement Audit testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For mileage accumulation, the manufacturer may use test fuel meeting the specifications for mileage and service
accumulation fuels of &sect;86.113&hyph;94. Otherwise, the manufacturer may use fuels other than those specified
in this section only with the advance approval of the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The manufacturer may measure the temperature of the test fuel at other than the approximate mid-volume of the
fuel tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(a) with only a single temperature sensor, and may drain the test
fuel from other than the lowest point of the tank, as specified in &sect;86.131&hyph;96(b) and &sect;86.152&hyph;98(a),
provided an equivalent method is used. Equivalency documentation shall be maintained by the manufacturer and shall

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The manufacturer may perform additional preconditioning on SEA test vehicles other than the preconditioning
specified in &sect;86.132&hyph;96 only in the additional preconditioning had been performed on certification
test vehicles of the same configuration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described
in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the manufacturer shall perform the heat build procedure 11 to 34 hours following vehicle
preconditioning rather than according to the time period specified in &sect;86.133&hyph;90(a). All references
to an evaporative emission enclosure and analyzing for HC during the heat build can be ignored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph
&sect;86.135&hyph;90(e): 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the slave tires are the same size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described
in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the cold start exhaust emission test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96 shall follow
the heat build procedure described in &sect;86.133&hyph;90 by not more than one hour.

of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers
is placed in the standby position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in the sample collection bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) The manufacturer need not comply with &sect;86.142&hyph;90 or &sect;86.155&hyph;98, since the records
required therein are provided under other provisions of this subpart K. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(3)(xi)
of this section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test procedure, the elapsed time between the initial
and final FID readings shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98(e)(8).
In addition, the vehicle soak described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and luggage
compartment of the vehicle open. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b), of both integrated
and non-integrated systems instead of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, a manufacturer
may conduct the canister purge described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning
drive described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to perform the following background emissions determination
immediately prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98, provided EPA is notified
of this decision prior to the start of testing in an SEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior to the background determination. Warning: If at
any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the
enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the background determination.
If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel mixing blower shall be turned on at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level encountered by the test vehicle during the entire
background emissions determination shall be 80

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The windows and luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be secured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the
initial background hydrocarbon concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 minute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the end of the background
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon
concentration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background determination is calculated according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98.
To obtain a per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass calculated in this paragraph
by the duration of the soak, rounded to the nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(3)(xi)(G) of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph
(a)(3)(ix) of this section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of emissions calculated for the refueling
test according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The final
results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall be computed by dividing the adjusted value for
total refueling mass emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test as described in &sect;86.156&hyph;98(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and
methanol-fueled vehicles as follows prior to emission testing: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere

addition, deletion, or substitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) The manufacturer shall not adjust, repair, prepare, or modify the vehicles selected for testing and shall
not perform any emission tests on vehicles selected for testing pursuant to the test order unless this adjustment
repair, preparation, modification, and/or tests are documented in the manufacturer's vehicle assembly and inspection
procedures and are actually performed or unless these adjustments and/or tests are required or permitted under this
subpart or are approved in advance by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For 1984 and later model years the Administrator may adjust or cause to be adjusted any engine or vehicle parameter
which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment for certification, Selective Enforcement Audit
testing, and Production Compliance Audit testing in accordance with &sect;86.090&hyph;22(c)(1), to any setting
within the physically adjustable range of that parameter, as determined by the Administrator in accordance with
&sect;86.090&hyph;22(e)(3)(ii), prior to the performance of any tests. However, if the idle speed parameter is
one which the Administrator has determined to be subject to adjustment, the Administrator shall not adjust it to a
setting which causes a lower engine idle speed than will be possible within the physically adjustable range of the
idle speed parameter if the manufacturer had accumulated 125 hours of service on the engine or 4,000 miles on the vehicle
under paragraph (c) of this section, all other parameters being identically adjusted for the purpose of comparison.
The manufacturer may be requested to supply information to establish such an alternative minimum idle speed. The
Administrator, in making or specifying such adjustments, will consider the effect of the deviation from the manufacturer's
recommended setting on emissions performance characteristics as well as the likelihood that similar settings will
occur on in-use heavy-duty engines or light-duty trucks. In determining likelihood, the Administrator will consider
factors such as, but not limited to, the effect of the adjustment on engine or vehicle performance characteristics
and surveillance information from similar in-use vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Prior to performing emission testing on an SEA test engine, the manufacturer may accumulate on each engine a number
of hours of service equal to the greater of 125 hours or the number of hours the manufacturer accumulated during certification

Calculation and reporting of test results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Initial test results are calculated following the Federal Test Procedure specified in &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a).
Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28

) to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant
figure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section
for each test vehicle or engine, dividing by the number of times that specific test has been conducted on the vehicle
or engine, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one
additional significant figure. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced
in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)(

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final deteriorated test results. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The final deteriorated test results for each light-duty truck, heavy-duty engine, or heavy-duty vehicle tested
according to subpart B, C, D, I, M, N, or P of this part are calculated by multiplying or adding the final test results
by the appropriate deterioration factor derived from the certification process for the engine or evaporative/refueling
family and model year to which the selected configuration belongs. For the purpose of this paragraph, if a multiplicative
deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is less than one, that deterioration factor shall
be one. If an additive deterioration factor as computed during the certification process is less than zero, that deterioration
factor will be zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exceptions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no deterioration factors for light-duty truck emissions obtained during testing in accordance with subpart
O of this part or with &sect;86.146&hyph;96. Accordingly, for the CST and the fuel dispensing spitback test the term
``final deteriorated test results'' means the final test results derived in paragraph (b) of this section for each
test vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The final deteriorated test results obtained in paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section are rounded to the same
number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard. Rounding is done in accordance with ASTM
E 29&hyph;67 (reapproved 1980) (as referenced in &sect;86.094&hyph;28(a)(4)(i)(B)(

Compliance with acceptable quality level and passing and failing criteria for Selective Enforcement Audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The prescribed acceptable quality level is 40 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A failed vehicle or engine is one whose final deteriorated test results pursuant to &sect;86.1009&hyph;2001(c)
exceed at least one of the applicable emission standards associated with the test procedures pursuant to &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass/fail criteria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The manufacturer shall test light-duty trucks, heavy-duty engines, or heavy-duty vehicles comprising the test
sample until a pass decision is reached for all of the pollutants associated with all of the test procedures pursuant
to &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a) or a fail decision is reached for one of these pollutants. A pass decision is reached
when the cumulative number of failed vehicles or engines, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, for each pollutant
is less than or equal to the fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. A fail decision
is reached when the cumulative number of failed vehicles or engines for one pollutant is greater than or equal to the
fail decision number appropriate to the cumulative number of vehicles tested. The pass and fail decision numbers
associated with the cumulative number of vehicles tested are determined by use of the tables in appendix X of this part
appropriate to the projected sales as made by the heavy-duty engine or heavy-duty vehicle manufacturer in its Application
for Certification, or as made by the light-duty truck manufacturer in its report submitted under &sect;600.207&hyph;80(a)(2)
of this chapter (Automobile Fuel Economy Regulations). In the tables in appendix X of this part, sampling plan ``stage''
refers to the cumulative number of vehicles or engines tested. Once a pass decision has been made for a particular pollutant
associated with a particular test procedure pursuant to &sect;86.1008&hyph;2001(a), the number of vehicles or
engines whose final deteriorated test results exceed the emission standard for that pollutant may not be considered
any further for purposes of the audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CST criteria only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For CST testing pursuant to subpart O, a pass or fail decision is determined according to the pass/fail criteria described
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, except that for each vehicle, the CST in its entirety is considered one pollutant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Passing or failing of an SEA audit occurs when the decision is made on the last vehicle or engine required to make
a decision under paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in paragraph (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In December 1975, during the aftermath of the energy crisis created by the oil embargo of 1973&hyph;74, Congress enacted
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Congress included a provision in that Act establishing an automotive fuel
economy regulatory program. That provision added a new title, title V, ``Improving Automotive Efficiency,'' to
the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Saving Act (the Act). Title V provides for the establishment of average fuel
economy standards for cars and light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(b) of the Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue light truck fuel economy standards for
each model year. Standards are required to be set at least 18 months prior to the beginning of the model year. The Act
provides that the fuel economy standards are to be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In determining
maximum feasible average fuel economy level, the Secretary is required under section 502(e) of the Act to consider
four factors: technological feasibility; economic practicability; the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards
on fuel economy; and the need of the nation to conserve energy. (Responsibility for the automotive fuel economy program
was delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Administrator of NHTSA (41 FR 25015, June 22, 1976)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 8, 1991, NHTSA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 50694) a questionnaire concerning fuel economy standards for MYs 1995&hyph;1997. The comments received in
response to the questionnaire are available in Docket No. 91&hyph;50.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After analyzing the responses to the questionnaire and reviewing other available data, NHTSA published a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing average fuel economy standards for light trucks for MYs 1995&hyph;97. 57
FR 61377 (December 24, 1992). The agency proposed to select the standards from within a range of 20.5&hyph;21.0 mpg
for MY 1995, and 20.5&hyph;21.5 mpg for MYs 1996 and 1997. These ranges were based on the agency's tentative evaluation
of manufacturer capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the December 24, 1992 NPRM, the agency received comments from General Motors (GM), Ford, Chrysler,
the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA, formerly the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association),
Rover Group, the National Automobile Dealers Association, and about 50 organizations concerned about the continuing
availability to consumers of a full range of light trucks, including, among others, the Coalition for Vehicle Choice,
Consumer Alert, and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). The issues raised by the commenters are addressed
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 7, 1993, the agency published a final rule establishing a 20.6 mpg combined average fuel economy standard
for light trucks manufactured in MY 1995 (58 FR 18019). The limited time then available to promulgate a final rule for
MY 1995 precluded a thorough consideration of the issues related to light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996&hyph;97.
Therefore, NHTSA announced that it would reach a decision later with respect to the light truck standard for those
model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to publication of the final rule establishing the CAFE standard for MY 1995, NHTSA received another comment
from Ford, in which the manufacturer revised some of the risks and opportunities it believed it faced in MYs 1996&hyph;97.
This resulted in revised CAFE projections for those years. The Department also received a letter from the Energy Conservation
Coalition (ECC) recommending that light truck CAFE for those years be sharply increased. ECC's letter was signed
by ECC, itself, as well as the Environmental &amp; Energy Study Institute, Public Citizen, Sierra Club, American
Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, Center for Auto Safety, and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.

II. Summary of Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its analysis, the agency is establishing a combined average fuel economy standard for MYs 1996 and 1997 at
20.7 mpg. The agency notes that the relatively short leadtime for MYs 1996&hyph;97 precludes significant technological
changes beyond that which manufacturers have already planned. Given the continuing need to conserve energy, as discussed
elsewhere in this notice, and the increasing ratio of light truck to passenger car sales, NHTSA desires to insure that
feasible light truck CAFE improvements will continue to be made. To achieve this goal, the agency has published an
ANPRM in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 addressing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1998&hyph;2006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is eliminating the requirement that captive imports and other light trucks be required to meet CAFE standards
separately. Beginning in MY 1996, there will be a combined standard that will apply to each manufacturer's light truck
fleet in its entirety.

III. Manufacturer Capabilities for MYs 1996&hyph;97 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating manufacturers' fuel economy capabilities for MYs 1996&hyph;97, the agency has analyzed manufacturers'
current projections and underlying product plans and has considered what, if any, additional actions the manufacturers
could take to improve their fuel economy. A more detailed discussion of these issues is contained in the agency's Regulatory
Evaluation, which is being placed in the docket for this notice. Some of the information included in the Regulatory
Evaluation, including the details of manufacturers' future product plans, has been determined by the agency to be
confidential business information whose release could cause competitive harm. The public version of the Regulatory
Evaluation omits the confidential information.

1. General Motors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the NPRM, General Motors (GM) projected in December 1991 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level
of 20.7 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97. In its February 1993 comment on the NPRM, GM revised its projection slightly downward,
to 20.5 mpg. By comparison, in a mid-model year report submitted in July 1992, GM projected a MY 1992 CAFE of 20.2 mpg.
In its mid-model year report submitted in July 1993, it projected a MY 1993 CAFE of 19.8 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM stated in its February 1993 comment that the light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 ``should be set no higher
than 20.5 mpg, and even that may be too high.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford projected in January 1992 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.6 mpg for MY 1996, and 21.5 mpg for
MY 1997. These projections were revised by Ford in a May 1993 letter updating its comment to the NPRM, which stated that,
after re-evaluating the risks and opportunities it faced in those model years, it could achieve a light truck CAFE
level of 21.1 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.6 mpg in MY 1997. Ford stated that the risk factors could reduce its CAFE level for MY
1996 to as low as 20.8 mpg, and for MY 1997 to 21.0 mpg. By comparison, in its final model year data submitted to the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), Ford reported a MY 1992 CAFE of 20.3 mpg. In its mid-model year report submitted to NHTSA in
July 1993, that company projected a MY 1993 CAFE of 20.7 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford recommended in its comment on the NPRM that the agency establish the MY 1996 standard at the same level as the MY
1994 standard, 20.5 mpg. It commented that the agency could raise the MY 1997 standard to a level no higher than 21.0
mpg.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Chrysler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chrysler projected in December 1991 that it could achieve a light truck CAFE level of 21.0 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97.
In its January 1993 comment on the NPRM, Chrysler revised its projection slightly downward, to 20.8 mpg for MY 1996
and 20.9 mpg for MY 1997. By way of comparison, Chrysler achieved a CAFE level of 21.2 mpg for MY 1992 according to its
final model year data as reported to the EPA, and projected a CAFE level of 21.0 mpg for MY 1993 in its July 1993 mid-model
year report to NHTSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler commented that it supports a standard of 20.5 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97 because it does not anticipate any
major improvements in light truck fuel economy through new technological applications.

4. Other Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle portion of the light
truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those three companies. By way of example,
in their mid-model year reports for 1993, Toyota projected a light truck CAFE of 21.8 mpg, Isuzu 21.8 mpg, Mazda 23.6
mpg, Mitsubishi 21.2 mpg, Subaru 29.1 mpg, Suzuki 28.9 mpg, and Volkswagen 21.0 mpg.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA noted that two companies, Range Rover and PAS, projected MY 1992 light truck CAFE levels that are
well below those of the large domestic manufacturers. In their mid-model year reports for MY 1992, Range Rover projected
a CAFE level of 16.3 mpg and PAS 18.6 mpg. The agency notes that in their mid-model year reports for MY 1993, Range Rover
projected a CAFE level of 15.4 mpg and PAS 18.5 mpg. Both of these companies sell a small number of light trucks in the
U.S., on the order of about 5,000 vehicles or less. PAS modifies GM light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One other company which has a CAFE capability below that of the large domestic manufacturers is UMC, a small domestic
producer of delivery vans. That company projects selling 950 light trucks in MY 1993, with a CAFE of 18.8 mpg.

B. Possible Additional Actions To Improve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency analyzed the additional actions which manufacturers may be able to take to improve their CAFE levels above
those that they currently project for MYs 1996&hyph;97. These actions may be divided into two categories: further
technological changes and product restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Further Technological Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ability to improve CAFE by further technological changes to product plans is dependent on the availability of
fuel efficiency enhancing technologies that manufacturers are able to apply within the available time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's Regulatory Evaluation discusses the fuel efficiency enhancing technologies which are expected to
be available by MYs 1996&hyph;97. However, for MYs 1996&hyph;97, limited leadtime is a significant constraint on
the increased use of these technologies. NHTSA recognizes that the leadtime necessary to implement significant
improvements in engines, transmissions, aerodynamics and rolling resistance is typically at least three years.
Also, as the agency discussed in establishing its final rule for MYs 1993&hyph;94, once a new design is established
and tested as feasible for production, the leadtime necessary to design tools and test components is typically 30
to 36 months. Some potential major changes may take even longer. Leadtimes for new vehicles are usually at least three
years. Further, light trucks have a long model life, i.e., 8&hyph;10 years or more. If a manufacturer must make a major
model change ahead of its normal schedule, this change may have a significant, unprogrammed financial impact. NHTSA
notes that AAMA stated in its comment that the above leadtimes, which the agency cited in the NPRM, are more typical
for passenger cars and that truck leadtimes are even longer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the leadtime constraint, the agency does not believe that manufacturers can achieve significant improvements
in their projected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels by additional technological actions.

2. Product Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to technological improvements, manufacturers could improve their CAFE by restricting their product
offerings, e.g., limiting or deleting production of particular larger light truck models and larger displacement
engines. Such product restrictions, if made necessary by selection of a CAFE standard that is above manufacturers'
capabilities, could result in adverse economic impacts on the industry and the economy as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop an independent indicator of the potential impacts of a standard that could be met only by product restrictions,
the agency estimated the loss of production associated with sufficient production restrictions by GM to raise its
CAFE by 0.5 mpg. To estimate this effect, the agency eliminated production of GM's least fuel efficient models until
the desired improvement in CAFE was achieved. NHTSA stated in the NPRM that this approach tends to yield the maximum
possible negative impacts, because it does not include the possibility of consumers accepting a smaller truck or
engine, or switching to vehicles over 8500 pounds GVWR. Also, it ignores the possibility of additional technological
improvements to these truck fleets, or compliance through the use of credits earned in other model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For MY 1996, the NHTSA analysis indicates that to increase its CAFE by 0.5 mpg by restricting sales, GM could suffer
a sales loss of up to 151,000 units of its projected light truck production for that year. The potential job losses under
this scenario in manufacturer and supplier industries could total roughly 25,000. For MY 1997, a similar increase
in CAFE of 0.5 mpg could cause GM a sales loss of up to 142,000 units, with a concurrent potential loss to the industry
of nearly 24,000 jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM commented that it takes issue with NHTSA's statement that its analysis of job losses is necessarily an upper bound.
That company stated that it could be that a manufacturer's product restrictions would not be done by eliminating the
least fuel efficient vehicles first from its CAFE fleet, but a manufacturer could instead choose to restrict products
based not only on their fuel efficiency but also their profit contributions. GM stated that this strategy could lead
to larger lost sales and jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the considerations discussed above, NHTSA concludes that significant product restrictions should not be
considered as part of manufacturers' capabilities to improve their MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Manufacturer-Specific CAFE Capabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed later in this notice, NHTSA takes ``industrywide considerations'' into account in setting fuel economy
standards. In carrying this out, the agency has traditionally focused on the least capable manufacturer with a substantial
share of light truck sales. For MYs 1996&hyph;97, the agency has determined that GM is the least capable manufacturer
with a substantial share of sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, GM currently projects its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE level at 20.5 mpg. It has also identified
certain risks related to technology and mix which it says could reduce its CAFE level by as much as 0.5 mpg in MY 1996 and
0.3 mpg in MY 1997. As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, however, the agency has analyzed these potential risks
and believes that they are unlikely to have as large an effect as GM believes. In addition, GM has identified an additional
product action it is considering which could also reduce its CAFE. However, NHTSA believes the issues of whether GM
will actually take the product action, and if so, what the fleet penetration would be for MYs 1996&hyph;97, are too
speculative to justify an adjustment to GM's CAFE capability. NHTSA notes that it is not identifying the product action
because it is confidential business information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After carefully evaluating GM's product plan, NHTSA believes that company is capable of achieving a light truck CAFE
of 20.7 mpg in both MYs 1996 and 1997. The factors explaining the difference between GM's projection and the agency's
estimate of its capability are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, as discussed in the NPRM, GM projects that a much larger portion of its MYs 1996&hyph;97 fleet will have four-wheel
drive (4WD) than it has had in recent years, or than its competitors are projecting. The agency stated in the NPRM that
it is not aware of any reason to expect that the 4WD market will continue to increase. NHTSA also stated that it believes
there are alternatives to 4WD, including traction control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM commented that it believes its forecast of MYs 1996&hyph;97 4WD penetration is realistic, stating that competitors'
actions in the 4WD segments, the use of all-wheel drive configurations and market data for future years support its
projections. GM also argued that traction control is not an alternative to 4WD trucks since it has little benefit for
off-road applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency continues to believe that it is unlikely that the 4WD market share will increase appreciably for the fleet
in general, or for GM in particular, over the timeframe between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97. Since the mid-1980's, the
4WD share of total light truck sales for each model year has consistently been within the range of 32&hyph;35 percent.
No data have been presented to the agency which demonstrate that this share will significantly change by MYs 1996&hyph;97.
The agency notes that, while it agrees that traction control isn't an alternative to 4WD for off-road applications,
it would be a reasonable alternative for on-road use for many consumers. No evidence has been presented to the agency
which shows that there will be increased need or demand for more 4WD or off-road vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, since NHTSA believes that GM's MYs 1996 and 1997 product plans overstate
the percentage of 4WD vehicles that it will sell, the agency has adjusted that company's CAFE projections to reflect
what it believes is a more realistic share. In making this adjustment, the agency assumed that GM's 4WD percentage
for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will be the same as for MY 1993, the model year in which GM had its highest 4WD share ever. NHTSA also
refined the analysis presented in the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis (PRIA) to more accurately reflect
the particular vehicles that GM is likely to sell more of and less of. With this adjustment, and assuming that the 4WD
share of GM's light truck fleet for MYs 1996&hyph;97 is consistent with both that company's and its competitors' historical
levels, its CAFE would be more than 0.1 mpg higher in MY 1996, although it would be less than half that amount higher in
MY 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA stated in the NPRM that the GM fleet leads the other manufacturers in every engine performance calculation carried
out by the agency and that GM's performance levels are detrimental to its fuel economy performance. The agency indicated,
for example, that if GM's light truck fleet for MY 1995 were closer to the values achieved by other manufacturers for
the various performance measurements, GM's CAFE values in that model year might be improved by between 0.3 and 0.4
mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM commented that it disagrees with the agency's assessment in the NPRM that GM's CAFE could be boosted 0.4 mpg by lowering
engine performance. That company stated that it believes that NHTSA's performance adjustment was based on an incorrect
sales weighted analysis of GM's performance levels compared to its competitors. GM stated that a manufacturer's
average performance level, like many other vehicle attributes such as average weight or engine displacement, is
a function of the mix it sells. That company stated that when its mix is compared to its competitors' mix, GM's performance
levels do not appear to be out of line with other manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, the agency has evaluated GM's comment concerning comparative performance
levels. NHTSA has also reviewed revised MYs 1996&hyph;97 fleet projections submitted by GM and Ford, which resulted
in reduced fleet average values for almost all performance measures. In light of these adjustments, NHTSA has concluded
that the performance level of the GM fleet is only slightly greater than its competitors and that GM can make a small
improvement in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE by bringing its performance levels more in line with its competitors.
The value of a CAFE adjustment if GM were to reach comparable levels of performance would be nearly 0.2 mpg in both MYs
1996 and 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that there are few other opportunities available to GM to make small improvements in its MYs 1996&hyph;97
light truck CAFE. There is little time left before the start of the MY 1996 production in, roughly, July 1995. It is unlikely
that GM can make any significant technological change to its products to increase its average fuel economy in this
period, and the agency is unable to discern any technology plans for MY 1997 that might be pulled ahead for earlier introduction
in MY 1996. The additional leadtime before MY 1997 production begins may allow for some minor technological improvements.
The agency estimates that these could increase GM's CAFE by up to 0.1 mpg in MY 1997.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GM faces certain technological risks during MYs 1996&hyph;97 that could lower its CAFE in those model years. Based
on its evaluation of information submitted by GM, NHTSA estimates that these risks could decrease GM's MYs 1996&hyph;97
CAFE by more than 0.1 mpg in each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By adjusting GM's MYs 1996 and 1997 product plans to reflect all of the factors stated above, NHTSA has concluded that
GM is capable of achieving a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both model years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, Ford currently projects its MY 1996 light truck CAFE level at 21.1 mpg, and its MY 1997 light truck
CAFE level at 21.6 mpg. It has also identified certain volume sales and technological risks which it says could reduce
its CAFE level by as much as 0.3 mpg in MY 1996 and 0.6 mpg in MY 1997. Ford has also identified several opportunities which
could slightly increase its CAFE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated the risks and opportunities identified by Ford, as
well as other means that may be available to Ford to improve its CAFE. The agency believes that Ford overstates the risks
that can reasonably be expected to occur in both years. NHTSA expects the risks that negatively affect Ford's CAFE
to be offset by sufficient opportunities to result in a capability of 21.2 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.6 mpg in MY 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Chrysler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated above, Chrysler currently projects its MY 1996 light truck CAFE level at 20.8 mpg, and its MY 1997 light
truck CAFE level at 20.9 mpg. After evaluating Chrysler's product plan, NHTSA has concluded that Chrysler can achieve
CAFE levels of at least 20.8 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.0 mpg in MY 1997. The agency believes that the additional leadtime available
before MY 1997 vehicles begin production may allow Chrysler to make technological refinements or improvements,
or to move certain planned improvements forward to MY 1997. This could increase Chrysler's MY 1997 CAFE by up to 0.1
mpg, thus allowing the company to attain a CAFE level of 21.0 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NHTSA has focused its analysis on GM, the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales, the agency
does not believe that company's capability is significantly below that of Chrysler, although it is well below that
of Ford. As indicated above, the agency believes that Ford has the capability to achieve a MY 1996 CAFE of 21.2 mpg and
a MY 1997 CAFE of 21.6 mpg, and that Chrysler can achieve a MY 1996 CAFE of 20.8 mpg and a MY 1997 CAFE of 21.0 mpg. The agency
believes that the ability of Ford and Chrysler to improve their CAFE levels above their projections is small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency must, therefore, disagree, with the comment received from ECC that argued that CAFE levels of 23 mpg in MY
1996 and 24 mpg in MY 1997 would be within the capability of manufacturers. The ECC cited a study of fuel economy by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The study, which was jointly commissioned by NHTSA and the Federal Highway Administration
in 1991, stated that a 22 mpg CAFE standard would be within manufacturers' capabilities. ECC also cited ``best-in-class''
analysis performed by the EPA, purportedly showing that light trucks could achieve a 24.3 mpg CAFE level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ECC failed to address the agency's discussion of the limitations of the NAS study in the NPRM (see 57 FR 61384), which
noted that the methodology used by the NAS in its study ``has little relevance as a reference value for this rulemaking.''
The figure used by the NAS in reaching its conclusion that a 22 mpg level was possible in MY 1996 was intended to represent
the entire light truck fleet, and not the capability of one or two manufacturers with a significant share of the market.
As NHTSA has noted, individual large manufacturers may have light truck fleets with a mix toward larger, less fuel
efficient trucks that have the effect of lowering their overall CAFE. In addition, the model mix used in the study was
derived from EPA preliminary data for MY 1990, and did not bear a close relationship to the actual mix produced in MY
1991, much less the projected mix for MY 1996. Nor did the study include large vans and utility vehicles, which are a
significant segment of the light truck market, and have lower fuel economy levels. The agency stated in the NPRM that
it could not use the NAS study as a blueprint for setting CAFE standards, and ECC did not rebut the agency's statement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The best-in-class analysis does not take into account sales or popularity in the market. Most vehicles that get best-in-class
fuel economy ratings have the poorest sales in their class as well. NHTSA cannot force consumers to buy best-in-class
light trucks, which often suffer from the disadvantage that they do not possess the power, room, or other attributes
that light truck purchasers find desirable. Nor, given the very short leadtime between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97,
would manufacturers have the chance to redesign their light trucks to more closely be capable of achieving best-in-class
fuel economy levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its own analysis and in light of the lack of evidence presented by ECC, the agency rejects that commenter's
argument that CAFE levels of 23 mpg in MY 1996 and 24 mpg in MY 1997 would be within manufacturers' capabilities.

In determining the maximum feasible fuel economy level, the agency must take into consideration the potential effects

completed, that may have an impact on fuel economy capability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated several safety rulemakings for their potential impacts
on light truck fuel economy in MYs 1996&hyph;97. These include revisions to FMVSS Nos. 208, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1. FMVSS 208 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 26, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 12472) a final rule requiring automatic restraints on trucks with a gross
vehicle weight rating of 8500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5500 pounds or less. These requirements
phase in at the following rate for each manufacturer: 20 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1994
to August 31, 1995; 50 percent of light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 1996; 90 percent of
light trucks manufactured from September 1, 1996 to August 31, 1997; and all light trucks manufactured on or after
September 1, 1997. Thus, the requirement will affect 50 percent of MY 1996 light trucks and 90 percent of MY 1997 light
trucks. Although light truck manufacturers may comply, as passenger car manufacturers have in the past, with the
automatic restraint requirements by using automatic belts or air bags, NHTSA expects that essentially all light
truck manufacturers will comply by using air bags. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage the use of more innovative automatic restraint systems (primarily air bags) in light trucks, during
the first four years of the phase-in (i.e., through MY 1998) manufacturers may count each light truck equipped with
such a restraint system for the driver's position, and a dynamically tested manual safety belt for the right-front
passenger's position, as a vehicle complying with the automatic restraint requirements. Beginning with MY 1999,
however, all light trucks are required to provide automatic restraints for both the driver and right-front passenger
positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to amend its automatic restraint
requirements to mandate that 80 percent of MY 1998, and all MY 1999 light trucks be equipped with driver and passenger-side
air bags. On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 46551) to implement this requirement. Since NHTSA expects that essentially all manufacturers will rely on
air bags for compliance with the light truck automatic restraints requirements, this provision should have a negligible
substantive impact, and will not affect MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis for the 1991 light truck automatic restrain rulemaking, which is available
in the public docket at NHTSA, the agency estimated weight increases per vehicle ranging from 15.3 pounds for a driver's-side
air bag to 35.7 pounds for both driver and right-front passenger air bags (including ``secondary weight,'' i.e.,
weight added for supporting structure, etc.). Using these figures, NHTSA estimated that fuel economy could be reduced
by about 0.05 to 0.11 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The automatic restraint weight estimates provided by the manufacturers in their responses to the Request for Comments,
and the NPRM for this rulemaking were generally consistent with those previously developed by the agency. NHTSA calculates
that the manufacturers' estimates translate into fuel economy penalties of 0.07&hyph;0.12 mpg for MY 1996 and 0.11&hyph;0.14
mpg for MY 1997. These weight effects are reflected in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections, so there is no
need for NHTSA to add an explicit adjustment to their projections to consider the impact of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. FMVSS 214
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 14, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 27427) a final rule extending the ``quasi-static'' test requirements of FMVSS
214 to trucks, multipurpose vehicles, and buses with a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or less. On July 13, 1992, NHTSA published
(57 FR 30917) a final rule establishing a brief phase-in for the requirements of this rule. Manufacturers must meet
the requirements for all of their light trucks as of September 1, 1994. The ``quasi-static'' requirements have the
effect of requiring each side door to be designed to mitigate occupant injuries in side impacts. It measures performance
in terms of the ability of each door to resist a piston pressing a rigid steel cylinder against it. Manufacturers generally
comply with the standard by reinforcing the side doors with metal beams or rods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Regulatory Evaluation accompanying the rule, NHTSA estimated that the requirements of FMVSS 214 would result
in an average weight increase of 24.8 to 26.7 pounds (including secondary weight). This weight increase could result
in a fuel economy degradation of 0.1 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The weight estimates provided by the manufacturers for quasi-static side impact protection translate, according
to NHTSA calculations, into fuel economy penalties of approximately 0.04&hyph;0.07 mpg for each model year, MYs
1996 and 1997. These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections, so there is no need
for NHTSA to add an explicit adjustment to their projections to consider the impact of this standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also considering other regulatory requirements to protect light truck occupants in side impacts. The
agency addressed a number of possible requirements in an ANPRM published on August 19, 1988 (53 FR 31716). In addition,
on June 5, 1992, pursuant to the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, NHTSA published (57 FR
24009) an ANPRM concerning whether passenger car dynamic side impact protection requirements should be extended
to light trucks. Since any additional requirements in this area would take effect after MY 1997, there will be no impact
on MYs 1996&hyph;97 fuel economy capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. FMVSS 216
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 17, 1991, NHTSA published a final rule (56 FR 15510) amending FMVSS 216, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Roof Crush Resistance, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to extend its requirements to light trucks with GVWRs of 6,000 pounds or less. Previously, the standard applied only
to passenger cars. The effective date of the rule is September 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FMVSS 216 is intended to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger compartment in
rollover crashes. This standard established strength requirements for the forward portion of the roof to increase
the resistance of the roof to intrusion and crush. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that this requirement will have a negligible impact on light truck manufacturers' MYs 1996&hyph;97
fuel economy capabilities. Most light trucks already meet the standard. NHTSA calculates that the manufacturers'
weight impact estimates translate into fuel economy penalties of about 0.003&hyph;0.030 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97.
These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy projections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. FMVSS 108
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 19, 1991, NHTSA published (56 FR 16015) a final rule requiring new light trucks to be equipped with center high-mounted
stoplamps (CHMSLs). The effective date was September 1, 1993. With an estimated weight effect of about one pound,
this rule has a negligible CAFE effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. FMVSS 201
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 8, 1993, NHTSA published (58 FR 7506) a notice proposing to amend FMVSS 201 to require passenger cars and
light trucks to meet a new in-vehicle component test to provide protection when an occupant's head impacts upper interior
components (such as A-pillars and side rails) during a crash. The estimated weight effect for light trucks for this
proposed requirement averages six to nine pounds per vehicle, for a fuel economy effect of 0.03 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, it is still indeterminate as to whether the proposed requirement will affect light trucks in MYs 1996&hyph;97.
At this time, therefore, the agency cannot take potential fuel economy effects into consideration when establishing
fuel economy standards for MYs 1996&hyph;97.

6. Rollover Prevention
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required NHTSA to publish an ANPRM or NPRM by May 31,
1992 to provide ``protection against unreasonable risk of rollovers of passenger cars, multipurpose passenger
vehicles, and trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating of 8,500 pounds or less and an unloaded vehicle weight of 5,500
pounds or less.'' On January 3, 1992, NHTSA published (57 FR 242) an ANPRM announcing that the agency is considering
whether to propose a safety standard to reduce the casualties associated with rollovers of passenger cars, pickup
trucks, vans, and utility vehicles. In addition, on September 29, 1992, NHTSA published a notice (57 FR 44721) announcing
the availability of a document describing the agency's planned rulemaking effort, data analyses, and physical research
to address the problem of rollover crashes and resulting injuries and fatalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since NHTSA has not yet proposed any requirements in this area, it will not have an impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE capabilities.

B. Revised Emissions Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) impose more stringent exhaust emissions standards on light trucks. Standards
are also becoming tighter in California. Under the CAAA, new standards for light trucks with GVWRs up to 6,000 pounds
have begun phasing-in. The phase-in provides for compliance by 40 percent for MY 1994, 80 percent for MY 1995, and 100
percent for MY 1996 and afterwards. For light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR, more stringent standards begin to take
effect in MY 1996. Fifty percent of these vehicles must comply with the new standards in MY 1996; all light trucks over
6,000 pounds GVWR must meet the new standards for MY 1997 and later.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current standards for exhaust emissions will tighten substantially under the CAAA. Over the ``full useful life''
of a vehicle, emissions standards will be 0.80 grams/mile for total hydrocarbons, and will range (depending on vehicle
and test weight) from 0.31 to 0.56 grams/mile for non-methane hydrocarbons, from 4.2 to 7.3 grams/mile for carbon
monoxide, from 0.6 to 1.53 grams/mile for oxides of nitrogen, and from 0.10 to 0.12 grams/mile for particulate matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The CAAA also require EPA to establish standards for carbon monoxide emissions at 20 degrees Fahrenheit, which came
into effect in the current model year. Further, for all gasoline-fueled motor vehicles, the CAAA require EPA to promulgate
regulations covering evaporative emissions (1) during operation (``running losses'') and (2) over two or more days
of non-use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their questionnaire responses, none of the auto companies provided substantial detail on the possible impacts
of these standards on MY 1996&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy capabilities. GM stated, ``The total impact of the
Clean Air Act Tier I and the California emissions standards on truck fuel economy is unknown at this time. *&blank;*&blank;*
Although not quantified, preliminary indications are that there will be some lost opportunities to improve fuel
economy when redesigning our powertrains to comply with these standards.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford stated that, ``[M]ost troublesome is the effect of compliance with the amended Clean Air Act. We project that
compliance has reduced the average truck fuel economy by 0.3 mpg after inclusion of technology which has an offsetting
effect *&blank;*&blank;* and it negates other technology benefits.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA indicated in the NPRM and PRIA that it believes the net impact on CAFE capabilities due to changes in emissions
requirements is likely to be minimal. Some of the new requirements will lead to fuel savings, while others may lead
to fuel economy losses. Benefits will be obtained from enhanced evaporative controls and the ``low temperature''
carbon monoxide standards because manufacturers will sharpen their fuel-control systems, using techniques such
as sequential port fuel injection. Slight fuel economy losses may result from tighter hydrocarbon and nitrous oxides
emissions standards, particularly for larger engines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In their comments on the NPRM, the manufacturers did not provide data indicating that new emissions requirements

Ford believes that NHTSA's list of other Federal standards that might have an impact on light truck fuel economy during
MYs 1995&hyph;97 is insufficient. A more comprehensive list would include Potential Revisions to the Federal Test
Procedure (FTP) such as higher speeds and accelerations and electric dynamometer true road load calibration, IM240
Short Test Requirements, Onboard Diagnostics, Cold CO Testing, Enhanced Evaporative Testing Requirements, Section
177 States, [and] Fuels or Fuel Additives such as reformulated gasoline and MMT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this point, Ford has not allocated resources to collectively assess the fuel economy implications, of required
emission control system calibration strategies and hardware, that may be associated with the above requirements.
However, it is reasonable to believe that several of these potential requirements will have a significant impact
on light truck fuel economy.

of these standards is presented in the Regulatory Evaluation. A summary of the agency's analysis follows:

1. Potential Revisions to the Federal Test Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has not to date proposed any revisions to the FTP, so no impact is expected for MYs 1996&hyph;97.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has issued new inspection and maintenance test procedures to help ensure that vehicle emission controls function
properly in real-world use, and has proposed a new Certification Short Test procedure. It has also issued a rule, effective
for MY 1996, outlining new Certification Short Test procedures to ensure that properly maintained passenger cars
and light trucks have no elements of design that would cause ``pattern failure'' in inspection and maintenance programs.
However, EPA's analyses have not indicated that there would be any impact on manufacturers' fuel economy capabilities
as a result of these rulemakings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has issued a final rule on onboard diagnostics that applies to MY 1994 and later passenger cars and light trucks,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has issued new low temperature carbon monoxide testing requirements which will apply to all MY 1996 and later model

and may actually result in a slight fuel economy benefit.

5. Enhanced Evaporative Testing Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has recently issued enhanced evaporative emissions standards. Any negative impact on fuel economy (due to increased
weights of upgraded evaporative emissions control system) would be very slight. EPA estimates that larger evaporative
canisters, vapor lines, and purge valves will add an average of 2.9 pounds to the weight of a light duty truck. Using
NHTSA's secondary weight multiplier of 1.7, this would mean a total increase of 4.9 pounds, which would reduce fuel
economy by approximately 0.017 mpg. However, this requirement only applies to 20 percent of MY 1996 vehicles and 40
percent of MY 1997 vehicles, so the total respective fuel economy penalties would not be greater than 0.003 mpg and
0.007 mpg. EPA, however, expects offsetting fuel economy benefits, which it has not yet quantified.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``Section 177 States'' refers to states which voluntarily adopt the more stringent California emissions
standards. At this time, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, and other Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states
have either passed legislation to adopt the California emissions standards during the mid-1990s, or are considering
enacting such legislation. However, there are ongoing legal challenges to adoption of the California emissions
standards. NHTSA has not received any data showing any impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy capabilities
as a result of states other than California adopting the California emissions standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has not proposed any changes in the current certification test fuel, so NHTSA does not expect any fuel economy impact
for MYs 1996&hyph;97 light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has not made any adjustments to the manufacturers' CAFE projections to account for any impacts of changing emissions
standards during MYs 1996&hyph;97. The agency notes that Ford appears to be the only manufacturer that explicitly
included a potential fuel economy loss (an average of 0.3 mpg) in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE projection. Since Ford
is not the ``least capable'' manufacturer and NHTSA is not basing the selection of the MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck
CAFE standard primarily on Ford's capability, it is unnecessary to resolve whether Ford's capability should be adjusted
upward because of Ford's inclusion of this estimated fuel economy loss in its projection.

C. Test Weight for Light Trucks Over 6,000 Pounds GVWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CAAA require that, beginning with MY 1996, many light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR be tested, for emissions purposes,
at the average of curb weight and GVWR. This requirement applies to one-half the ``over 6,000 pound'' fleet in MY 1996
and all of this fleet in MY 1997. Previously, test weights were determined based on ``loaded vehicle weight,'' (LVW)
which is defined as curb weight plus 300 pounds. Loaded vehicle weight has been the sole basis used to calculate ``equivalent
test weight,'' which is the weight used for dynamometer testing. EPA has defined the average of vehicle curb weight
and GVWR to be ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'' (ALVW) (see 56 FR 25739), which will be used as the basis for determining
equivalent test weight for emission testing of the ``over 6,000 pound'' test fleet described above. ALVW is higher
than the LVW, and if light trucks are tested at ALVW, there will be a loss in the estimated fuel economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAAA do not require fuel economy testing to be performed at ALVW. However, because exhaust emissions testing must
be done at ALVW for light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR, use of a different test weight system for fuel economy could
require manufacturers and EPA (when conducting confirmatory tests) to test each of these trucks twice: once at its
``equivalent test weight'' based on LVW for fuel economy purposes and once based on ALVW for exhaust emissions purposes.
Another approach would be for EPA to mandate that trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR be fuel economy tested at ALVW and for
NHTSA to consider any resulting deleterious fuel economy effect in establishing CAFE standards for the affected
model years. A third approach would be to have a manufacturer-specific test procedure adjustment to account for the
proportion of its fleet affected by this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic auto manufacturers have pointed out that testing at the higher weights would have a negative fuel economy
impact. Using MY 1992 data, GM claimed a potential impact in MY 1997 of at least 0.5 mpg. Ford estimated a possible loss
in MY 1997 of 0.2&hyph;0.3 mpg. Chrysler did not give a specific number but agreed that fuel economy would be lowered.
Import manufacturers are unlikely to have any significant penalty from this test procedure change because they produce
few, if any, light trucks with a GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a letter dated February 18, 1992, EPA stated that NHTSA should set CAFE standards with the heavier test weight in
mind and stated that dual testing would entail increased expenses. EPA also noted that EPCA requires integrated fuel
economy and emissions testing, although this requirement is limited by the language ``to the extent practicable.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the EPA letter was sent, MVMA (now AAMA) indicated to EPA that requiring the heavier test weight would also increase
testing expenses, by forcing separate fuel economy tests for light trucks above and below 6,000 pounds GVWR. In addition,
MVMA raised concerns that changing the basis for determining fuel economy on only a portion of the light truck fleet
(i.e., those above 6,000 pounds GVWR) would cause consumer confusion and affect the competitiveness of manufacturers
with a higher proportion of the sales of the heavier light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments on the appropriate means of handling this issue in the context of setting the
MY 1995&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy standards. The agency stated that if EPA mandates fuel economy testing at
ALVW, NHTSA would account for the impacts of this testing in establishing light truck fuel economy standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Included in the proposal is a request for comments on the consequences of performing fuel economy testing for heavy

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The EPA plans to defer to NHTSA's policy decisions on issues such as the competitiveness effects

In commenting on the NPRM, GM, Ford, Chrysler, AAMA and Rover Group all supported the continuation of fuel economy
testing at LVW. AAMA's comment was typical, ``Retention of the LVW criteria will avoid needless test and CAFE data
base complexities, avoid added customer confusion when comparing fuel economy labels and avoid creation of unrealistic
competitive fuel economy rating differences.''

After considering the comments on the new emissions test procedure requirements, NHTSA has concluded that the simplest
and most equitable procedure for both manufacturers and the Federal government is to continue fuel economy certification
using LVW values for all classes of vehicles. NHTSA has informed EPA of its decision and, in a March 4, 1993 letter to
NHTSA, EPA agreed to abide by NHTSA's decision and stated that it would undertake ``the regulatory and guidance revisions
needed to allow dual testing.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under terms of the international Montreal Protocol, the United States and other industrialized nations have agreed
to halt production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000. In February 1992, President Bush announced that
the United States would phase out production by the end of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Ford and General Motors identified weight penalties for eliminating the use of CFCs in their vehicles' air conditioning
systems of seven pounds or less for each MY 1995&hyph;97. NHTSA estimated that these weight additions could result
in an average fuel economy penalty of 0.02 mpg. These weight effects are included in the manufacturers' fuel economy
projections.

V. Domestic/Import Fleet Distinction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to eliminate the requirement that captive imports and other light trucks be required to
meet light truck CAFE standards separately. This requirement has been in effect since MY 1980 (see 42 FR 63184, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, December 15, 1977). At the time the agency introduced these separate categories, it believed that the division would
prevent light truck CAFE standards from acting as an incentive for the domestic manufacturers to increase the numbers
of captive import vehicles in their fleets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the past decade, however, the captive import sector of the fleet has become insignificant. Whereas in 1980, captive
imports accounted for 14.7 percent of the overall light truck market, in 1992 they made up less than 0.5 percent of that
market. GM and Ford no longer have any captive import light trucks. Chrysler's captive import fleet consisted, for
MY 1993, of only about 6,000 vehicles (compact pickups produced in Japan by Mitsubishi). Given the changes in market
conditions, NHTSA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that there is no need or reason to continue to maintain the separate
categories. While the Act specifies a similar two-fleet rule for passenger automobiles, it does not require the agency
to provide similar treatment to light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their comments to the NPRM, the domestic manufacturers and the AAMA supported elimination of the captive import
category. The agency did not receive any other comments that addressed the issue.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed above and in the NPRM, and in light of the comments, beginning in MY 1996, the agency will no
longer require light trucks to meet the CAFE standard separately, based on whether they are captive imports. A new
Table IV is being added to the regulatory text, which indicates a single CAFE standard for all light trucks without
category distinctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since CAFE credits cannot ordinarily be applied across classes of light trucks, the agency proposed a method of accommodating
the 3-year carryforward and carryback of credits for light trucks after the elimination of the two-fleet requirement.
Only Chrysler commented on the proposal, stating that it agreed with the agency. No other comments addressed the issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manner in which NHTSA will allow CAFE credits to be carried forward or backward once the captive import and other
fleets are combined is the same as that used by the agency during the transition from 2WD and 4WD standards for MYs 1980&hyph;81
to optional combined standards for MY 1982 and later (45 FR 83233, December 18, 1990), as well as the subsequent termination
of any 2WD/4WD option in favor of a single combined standard for all configurations in MY 1992 (55 FR 12487, April 4,
1990). For MY's 1993&hyph;95, a manufacturer's captive import and other light truck credits can be applied to offset
shortfalls in the combined fleet incurred up to three model years later (i.e., MYs 1996&hyph;98). If, on the other
hand, a manufacturer wished to use credits earned in the three years after elimination of the two-fleet requirement
to offset a shortfall incurred between MY 1993 and MY 1995, the manufacturer would have to separate its MYs 1996&hyph;98
CAFE credits into ``captive import'' and ``other'' components based on each fraction of the fleet's share of total
production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that it does not foresee any manufacturer making use of carryforward or carryback credits for captive
imports, however. As mentioned above, in the relevant years, only Chrysler has had even a minimal number of captive
imports, and it has not needed to use any credits during that time. Nor does the agency expect any manufacturer to establish
a captive import fleet in the MY 1996&hyph;98 timeframe.

VI. The Need of the Nation To Conserve Energy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The import share reached 36.8 percent in 1975, the year
EPCA was passed, and peaked at 46.4 percent in 1977, at a cost of $91 billion (stated in 1992 dollars). Although the share
declined to below 30 percent in the mid-1980's, lately the United States has again become increasingly dependent
on imported oil. Over 40 percent of the country's petroleum needs have been imported in every year since 1988. In 1992,
imports totaled 43.6 percent. Sharply lower oil prices in the past decade, however, cut the value of oil imports to
$50.5 billion in 1992.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, the percentage of imported oil purchased from OPEC sources, which peaked at 70 percent in 1977, and declined
to a low of 36 percent in 1985, has been steadily rising since then, and has been over 50 percent every year since 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The average cost of crude oil imports jumped from $4.08 per barrel in 1973 to $12.52 in 1974 as a result of the oil embargo
against selected countries, including the United States, by Arab members of OPEC. Additional increases in the cost
of oil occurred in 1979&hyph;80, due to unrest in Iran (which eliminated a substantial portion of that country's oil
output), and in 1980&hyph;81, when the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war reduced supply from the area. In 1981, the United
States adopted a policy of reliance on market forces and decontrolled the price of oil. Since 1981, prices have fallen
as conservation efforts continue. In 1990&hyph;91, petroleum prices were affected by the conflict in the Persian
Gulf. In the beginning of 1992, the continued worldwide economic recession and high levels of crude oil production
by OPEC member countries together held down oil prices. The average refiner acquisition cost of imported crude oil
in 1992 was $17.75 per barrel, which was 4.2 percent below the average 1991 level (in 1992 dollars). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current energy situation and emerging trends point to the continued importance of oil conservation. The United
States now imports a higher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and the percentage
of its oil supplied by OPEC is similar to that of 1975. Oil continues to account for over 40 percent of all energy used
in the United States, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportation sector. Despite legislation such
as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California's strict ``clean fuel'' and emissions standards, gasoline
will likely remain the predominant fuel in the transportation sector. Domestic oil production has declined steadily
since reaching a peak of 10.6 million barrels per day in 1985 and dropping to 9.0 million barrels per day in 1992. Domestic
production is expected to continue declining by roughly 200,000 barrels per day each year through the year 2000. While
the United States is currently the world's second largest oil producer, it contains only about three percent of the
world's known oil reserves. Persian Gulf countries contain 63 percent of known world reserves, and former communist
countries contain 9 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Long-term projections of petroleum prices, supply, and demand are now influenced by a wide range of uncertainties
associated with sweeping economic and political changes in the former U.S.S.R. and in Eastern Europe, environmental
issues, and the role of Middle East countries in determining the world's future oil supplies and prices, and future
energy demands in populous developing countries. The Department of Energy projects that oil prices will be between
$14 and $30 (1992 dollars) per barrel in the year 2000, and will rise to between $19 and $39 per barrel by 2010. DOE projects
a continuing decline in domestic oil production to between 3.54 and 6.73 million barrels per day in 2010, with imports
rising to between 52 percent and 72 percent of total use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The level of petroleum imports is only one aspect of the total energy conservation picture. Under EPCA and NEPA, for
example, national security, energy independence, resource conservation, and environmental protection must all
be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1987, the Department of Energy submitted a report to the President entitled ``Energy Security.'' NHTSA believes
that the following quotation from that report continues to represent a useful summary of the national security and
energy independence aspects of the current energy situation:

Although dependence on insecure oil supplies is *&blank;*&blank;* projected to grow, energy security depends in
part on the ability of importing nations to respond to oil supply disruptions; and this is improving. The decontrol
of oil prices in the United States, as well as similar moves in other countries, has made economies more adaptable to
changing situations. Furthermore, the large strategic oil reserves that have been established in the United States
(and to a lesser extent, in other major oil-importing nations) will make it possible to respond far more effectively
to any future disruptions than has been the case in the past. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current world energy situation and the outlook for the future include both opportunities and risks. The oil price
drop of 1986 showed how consumers can be helped by a more competitive oil market. If adequate supplies of oil and other
energy resources continue to be available at reasonable prices, this will provide a boost to a world economy. At the
same time, the projected increase in reliance on relatively few oil suppliers implies certain risks for the United
States and the free world. These risks can be summarized as follows: If a small group of leading oil producers can dominate
the world's energy markets, this could result in artificially high prices (or just sharp upward and downward price
swings), which would necessitate difficult economic adjustments and cause hardships to all consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revolutions, regional wars, or aggression from outside powers could disrupt a large volume of oil supplies from the
Persian Gulf, inflicting severe damage on the economies of the United States and allied nations. Oil price increases
precipitated by the 1978&hyph;79 Iranian revolution contributed to the largest recession since the 1930's. Similar
or larger events in the future could have far-reaching economic, geopolitical, or even military implications.

Based on the above, NHTSA concludes that there is a continuing need for the nation to conserve energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in market share of light trucks points to the need for enhanced fuel economy for this class of vehicle.
Light trucks are less fuel efficient and are driven more miles over their lifetime than passenger automobiles. Currently,
more than half of the energy in the transportation sector is used by light-duty vehicles (automobiles and light trucks).
Light trucks have steadily increased their share of petroleum use in the transportation sector. In 1973, light trucks
accounted for approximately 12 percent of transportation petroleum use, a figure which increased to roughly 20 percent
by 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light trucks meeting the MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard will be more fuel-efficient than the average vehicle in the current
light truck fleet in service, thus making a positive contribution to petroleum conservation.

VII. Determining the Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, section 502(b) requires that light truck fuel economy standards be set at the maximum feasible
average fuel economy level. In making this determination, the agency must consider the four factors of section 502(e):
technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel
economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Interpretation of ``Feasible'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar language in other statutes, the agency has in the past
interpreted ``feasible'' to refer to whether something is capable of being done. The agency has thus concluded in
the past that a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and
(2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking account of what manufacturers are able to do in light
of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average
fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Industry-wide Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer
basis or on an industry-wide basis. Legislative history may be used as an indication of congressional intent in resolving
ambiguities in statutory language. The agency believes that the below-quoted language provides guidance on the
meaning of ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Conference Report to the 1975 Act (S. Rep. No. 94&hyph;516, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 154&hyph;55 (1975)) states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Such determination [of maximum feasible average fuel economy level] should take industry-wide considerations
into account. For example, a determination of maximum feasible average fuel economy should not be keyed to the single
manufacturer which might have the most difficulty achieving a given level of average fuel economy. Rather, the Secretary
must weigh the benefits to the nation of a higher average fuel economy standard against the difficulties of individual
manufacturers. Such difficulties, however, should be given appropriate weight in setting the standard in light
of the small number of domestic manufacturers that currently exist and the possible implications for the national
economy and for reduced competition association [sic] with a severe strain on any manufacturer *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is clear from the Conference Report that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least
capable manufacturer. Rather, NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum
feasible average fuel economy level.

NHTSA has traditionally set light truck standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles
constitute a substantial share of the market. The agency did set the MY 1982 light truck fuel economy standards at a
level which it recognized might be above the maximum feasible fuel economy capability of Chrysler, based on the conclusion
that the energy benefits associated with the higher standard would outweigh the harm to Chrysler. 45 FR 20871, 20876,
March 31, 1980. However, as the agency noted in deciding not to set the MYs 1983&hyph;85 light truck standards above
Ford's level of capability, Chrysler had only 10&hyph;15 percent of the light truck domestic sales, while Ford had
about 35 percent. 45 FR 81593, 81599, December 11, 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Petroleum Consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The energy savings that could result from the MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard can be illustrated by considering the potential
effects of a standard set at different levels. Since Ford and Chrysler project CAFE levels for both MY 1996 and 1997
above 20.7 mpg, a standard set at 20.7 mpg would not likely have any effect on those companies. Since GM currently projects
a CAFE level of 20.5 mpg for both model years, a standard set at 20.7 mpg, the level NHTSA has determined to be GM's capability,
would encourage it to achieve a higher CAFE level. If a 20.7 mpg standard resulted in GM achieving a CAFE level 0.2 mpg
above its current projection, there would be a savings of 102 million gallons of gasoline over the lifetime of GM's
fleet for each model year. (This assumes GM would sell the same number of light trucks in MY 1996 and MY 1997 as it did in
MY 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential savings associated with a MY 1996&hyph;97 standard above 20.7 mpg are highly uncertain. Assume, for
example, that a standard could be set at 21.2 mpg, 0.5 mpg above GM's capability for both model years and 0.4 mpg above
Chrysler's capability for MY 1996 and 0.2 mpg above its capability for MY 1997. Since Ford projects CAFE levels of 21.1
mpg and 21.6 mpg for MY 1996&hyph;97, such standards would likely have little or no impact on that company. GM and Chrysler
could likely meet the levels of the standards only by restricting the sales of their large light trucks. If this occurred,
consumers might tend to keep their older, less-fuel efficient light trucks in service longer. Also, consumers might
purchase still larger trucks that are not subject to CAFE standards. Therefore, the agency believes that any additional
energy savings associated with alternative higher fuel economy standards above 20.7 mpg (the level the agency has
determined to be GM's capability) would be uncertain and speculative.

As indicated above, most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle
portion of the light truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those companies. Only
three light truck manufacturers, Range Rover, PAS and UMC, are expected to have fuel economy levels lower than the
major domestic manufacturers. Since these companies have an extremely small market share, NHTSA concludes that
setting a standard based on their capabilities would be inconsistent with a determination of maximum feasibility
that takes industry-wide considerations into account, as required by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales
for MYs 1996&hyph;97. NHTSA also concludes that 20.7 mpg is the maximum feasible standard for both MYs 1996 and 1997.
For the reasons discussed below, this level balances the potential petroleum savings associated with a higher standard
against the difficulties of manufacturers facing a potentially higher standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that a 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will make a positive contribution
to petroleum conservation by encouraging GM, which has a large market share, to achieve a higher CAFE level than it
currently projects while remaining within its fuel economy capability. The agency notes that a 20.7 mpg standard
is 0.2 mpg higher than GM's current MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE projection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 20.7 mpg standard will not unduly restrict consumer choice or have adverse economic impacts on the large domestic
manufacturers. The current product plans of Ford and Chrysler indicate that they expect to achieve MYs 1996&hyph;97
CAFE levels that are above 20.7 mpg. Therefore, they will not have to make any changes in their product plans to achieve
the level of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While GM's current product plan shows expected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFEs of 20.5 mpg in each model year, NHTSA's analysis
indicates that company can achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both years. As discussed above, this conclusion is based on
the following assumptions: (1) The 4WD share of the market will not significantly increase between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97,
(2) GM will make successful efforts to maintain market share of certain vehicles, (3) GM can make minor changes in the
performance levels of its vehicles to bring them more in line with its competitors, and (4) GM can make small improvements
by increasing the penetration of some engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for
full implementation. All of these actions are very minor and, the agency believes, within GM's capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that a higher standard than 20.7 mpg for MYs 1996&hyph;97 could result in serious economic difficulties
for GM. While GM can achieve 20.7 mpg CAFE without significant product restrictions, such restrictions could be required
to achieve a CAFE higher than 20.7 mpg. Given leadtime constraints, NHTSA believes that the first potential fuel-efficiency
actions that GM or any other manufacturer would consider in response to a higher standard would consist of marketing
actions. For the reasons discussed in other notices, however, the agency does not believe that marketing actions
can be relied upon to significantly improve a manufacturer's CAFE. See, e.g., MY 1993&hyph;94 light truck CAFE final
rule (56 FR 13775, April 4, 1991). If such marketing actions were unsuccessful in whole or in part, GM would likely have
to engage in significant product restrictions to achieve the level of a higher CAFE standard. Such product restrictions
could result in adverse economic consequences for GM, its employees and the economy as a whole and limit consumer choice,
especially with regard to the load-carrying needs of light truck purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, while NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of
sales, the agency believes that GM's capability is not significantly below that of Chrysler. GM and Chrysler, combined,
sell over 50 percent of all new light trucks each model year. Therefore, even if the agency were to set a standard above
GM's capability, the standard could not be much above 20.7 mpg and still remain within the capability of the majority
of the industry.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that the 20.7 mpg standard balances the potentially serious adverse economic consequences for GM
that could result from a higher standard with the potential for increased petroleum savings. The agency concludes,
in view of the statutory requirement to consider specified factors, that the relatively small and uncertain energy
savings associated with setting a standard above GM's capability would not justify the potential harm to that company
and the economy as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Alert and CEI requested that NHTSA consider the safety effects of its decision. Those commenters stated
that the agency should not in any way avoid analyzing the potential safety consequences of a decision to increase the
CAFE standards for light trucks. Consumer Alert and CEI cited the record of NHTSA's rulemaking concerning the MY 1990
passenger car CAFE standard, although they recognized that the safety consequences of a decision to raise the CAFE
standard for light trucks may differ somewhat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of passenger car CAFE standards, NHTSA has recognized that CAFE standards could adversely affect safety
to the extent that they result in significant reductions in car size and/or weight. This issue was discussed at length
in the agency's notice terminating rulemaking on the MY 1990 passenger car CAFE standard (see 58 FR 6939, February
3, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of the extent to which significantly higher light truck CAFE standards could affect safety is more complex
than for passenger car standards, since purchasers would have many more options for substitution (e.g., different
kinds of light trucks, trucks with a high enough GVWR that they are not subject to CAFE standards, etc.) The agency notes
that since light trucks are generally significantly larger and heavier than passenger cars, any safety effects of
a particular weight reduction would likely be smaller than for cars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NHTSA recognizes that significantly higher light truck CAFE standards could adversely affect safety, to the
extent that they resulted in significant reductions in light truck size and/or weight, the available evidence indicates
that MYs 1996&hyph;97 standard of 20.7 mpg will not have any impact on safety. NHTSA notes that, in setting the light
truck CAFE standards for recent model years, the agency did not include in its analyses of manufacturer capabilities
any product plan actions that would significantly affect the weight, size or cost of the vehicles the manufacturers
planned to offer. The agency also notes that the average equivalent test weight of light trucks has increased from
3,805 pounds in MY 1984 to 4,169 pounds in MY 1992. Therefore, NHTSA believes that CAFE standards during this period
have not had any measurable effect on light truck weight or size. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also notes that the levels of the light truck CAFE standards have not varied significantly for more than
a decade. The light truck CAFE standards for MY 1987&hyph;89 and MY 1994 were set at 20.5 mpg, and, as far back as MY 1984,
the standard was 20.0 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA therefore believes that the size and weight of current and planned light trucks are not significantly different
from what would have occurred in the absence of CAFE standards. As discussed above, Ford and Chrysler will exceed the
level of the 20.7 mpg standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 without making any changes in their product plans. While GM will
need to make some changes in its product plan to achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg, the agency does not believe that it is necessary,
or likely, for that company to take actions that would have any adverse effect on safety, in order to achieve that CAFE
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, in determining that GM can achieve MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE levels of 20.7 mpg, NHTSA adjusted GM's
projected CAFE level of 20.5 mpg based on several factors. First, the agency adjusted it upward to reflect more realistic
mix assumptions with respect to 4WD market share and maintaining market share of certain more fuel-efficient vehicles.
Since this adjustment simply reflects the agency's judgment of what GM is likely to be able to sell, based on historical
experience, the adjustment does not induce or compel any actions with safety implications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also concluded that GM can improve its projected MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by a slight reduction in vehicle performance.
This would involve changes in such things as axle ratios. The agency believes that a slight reduction in performance
would not have any adverse safety consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency concluded that GM could improve its MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by increasing the penetration of some
engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for full implementation. This action would
not result in reduced vehicle weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 1996&hyph;97 will not lead to significant reductions in light
truck size or weight, or shifts toward less safe vehicles, the agency concludes that it is not likely to have any impact
on safety.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency has considered the impact this rulemaking will have on small
entities. I certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required for this action. No light truck manufacturer subject
to the standard will be classified as a ``small business'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In the case of other
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental units which purchase light trucks, the standard
will not affect the availability of the full range of light trucks or have a significant effect on the overall cost of
purchasing and operating light trucks.

This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,

This final rule will not have any retroactive effect. Under section 509(a) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost
Savings Act (the Cost Savings Act; 15 U.S.C. 2009(a)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle fuel economy standard is in
effect, a state may not adopt or enforce any law or regulation relating to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy
standards applicable to vehicles covered by the Federal standard. Under section 509(b) of the Cost Savings Act (15
U.S.C. 2009(b)) a state may not require fuel economy labels on vehicles covered by section 506 of the Cost Savings Act
(15 U.S.C. 2006) which are not identical to the Federal standard. Section 509 does not apply to vehicles procured for
the State's use. Section 504 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final
rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal average fuel economy standards. That section does not require
submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in
court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is revising portions of the general industry safety standards
addressing personal protective equipment (PPE). The standards being revised include those containing general
requirements for all PPE (1910.132) and standards that set design, selection, and use requirements for specific
types of PPE (eye, face, head, foot and hand). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency is updating the standards for PPE to be more consistent with the current consensus regarding good industry
practices, as reflected by the latest editions of the pertinent American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards.
The revision will provide guidance for the selection and use of PPE as well as clearer requirements that are performance-oriented,
where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 New paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) (containing requirements covering equipment selection, defective and damaged
equipment, and training, respectively) have been added to 1910.132. Also, a new section (1910.138) has been added
to this Subpart to address hazards to the hands. Non-mandatory appendices A and B have also been added to this Subpart
to provide additional guidance to employers and employees with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The existing OSHA standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) are contained in Subpart I of OSHA's general
industry standards. These standards were adopted in 1971 from established Federal standards and national consensus
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing a proposed revision of Subpart I, the Agency performed a comprehensive review of the PPE standards.
This review revealed several limitations and concerns with respect to these standards. First, OSHA determined that
many of the existing PPE standards were outdated since they reflected knowledge and practices regarding PPE as they
existed in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This meant that employers were being required to explain how compliance
with more recent editions of the pertinent consensus standards provides equivalent protection to that provided
by the older editions in the OSHA standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Agency determined that there were certain gaps in coverage of the PPE standards, and that the standards
set very restrictive design criteria which might limit the use of new technology. OSHA was concerned that restraints
on innovation might also make it more difficult for employers either to increase acceptance of PPE, or to provide more
protective PPE. Recognizing this situation, the Agency established a process under which OSHA has accepted, for
example, on a case-by-case basis, the use of eye protection which, while not designed to meet the specifications in
the existing standards, had been demonstrated to provide equivalent or superior worker protection. The Agency determined,
however, that this process could not keep pace with the development of improved PPE. Consequently, OSHA was concerned
that, unless the PPE standards were revised to be more performance-oriented, employers and product manufacturers
might be discouraged from improving their equipment and from providing improved protection to workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA had obtained injury data and technical reports which showed that injuries were occurring to employees
who were wearing PPE as well as to those employees who were not wearing PPE. This indicated that, in some cases, significant
improvements in PPE design and acceptance might be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these concerns, OSHA developed a proposed revision to its PPE standards. The proposed revision was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on August 16, 1989 (54 FR 33832). OSHA proposed to revise the safety standards
for eye and face protection (1910.133); head protection (1910.135); and foot protection (1910.136) by referencing
the latest editions of the corresponding standards published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).
The provisions of existing 1910.134 and 1910.137 (which cover respiratory protection and electrical protective
devices, respectively) are the subjects of separate rulemaking actions and are not addressed by this rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also proposed to revise the ``general requirements'' for PPE (1910.132) by adding provisions that: (1) require
employers to select appropriate PPE based on the hazards present and to assure that employees who obtain their own
PPE follow the employers' selection decisions; (2) prohibit the use of defective or damaged PPE; and (3) require that
employees be trained in the proper use of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM set a period, that ended on October 16, 1990, during which interested persons could comment on the proposal
and request a hearing. OSHA received 129 comments in response to the proposal (Exhibit 3). The Agency also received
several requests for an informal public hearing to discuss and clarify some of the requirements in the proposal, and
to discuss and comment on issues and concerns raised as a result of the proposal. Accordingly, OSHA published a hearing
notice on February 1, 1990 (55 FR 3412). The hearing notice requested testimony and supporting information on the
following issues: (1) Marking of eye and face protection; (2) Third party certification; (3) The use of photochromic
lenses; (4) Training in the proper use of PPE; and (5) The need for additional regulation of PPE (such as gloves, chemical
protective clothing, and bump caps). The hearing notice (55 FR 3412) also extended the comment period until March
20, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hearings on the proposed standard were held in Washington, D.C., on April 3 and 4, 1990, with Administrative Law Judge
Sheldon R. Lipson presiding. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Lipson set July 13, 1990, as the deadline for submission
of post hearing comments and evidence, and September 11, 1990, as the deadline for submission of summations and briefs.
On November 9, 1990, Judge Lipson certified the hearing record, including the hearing transcript and all written
submissions to the docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rulemaking record contains 173 comments, 577 pages of testimony, and 53 exhibits.

II. Workplace Hazards Involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has determined that workers involved in a wide range of occupations are exposed to a significant risk of death
or injury from being struck by various objects in the workplace. OSHA's incident data indicate that a significant
portion of all work related injuries and fatalities involve workers being struck in the eyes, head, face, hand, and
or feet by foreign objects. For example, it has been estimated that as many as 2,500 eye injuries occur in the workplace
every working day (Ex. 2: 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One study indicated that there were 333,272 reported occupational eye injuries for 1985 (Ex. 2: 8). Another study,
pertaining to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
disabling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 injuries, estimated that there were 320,000 hand and finger injuries, 70,000 eye injuries, 70,000 head and face injuries,
and 110,000 foot and toe injuries in 1987. These injuries constituted 31.7 percent of the estimated 1,800,000 total
disabling work injuries for 1987 (Ex. 2: 15). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These examples indicate the degree of the hazard to which employees are exposed. OSHA reviewed many sources that described
the type and number of injuries to employees (e.g. Ex. 2: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22; Ex.
6: 2, 3, 4). While these sources differ as to the number and kind of injuries, they are consistent in pointing out the
high incidence and severity of these accidents, and provide clear evidence of a significant risk to workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, one data source reviewed by OSHA included the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Work Injury Reports
(WIR) on eye, face, foot, head and hand injuries (Ex. 2: 11, 12, 13, 14; Ex. 6: 2). These reports, which examined only
those cases where a worker was injured, identified two major factors: Personal protective equipment was not being
worn the vast majority of the time; and, when some type of protective equipment was worn, it did not fully protect the
worker. For example, one study (Ex. 6: 2) indicated that 70% of the workers experiencing hand injuries were not wearing
gloves. Hand injuries to the remaining 30% of the workers who were wearing gloves were caused by the gloves being either
inadequate, damaged, or the wrong type for the type of hazard present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above-documented incidence of hand injury, OSHA has determined that employers and employees need more
guidance regarding the selection of hand protection than is provided through the generic provisions of proposed
1910.132(d). Therefore, as discussed below, the Agency has provided performance-oriented provisions by adding
1910.138, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hand protection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' to the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule addresses the problems identified in the BLS reports by allowing new innovative designs through the
use of performance-oriented language, by providing information for selecting the proper protection, and by improving
the protection afforded by the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that the revised standards will result in improvement in worker acceptance of wearing PPE by allowing
better and more comfortable designs not presently permitted by the current standards, and by providing information
on selecting the proper equipment for the job. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that compliance with the final rule will result in a significant reduction in the risks to
workers. As noted in the Regulatory Impact Analysis, discussed below, it is estimated that full compliance with the
final rule will prevent 712,000 lost-workdays and 4 fatalities a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has also determined that the revised PPE requirements and criteria in the final rule provide a cost-effective
means for reducing risks to workers. The Agency has determined that these provisions are reasonably necessary and
appropriate to address the need for personal protective equipment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section contains an analysis of the rulemaking record pertaining to certain issues raised in the NPRM, and to
the provisions of the standard, both as proposed and as promulgated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One general objection received during this rulemaking concerned the use of the phrase ``employers shall ensure''
in certain provisions of the proposed standard (e.g. Ex. 3: 46, 80, 94). The commenters expressed the view that, under
the proposed language, employers would be held liable for violations of the standards, regardless of employee misconduct
or other exculpatory considerations. The Agency had proposed the language in question to emphasize the employer's
obligations for compliance with OSHA standards. The proposed language would not have affected an employer's ability
to raise defenses to a citation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the objections, OSHA is revising the proposed language to remove the phrase ``the employer shall ensure''
wherever it appears. The employer's obligations for compliance with standards issued under the OSH Act are unaffected
by this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, concern was expressed regarding the extent to which the proposed standard would allow employees to use PPE that
satisfied the old ANSI standards which were being superseded by current editions through the proposal. In particular,
some commenters (Ex. 3: 68, 69, 100) suggested that the Agency ``grandfather'' existing stocks of PPE (i.e., allow
existing stocks of PPE to be depleted) as long as the PPE meets the ANSI standard in effect at the time of manufacture.
Those commenters stated that, without grandfathering, employers would be required to bear the unreasonable expense
and disruption of replacing millions of items of usable PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal simply required the affected PPE to comply with the then-current editions of the pertinent ANSI standards,
without indicating how PPE produced and tested to satisfy the existing OSHA standards would be treated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that virtually all of the PPE in question has been produced and tested to satisfy the ANSI editions
referenced in either the proposed rule or in the final rule. Therefore, OSHA believes that, by and large, existing
stocks of PPE would comply with the final rule. However, the Agency recognizes that some PPE that pre-dates the referenced
ANSI standards might be unnecessarily excluded from use unless it was ``grandfathered''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, certain protective footwear that complied with the 1983 ANSI edition referenced by the proposal could
be excluded from use because it was not produced and tested to satisfy the 1991 edition referenced by the final rule,
unless the employer demonstrated that the footwear provided equivalent protection. OSHA believes that the differences
between the 1983 and 1991 editions are so slight that it would be unreasonable to require employers to demonstrate
equivalency. The Agency also believes that PPE satisfying the pertinent criteria of the pre-1989 ANSI Z87.1 standard
for eye and face protection or the pre-1986 Z89.1 standard for head protection will adequately protect affected employees.
Therefore, the Agency agrees that it is appropriate to allow continued use of PPE that was purchased prior to the effective
date of the final rule and has revised the proposed rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, as in the NPRM, OSHA has incorporated the pertinent ANSI standards by reference. The Agency has determined
that it is unnecessary to adopt the text of the three ANSI standards, because their criteria are addressed to PPE manufacturers,
not to employers who would be selecting PPE for use by their employees. OSHA believes that it is sufficient to require
that employers ensure either that the PPE used by employees complies with the appropriate ANSI standard or that the
PPE provides protection equivalent to that provided by PPE manufactured to the ANSI criteria.

1910.132 General Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section were not proposed for revision. Paragraph (a) requires that protective
equipment be provided, used and maintained in sanitary and reliable condition, as necessary, to protect employees
from workplace hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) requires that, where employees provide their own equipment, the employer assure the adequacy, including
the proper maintenance and sanitation, of such equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) requires that all personal protective equipment be of safe design and construction for the work to be
performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d): Selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (d), to 1910.132 to address the selection of PPE. OSHA proposed to require employers
to select the PPE for their employees based on an assessment of the hazards in the workplace, and the hazards which employees
are likely to encounter. Because OSHA is aware that some employees obtain their own PPE, the Agency also proposed that
employers be required to inform their employees of the selection decisions and to have their employees follow those
decisions when obtaining PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that a hazard assessment is an important element of a PPE program because it produces the information
needed to select the appropriate PPE for the hazards present or likely to be present at particular workplaces. The
Agency believes that the employer will be capable of determining and evaluating the hazards of a particular workplace.
Paragraph (d) of the final rule is a performance-oriented provision which simply requires employers to use their
awareness of workplace hazards to enable them to select the appropriate PPE for the work being performed. Paragraph
(d) clearly indicates that the employer is accountable both for the quality of the hazard assessment and for the adequacy
of the PPE selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (d), which was substantively identical to the final rule, has been revised for the sake of clarity.
The Agency has also added a note which references Non-mandatory Appendix B of 1910.132. That Appendix provides an
example of procedures that satisfy the hazard assessment requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most rulemaking participants supported the proposed requirement (e.g. Ex. 3: 90, 91, 102). However, some commenters
stated that the proposed paragraph did not clearly indicate if employers would be required to document the hazard
assessment. For example, a commenter from S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc. (Ex. 3: 1) suggested that OSHA clarify documentation
requirements of the workplace assessment. In addition, a commenter from Union Carbide (Ex. 3: 68, pp. 1&hyph;2) stated:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;OSHA should clarify that the hazard assessment referred to there need not be in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA can best determine whether the employer conducted an adequate hazard assessment by inspecting the areas where
PPE is required. It should not be necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that some form of record is needed to provide OSHA compliance officers and affected employees with appropriate
assurance that the required hazard assessment has been performed. The Agency agrees with the commenter that it is
not ``necessary for employers to prepare and retain a formal written hazard assessment.'' Given the performance-oriented
nature of this rulemaking, OSHA has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be
unnecessarily burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has addressed such situations in other rulemakings by requiring employers to verify their compliance
with a requirement through a written certification. For example, OSHA has required certification of training in
the permit-required confined space standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout)
standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); in the Telecommuni-cations standard, 1910.268(c); and (as discussed below) in
1910.132(f)(4) of this final rule. The Agency has found that a written certification is a reasonable means by which
to establish accountability for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(d) of the final
rule through a written certification which identifies the workplace evaluated; the person certifying that the evaluation
has been performed; the date(s) of the hazard assessment; and which identifies the document as a certification of
hazard assessment. This requirement has been added to the final rule as paragraph (d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect
``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j))
specifies that ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not generally include *&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden
other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.''
OSHA has determined that the certification required by paragraph (d)(2) constitutes a ``certification'' for the
purposes of the PRA. Therefore, that certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction
Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR part 1320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern raised during this rulemaking, related to the selection process, was the subject of proper fit of
PPE. A commenter (Ex. 7:10) has stated that, in the past, males constituted the majority of the workforce and PPE was
sized accordingly. As more and more females have entered the workforce, they often have had to choose between wearing
PPE that was sized to fit males, and not wearing PPE at all. This was particularly common with foot protection. As a result,
female workers frequently either have used PPE which did not adequately protect them, or have simply stopped using
PPE because of improper fit and subsequent discomfort. Based on concern for the safety of female employees, the commenter
suggested that OSHA require PPE to fit properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with this comment. Since females constitute a larger percentage of the workforce than ever before, it
is imperative that they (as well as male employees) be provided with PPE that fits properly. Therefore, OSHA is revising
1910.132 (d) to add proper fit as a criterion for PPE selection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (e): Defective and damaged equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA proposed to add a new paragraph, (e), to 1910.132 that stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Defective or damaged personal protective equipment shall not be used.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph is based, in part, on existing 1910.133 (a)(2)(vii), which states that eye protectors should be kept
clean and in good repair. Under the proposed paragraph, the existing requirement was to be strengthened and extended
to cover all PPE, not just eye protectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 41) stated that proposed paragraph (e) should only cover visually observable defects
or damage. For example, a commenter from Johnson Wax (Ex. 3: 1) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA to limit the scope of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ``visible'' defects or damage in PPE.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA certainly agrees that visibly damaged or defective PPE must not be used. However, there are other methods (such
as performance tests to ensure continued integrity) that the employer could use to assure that the PPE used by employees
is repaired or replaced as necessary for the protection of each affected employee. Also, employees can often determine
if the protectiveness of the PPE has been compromised when they are handling the PPE prior to or while donning it. Accordingly,
OSHA believes it would be inappropriate to narrow this provision to cover only visible defects or damage. Therefore,
the Agency is promulgating paragraph 1910.132 (e) as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f): Training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (f) required employers to train employees in the proper use of their PPE. This proposed provision
was based on OSHA's recognition that, as documented by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Work Injury Reports (Ex. 2: 11,
12, 13, 14), a significant number of the employees who sustain work-related injuries have not been trained in the proper
use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (Ex. 3: 64, 117, 119) stated that PPE training, while necessary for respirators and other complex
PPE, is not necessary for relatively simple equipment such as safety shoes and eye protectors. In particular, the
American Trucking Association (ATA) (Ex. 3: 64) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring training and record-keeping for all PPE would severely burden motor carriers in terms of time and the related
costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative, the ATA suggested that OSHA set non-mandatory appendices for the guidance of employers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 84, 104, 121) suggested that the employer be required to train employees only for use of the
PPE that is required by the employer to provide protection against hazards identified for the particular workplace.
The Texas Chemical Council (Ex. 3: 121) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring the employer to train employees on equipment they provide creates an unnecessary and inappropriate burden
on the employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 83, 90, 106, 126) supported the training requirement, as proposed. Du Pont (Ex. 3: 90,
pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Du Pont's position is that proper employee training is fundamental to an effective PPE program. We also agree with
the flexibility this proposed section provides employers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 100, 104) suggested that OSHA revise the proposed paragraph (f) to indicate that training
need only be provided when PPE is first provided to employees. For example, Union Electric (Ex. 3: 100) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Company suggests adding ``at the time it is initially issued.'' The proposal, as written, could imply that employees
must be periodically retrained in the proper use of their equipment. This certainly is unnecessary for such items
as safety glasses, footwear and headgear, which usually are worn routinely on the job. Respirators already have a
periodic training requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, several commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 64, 102, 117) expressed concern that proposed 1910.132(f) would require employers
to operate formal training programs. For example, Monsanto (Ex. 3: 102, pg. 2) stated that OSHA should revise proposed
paragraph (f) to indicate clearly that the training required need not be formal classroom training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) inquired: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to training all employees in the proper use of all PPE, what would qualify as ``training''? The term ``training''
could range from awareness type information to competency training of the employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA should define the term ``training'' or be specific in individual standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 81, 119) stated that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to require ``instruction''
rather than ``training''. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA) (Ex. 3: 81, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training is too elaborate a term for the degree of explanation required with PPE. More sophisticated PPE such as respirators
or hearing protection, which require detailed training, is already provided for by certain OSHA standards. MVMA
recommends that subparagraph (f) be retitled ``Instruction'' and the term ``training'' be changed to ``instructed''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some public hearing participants testified in support of the proposed 1910.132(f) performance-oriented approach
to training. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) testified (Tr. 159: 4/3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* CMA agrees that training is an essential element of an effective personal protective equipment
program. We believe, however, that OSHA should continue to address training with performance-oriented provisions,
not with HAZWOPER-type training requirements. Not only are additional requirements 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 necessary, they would be over-burdensome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, many commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 36, 41, 50, 60, 73, 86, 98, 116, 128) suggested that OSHA revise proposed
1910.132(f) to provide more detailed guidance regarding what constitutes adequate training. For example, CSX Transportation
(Ex. 3: 116) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the performance requirements for a PPE training program should be included under 1910.132(f), since
training is the responsibility of the employer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 123 and 128) emphasized that ``personal'' training is important to a successful training
program. For example, the Food &amp; Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128, pg. 6) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is imperative that this training be conducted by ``live'' personnel who will be available to answer questions that
workers may have. Simply showing a twenty minute video tape shall not constitute adequate training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and care'' of PPE. For example, the
Edison Electric Institute (EEI) (Ex. 3: 73, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To further enhance the protection provided by the standard, EEI recommends amending proposed 1910.132(f) to require
employees to be trained not only in the use of their equipment, but also in its care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, some commenters (Ex. 3: 41, 59, 128) suggested that OSHA require training in the ``use and limitations''
of PPE. The Food &amp; Allied Services Trades (Ex. 3: 128) stated that training in the limitations of PPE is needed ``to
prevent accidents from occurring due to overconfidence in the protective ability of certain types of equipment.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 60, 107&hyph;D) suggested that employees be trained regarding PPE limitations and precautions.
The American Optometric Association (Ex. 3: 60) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe that Section 1910.132(f) on training requirements goes far enough to ensure that any limitations
or precautions provided by the manufacturer of the protector are transmitted to the user and care is taken to see that
such limitations are strictly observed. In addition, we do not believe that appendix B Non-Mandatory Compliance
Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment Selection adequately addresses this area.
There is no guarantee that the training provided employees in the use of eye and face protectors will uniformly cover
the limitations and precautions relating to the use of protectors unless specific requirements for this training
are given. We strongly urge that language making this a mandatory part of training be included in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some other commenters (Ex. 3: 74, 88) suggested that training include information provided by PPE manufacturers.
For example, CF Industries, Inc. (CF) (Ex. 3: 74) objected to the proposed replacement of existing 1910.133(a)(5)
(which requires employers to pass on to employees any information received from manufacturers regarding the limitations
and precautions to be considered when using eye and face protection) by proposed 1910.132(f). The commenter stated:
``CF believes that the proposed section is too broad. Various pieces of personal protective equipment can be used
for the same purpose, but have very different limitations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, two commenters from the State of Connecticut (Ex. 3: 50, 51) stated that ``the final rule for 1910.132(f) should
lean towards being more specific'' and that proposed paragraph (f) should be revised to provide that ``Employees
shall be trained in the proper use, maintenance, care, warning labels and limitations of their personal protective
equipment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should be revised to incorporate the specific
training requirements of existing 1910.120, the standard for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (HAZWOPER). For example, the Emergency Response Management &amp; Training Corporation (Ex. 3: 97) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As it [proposed 1910.132(f)] is currently written there are no specifications as to the quality or quantity of training
an employee will receive on the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment. The inclusion of specific
knowledge requirements and competency demonstration may assist in the goal of improving worker safety in hazardous
environments. 29 CFR 1910.120 and NFPA 472&hyph;1989 (Standard for Professional Competence of Responders to Hazardous
Materials Incidents) are two examples of this type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the concerns expressed regarding what constitutes adequate training, OSHA requested testimony in Issue
4 of the hearing notice (54 FR 3414, February 1, 1990) on the need for additional training requirements. In particular,
Issue 4 indicated that OSHA was considering the promulgation of more specific training requirements, including
provisions similar to those in existing 1910.120, Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER).
The Agency also solicited input regarding what training is needed; how training can be evaluated; when retraining
is necessary; how much time is required for training; what recordkeeping is necessary for training activities; and
what impacts (i.e., costs and benefits) the training requirements would have. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Issue 4, several commenters (Ex. 7: 3, 8, 11, 20, 29, 38) stated that the training requirements should
be more detailed. For example, the General Electric Company (Ex. 7: 3, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Protective equipment training needs to include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Where and how personnel can get the equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A system for identifying the correct equipment for an application *&blank;*&blank;* procedures and operating
manuals should include specifics on protective equipment types, needs and objectives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Equipment should be shown to individuals prior to using each for the first time *&blank;*&blank;* let them touch
and try the items on, the more senses you allow one to use during training the better the person will recall what he/she
learned, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Persons should not be considered competent in protective equipment items until they do a practical test *&blank;*&blank;*
 are able to properly put on the item, explain what protection it provides, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, Boeing (Ex. 7: 38) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Boeing supports the position that additional detail be included in 1910.132 regarding training objectives and methods.
Training should be based on the complexity of the protective equipment requirements. For certain protective equipment
(e.g. safety spectacles) training requirements should be minimal or nonexistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, OSHA received testimony in favor of more specific training requirements at the public hearing. For example,
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) testified (Tr. 23&hyph;24: 4/3) that the key elements
of a successful training program are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1) Sensitizing the workers to the need for such protectors and inviting their participation in developing a suitable
plan for affecting PPE use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Clearly defining the written goals of the PPE program in terms of the target behaviors sought (e.g., appropriate
footwear/eyewear/headwear to be worn, in what areas, what kinds of care required). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Explicit rewards or recognition to be given contingent on the workers displaying actions that conform to the aforementioned
positive acts, including knowledge of results or other forms of feedback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4) Each PPE program should have some basis for evaluation (numbers of workers using/not using specified PPE) so that
modifications could be made should the efforts fall short of the stated goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, the International Chemical Workers Union testified (Tr. 16: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Who is responsible for training employees in the proper use and limitations of personal protective equipment? It
is the employer's responsibility to carry out this training but it is not being done *&blank;*&blank;* Every worker
should be able to determine that the glove being provided to them by their employer is the right one for the chemicals
which they handle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another hearing participant, the National Environmental Training Association (NETA), testified (Tr. 272: 4/4)
that ``the proposal in 132(f) is not performance-oriented, it's too vague and nonspecific.'' NETA also testified
(Tr. 285: 4/4): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The National Environmental Testing Association feels that if OSHA seriously considers training to be important
in protecting worker safety *&blank;*&blank;* then the language at 29 CFR 1910.132(f) will have to be more specific.
Unless training is based on measurable objectives as OSHA has pointed out in the U.S. Department of Labor publication
OSHA 2254 (Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines) then it can only be effective by coincidence.

Many Issue 4 commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 2, 13, 15, 21, 22) stated that OSHA should not promulgate more detailed training
requirements. Those commenters expressed the belief that performance-oriented proposed 1910.132(f) allowed
employers in general industry the flexibility to implement training programs as needed. For example, Amoco Corporation
(Ex. 7: 21, pg.2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that employees should be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment, since the equipment
may not provide adequate protection if used improperly. We feel, however, that training programs are best left to
each employer to develop on an individualized, site-specific basis. Manufacturers often provide information on
their particular products upon which an instructional program can be based. Employers do need an effective formal
training session when the use of new or significantly different equipment is instituted. This requirement helps
ensure that time is actually dedicated to this purpose, and emphasizes the importance of proper use to the employee.
Training guidance would be helpful, especially to small businesses, but we feel strongly that such guidance should
be of a non-mandatory nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Department of the Air Force (Ex. 7: 25) stated that it ``supports locally devised training, rather
than an OSHA legislated program training requirement, as both cost efficient and effective.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, several Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 19, 31, 35) stated that proposed 1910.132(f) should not incorporate the HAZWOPER
training requirements, because 1) general industry PPE was used in a broader class of work environments than HAZWOPER-mandated
PPE, and 2) the PPE covered by proposed 1910.132(f) (e.g., eye and face protection, head protection and foot protection)
was much less complex than that covered by HAZWOPER. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 7: 35)
stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Suggestions that would treat Subpart I in a manner similar to paragraph 1910.120 are without justification. There
is no relationship between the training requirements of paragraph 1910.120 (which are directly responsive to the
enabling legislation dealing with hazardous waste sites) and the use of PPE in the controlled environment of a more
typical place of employment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the National Solid Waste Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 2&hyph;3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While NSWMA supports the concept of a structure for training of employees in the use of PPE, we find the use of the Part
1910.120 training requirements for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response as a model for general industry
to be without any justification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Section 1910.120 rule was intended to provide specific safety criteria to cover a specific industry segment.
There are other industries with equivalent or higher risks where the use of this section as a model would be appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NSWMA suggests that OSHA instead consider a training requirement more closely aligned with the concepts of its Hazard
Communication Standard, wherein the complexity of the program required for compliance would be directly related
to the hazards present. Such a program would require a survey of hazards, establishment of specifications for PPE
to control those hazards, training for employees and documentation of the training, and availability of PPE information
to employees *&blank;*&blank;* In the low-risk example, having donning and doffing procedures formalized provides
no useful function. What is critical is communicating the need for employees to understand the hazards and the need
to utilize PPE on a consistent basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA agrees with commenters that employers need more specific guidance regarding
how to train employees who use PPE. In particular, the Agency has determined that employees need training which enables
them to know, at least: 1) when PPE is necessary; 2) what PPE is necessary; 3) how to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear
PPE; 4) the limitations of the PPE; and 5) the proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, OSHA has revised proposed paragraph (f) so that paragraph (f)(1) of the final rule reads as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer shall provide training, including retraining where appropriate, to each employee who is required by
this section to use PPE. Each such employee shall be trained to know at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) When PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) What PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The limitations of the PPE; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Environmental Training Association (NETA) and other rulemaking participants asserted that in order
to have a successful training program, employers should set measurable training objectives and have their employees

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
demonstrate
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that they have reached those objectives. For example, NETA testified (Tr. 272&hyph;286: 4/4) that in order for training
to be successful, clear and measurable objectives must be set, and employees must demonstrate that the training objectives
have been reached, by showing that they understand the information provided and that they can use the PPE properly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees with these remarks and has stated in one of its own publications (OSHA 2254&hyph;1988): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* in order for the training to be as successful as possible, clear and measurable objectives should
be thought out before the training begins. For an objective to be effective, it should identify as precisely as possible
what the individuals will do to demonstrate that they have learned, or that the objective has been reached. They should
also describe the important conditions under which the individual will demonstrate competence and define what constitutes
acceptable performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, paragraph (f)(2) of the final rule requires that each affected employee demonstrate an understanding
of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1), and the ability to use the PPE properly, before being allowed to perform
work requiring the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(3) of the final rule requires retraining when changes in workplace conditions or changes in the types
of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete, and when inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or
use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained the understanding or skill required by paragraph (f)(2).
This provision, which did not appear in the proposed rule, indicates clearly that employers have an ongoing responsibility
to maintain employee proficiency in the use and care of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA received many comments regarding how employers would indicate their compliance with the proposed training
requirement. Some commenters (e.g., Ex. 3: 41, 90) noted a statement in the NPRM (54 FR at 33841) that ``the proposal
contains no recordkeeping requirements.'' Those commenters agreed with that approach, expressing the belief that
detailed recordkeeping would impose an unreasonable burden, and requested ``clarification'' that no recordkeeping
for training would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Detroit Edison (Ex. 3: 62), referring to proposed paragraph (f), noted, ``Documented proof of training
is required by other regulation. Is documentation required? OSHA should present a clearer picture of this requirement
or delete it.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, United Technologies (Ex. 3: 96) inquired, ``Will perceived improper use of PPE be deemed by OSHA evidence
of inadequate training in the absence of training documentation?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, McDonnell Douglas (Ex. 3: 129) stated, ``Even though OSHA has stated to OMB that this NPR does not have any recordkeeping
requirements, what would be required to prove the ``training'' has been performed?'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the Midwest Consortium for Hazardous Waste Worker Training (Ex. 3: 49, 59, 98, 123) suggested that OSHA
require employers to document the content of their training programs. For example, Murray State University (Ex.
3: 123) stated, ``Training should be mainly hands-on with appropriate documentation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several commenters (e.g. 3: 46, 75, 88, 116) stated that proposed paragraph (f) would already require
employers to document training. Some of those commenters (Ex. 3: 46, 88) stated simply that, contrary to the statement
in Section VII of the proposed rule, OSHA had proposed to require recordkeeping, so the Agency had a responsibility
to justify the burden and to properly estimate the cost of documentation. Other commenters (Ex. 3: 75, 116) stated
that the documentation was needed to verify compliance with the training requirements, and that OSHA should not impose
extensive recordkeeping requirements. For example, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) stated (Ex.
3: 75): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
CMA agrees with OSHA's determination to omit recordkeeping from the proposed rule. While some form of verification
should be maintained as an indication that training has taken place, specific documentation requirements would
only add to the recordkeeping burden without increased safety benefits for employees.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, CSX Transportation (Ex. 3: 116) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In Section 1910.132 a new training requirement exists that will require the establishment of training records for
employees using PPE. While the standard does not specify any recordkeeping requirements, documentation for compliance
purposes is clearly indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, OSHA requested additional comments on the proposed training provision, including information on
the recordkeeping needed to document compliance, in Issue 4 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414, February 1, 1990). In
particular, Issue 4 indicated that, based on NPRM comments (Ex. 3: 70, 86, 97), OSHA was considering training requirements
similar to the HAZWOPER provisions promulgated in 1910.120(e). Section 1910.120(e)(6) requires employers to certify
successful completion of training and to give graduates a written certificate. That provision further provides
that persons who lack such certification shall be prohibited from engaging in hazardous waste operations. In response
to Issue 4, Jackson Products (Ex. 7: 8, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Training of employees in the use of PPE should be the central focus of any rules OSHA is promulgating, as this issue has
the highest potential for reducing worker injuries. Documentation of the training programs could follow the existing
guidelines OSHA has developed for hazardous waste operations and employee right to know training, i.e., training
log, employee signature sheet, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, BP America (Ex. 7: 39) stated, ``we feel that the only criteria for successful completion of a training
course can be that the trainee has mastered the information to the instructor's satisfaction. This can be documented
in several ways including written exams and awarding of certificates.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, some Issue 4 commenters (Ex. 7: 13, 19, 25, 31, 35) opposed the adoption of the HAZWOPER training provisions
in proposed paragraph (f). Regarding the applicability of the HAZWOPER recordkeeping requirements, the National
Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA) stated (Ex. 7: 19, pg. 3): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress mandated additional regulations in the narrow field of the occupational safety and health of hazardous
waste workers because hazardous waste operations and remediations involve, in OSHA's words, ``unique'' work environments.
54 Fed. Reg. 9312. Congress recognized that such operations involve potential exposure to a number of hazardous health
risks unlike those encountered by employees in general industry activities. Thus, the OSHA standard prohibits work
upon a hazardous waste site by anyone who is not properly OSHA-qualified and OSHA-certified. Certification may be
granted only upon completion of initial training and continuing education courses within a comprehensive and exhaustive
number of areas. See 29 CFR  1910.120(e)(6). These comprehensive standards apply whenever and wherever hazardous
waste workers handle hazardous substances. The occupational safety and health requirements in Section 1910.120
were, accordingly, crafted in response to the Congressional insistence that safety and health standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
more stringent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 than those applied to general industry be fashioned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the NSWMA suggested that OSHA model the requirements of proposed 1910.132(f) on the Hazard Communication
Standard. The NSWMA recognized that recordkeeping would be necessary for training, stating: ``In a low-risk situation,
where bump hats and eye shields may be the only devices needed, a simple written program of several pages would suffice.''
In addition, the NSWMA stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Companies should not be required under this suggested system to gain prior OSHA certification of individual programs.
Rather, companies should be permitted to certify that they have developed and implemented programs that are consistent
with OSHA approved standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA acknowledges that the proposed training provision implicitly required some method for verifying compliance.
The Agency believes that the discussion of recordkeeping in Issue 4 of the hearing notice provided adequate notice
that OSHA might require employers to create some method of verifying their training activities. Accordingly, based
on the rulemaking record and for the sake of clarity, the Agency is revising proposed paragraph (f) to state explicitly
that employers must verify that they have provided their employees with the requisite training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the information needed to verify compliance, OSHA agrees with the commenters who have stated that it would
be inappropriate to require specific documentation of the training provided. Given the performance-oriented focus
of this rulemaking, the Agency has determined that the generation and review of extensive documentation would be
unnecessarily burdensome. The Agency also notes that the training needs of employees covered by paragraph (f) of
this section (approximately 22 million) are too diverse to enable OSHA to specify the details required for all of their
PPE training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has determined that employers can adequately verify compliance with 1910.132(f)
of the final rule through a written certification. The Agency has determined that a certification record which identifies
each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and which identifies the document as a certification of training
in the use of PPE, will provide adequate assurance that the employer has provided the requisite training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that OSHA has also required certification of training in the permit&hyph;required confined space
standard, 1910.146(g)(4); the control of hazardous energy (lockout/tagout) standard, 1910.147(c)(7)(iv); and,
in the Telecommunications standard, 1910.268(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also notes that such a document will not preclude a citation if the Agency determines that the employees have not,
in fact, been adequately trained. OSHA believes that compliance with this requirement, while imposing a minimal
burden, provides an important benefit because it enables the employer and OSHA to verify the status of training efforts.
Therefore, OSHA is promulgating new 1910.132(f)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) sets limits on the efforts of federal agencies to collect
``information''. The definition of ``information'' in the OMB regulations implementing the PRA (5 CFR 1320.7(j))
specifies that ``Information does not generally include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* certifications *&blank;*&blank;* provided that they entail no burden other than that necessary
to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent's address, and the nature of the instrument.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that the certification of training required by paragraph (f)(4) constitutes a ``certification''
for the purposes of the PRA.Therefore, the certification would not be subject to the requirements of the Paperwork
Reduction Act or of the implementing regulations (5 CFR Part 1320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1910.133 Eye and face protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1910.133(a) contained general requirements for eye and face protection. Proposed paragraph (a)(1) required
the employer to ensure that employees use appropriate eye or face protection when they are exposed to eye or face hazards
from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acid and caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially
injurious light radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(1) also required that eye protection used by employees provide both front and side protection
from flying objects. This portion of proposed paragraph (a)(1) resulted in many comments. Most rulemaking participants
agreed with OSHA that eye protectors should provide both front and side protection from flying objects (e.g. Ex. 3:
28, 49, 59, 61, 83, 128; Tr. 53: 4/3) because studies (Ex. 2: 11) have indicated that most injuries have occurred (in
those instances when eye protection was used) because flying objects went 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
around
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the protection. However, several rulemaking participants disagreed with this requirement because they believed
that OSHA was proposing that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 eye protectors would have to provide side protection (e.g. Ex. 3: 41, 69). For example, a commenter from the Exxon Company
(Ex. 3: 47, pp.1&hyph;2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Exxon is concerned that the proposal could be interpreted to require all safety glasses to be equipped with side shields.
Exxon's position is that many situations exist where safety glasses without side shields are adequate. For such routine
operations, OSHA should not ignore the fact that most employees will be more reluctant to wear safety glasses with
side shields than glasses without side shields. The mandatory use of side shields on all safety glasses could deter
the overall use of safety glasses on and off the job which would ultimately lead to an increase in the total number of
eye injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We concur with OSHA that employees should be equipped with adequate eye protection to prevent injuries from flying
objects. In those instances where our employees may be potentially exposed to flying objects, our safety program
calls for the mandatory use of eye protection that provides both front and side protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter, from the American Optometric Association, remarked (Ex. 3: 60, pg. 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
While we recognize that mandatory side shields would afford additional protection in many instances, they may not
be practical in all situations. In addition, they may tend to reduce compliance with the use of the protector in cases
where peripheral hazard protection is not required. We would recommend that side shields be required 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 when the job evaluation indicates that a definite peripheral hazard exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA intended that proposed paragraph (a)(2) require side protection only when flying object hazards were present.
Therefore, the Agency has revised the provision concerning flying object hazards to state clearly that front and
side protection are required when there is a hazard from flying objects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that there are situations when side protection is unnecessary, and that employers should be allowed to
decide, based on a hazard assessment which complies with the requirements of 1910.132(d) of the final rule, if such
protection is necessary for their employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While one rulemaking participant (Ex. 3: 66) believed that side shields should be permanently attached, other rulemaking
participants stated that side protectors need not be permanent and that OSHA should permit detachable or clip-on
side protectors. For example, a commenter from Liberty Optical (Ex. 3: 63) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Clip-on side shields meet all the Z&hyph;87 performance standards that the permanent side shields meet and can be
worn when necessary. To be able to wear proper protection where appropriate and be realistic in its use, will make the
employee not look to side step it and, therefore, make it more effective and safer. If a blanket mandatory permanent
side shield regulation to cover all industrial environments is implemented, it will reverse all gains made in recent
years and will not accomplish its goal for a safer industrial environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA agrees that side protection need not be permanent and that detachable side shields should be permitted as long
as they meet the criteria specified in this section of the final rule. Permitting detachable side shields will provide
employers the flexibility to use this kind of protection when necessary, based on conditions at the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has revised proposed paragraph (a)(1) accordingly, dividing the proposed paragraph into two provisions,
1910.133(a)(1) and (a)(2). Paragraph (a)(1) of the final rule states the general requirement to have each employee
use eye or face PPE when exposed to eye or face hazards, while paragraph (a)(2) states that eye PPE must provide side
protection, which may be detachable, when flying object hazards are present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2) required that eye and face protection properly fit employees. Although the Agency did
not receive any comments concerning the proper fit of eye and face protection, OSHA did receive comments addressing
the proper fit of PPE, in general, and the need for properly fitting PPE for both male and female employees. This subject
was discussed previously under 1910.132 of this preamble, and OSHA has included a requirement in 1910.132 of the final
rule that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE properly fit employees. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a)(2) has not been included in the final rule, since it
would be redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA proposed in paragraph (a)(3) that protectors with tinted or variable tinted lenses not be worn when an employee
must pass from a brightly lighted area, such as outdoors, into a dimly lighted area, such as a warehouse. The Agency
proposed this requirement because it believed that the provision might reduce the likelihood that extreme lighting
changes would temporarily impair the vision of an employee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed requirement was the subject of Issue 3 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3412, February 1, 1990). The proposed
paragraph and Issue 3 generated a substantial amount of comment and testimony. While a few rulemaking participants
agreed with the proposed provision (e.g. Ex. 3: 28; Ex. 7: 2, 38), many opposed the provision and/or approach proposed
by OSHA (e.g. Ex. 3: 55, 61, 68; Ex. 7: 7, 8, 15, 23; Tr. 193: 4/3; Tr. 150&hyph;156: 4/4; Tr. 169: 4/4). Some of the rulemaking
participants stated that the proposed paragraph was too restrictive and vague. These rulemaking participants stated
that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
employer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (or designated safety officer) should decide when the use of this type of eyewear may create a hazard. This approach
is similar to that used in the ANSI standard for eye protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989; paragraph 6.5.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the American Optometric Association (Ex. 7: 11, pg. 2) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The use of photochromic lenses in industrial situations is dependent upon the visual demands of the task and the visual
needs of the wearer. The decision on the need for and use of photochromic lenses can best be made by evaluation of the
work place requirements by the employer in consultation with the employee's eye doctor. The development of a blanket
policy restricting the use of photochromic lenses for certain job tasks is unwarranted. The individual visual needs
and working conditions should dictate when photochromic lenses may be inappropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Optometric Association supports the ANSI Z87.1 position which provides employers the discretion to
decide when photochromic lenses may be utilized.

*&blank;*&blank;* the many beneficial features of photochromic lenses, particularly in safety glasses, justifies
their continued unfettered use in the workplace. My concern is that this proposed government intervention will likely
deter workers from using these photochromic lenses as safety devices and that increased numbers of eye injuries and
workplace accidents will ultimately result.

A hearing participant from Corning, Inc. (Tr. 111&hyph;114: 4/4) testified: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, photochromic lenses are used throughout the world and over 500 million lenses have been sold. Roughly, more
than 250 million pairs of eye glasses. Currently, more than 38 million photochromic lens blanks are sold each year.
Corning has therefore literally hundreds of millions of man years of experience with the use of photochromic eyeglasses
without any reported health of safety problem of the type to which the proposed regulation is addressed. I believe
that proposal 1910.133 (a)(3) is too vague and is in any event unnecessary and overly restrictive. The use of photochromic
lenses are subject to the ANSI Z87.1 standards including paragraph 6.5.2 and we believe this is the appropriate standard
for dealing with any possible need for a limitation on photochromic usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In daylight, outdoors, when the photochromic lenses darken to function as sunglasses they protect the eyes dark adaptation
process. It is well known that those who wear sunglasses in sunlight adapt to darker environments up to twice as fast
as those who do not. In the transient condition, that is, coming in from a brighter outdoor condition to a darker indoor
condition, wearing photochromic lenses can actually provide better and more comfortable vision under a broad variety
of work conditions. Visual function in the transition to and from bright light is superior when photochromic rather
than clear lenses are used.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the proposed requirement was too restrictive. The
Agency has determined that the employer, or the employer's representative (such as the company safety professional),
will be in the best position to determine when tinted or variable tint lenses should or should not be used, based on awareness
of workplace conditions. OSHA also notes that this approach is consistent with the current ANSI standard (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989-paragraph
6.5.2) which is (as discussed below) being incorporated by reference in the final rule. Accordingly, proposed paragraph
(a)(3) has not been retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(4) required that employees who wear prescription lenses while engaged in operations that
involve eye hazards shall wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in their design, or shall be protected
by eye protection that can be worn over prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the prescription or protective lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency did not receive any comments on this proposed provision and it is, therefore, contained in the final rule
as proposed. However, since this section has been reorganized, the provision has been redesignated as 1910.133(a)(3)
of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing 1910.133 (a)(4) states that ``every protector shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification
only of the manufacturer.'' OSHA had proposed to delete this provision because the Agency believed that compliance
did not add to or detract from the safety of the protector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a few commenters agreed with OSHA in principle (e.g. Ex. 3: 50, 92, 115), the vast majority of commenters stated
that the marking requirement should not be deleted (e.g. Ex. 3: 75, 88, 92, 114, 126). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (Ex. 3: 71, pg. 4) asserted: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing system of easily identifying the manufacturers of the components of eye PPE is embedded in the standard
to assure accountability and is accepted throughout the industry. It should be retained.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since employees are permitted to provide their own eye protection and employers are held accountable to ensure that
employees are wearing the proper eye protection, these markings provide employers a ready way of checking for whether
or not employees are wearing the proper eye protection.

The identification markings are necessary in the event of a manufacturing defect or material defect, so that the purchaser
may receive an adjustment from the seller or manufacturer. Identification is also needed in case the manufacturer
makes a product recall.

In supporting the concept that OSHA should be consistent with the ANSI requirement for marking, a commenter from US
West, Inc. (Ex. 3: 85, pp. 2&hyph;3) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
US WEST, Inc. recommends that the identifying marking, i.e. manufacturers monogram and ``Z87'', continue to be required
(ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 8.10). US WEST, Inc. disagrees with OSHA's statement that``&sect;*&blank;*&blank;* marking
to identify the manufacturers of eye and face protection does not add or delete from the safety afforded by the protector.''
Lenses meeting ANSI Z87 are easily identified by the manufacturers monogram. ``Street'' or ``dress'' spectacles
not meeting ANSI Z87 are also easily identified by the absence of such markings. US WEST, Inc. has found non-Z87 replacement
prescription lenses placed in employees Z87 frames, reducing the employees degree of protection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above-discussed comments, OSHA included Issue 1 in the Hearing Notice, to elicit more information regarding
the utility of compliance with existing 1910.133(a)(4). The comments and testimony received (Ex. 7: 2, 13, 31; Tr.
55, 133, 156: 4/3; Tr. 68, 148, 225: 4/4) uniformly supported retaining the marking requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, one commenter from SIGNODE (Ex. 7: 6) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There is agreement that marking of eye and face protection ``does not add or detract from the safety afforded by the
protector'' however, the current etched lens marking provide the safety manager, management and supervision a means
of verifying that the worker, employee, contractor or visitor is, in fact, wearing proper safety eyewear, not street
wear.Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the requirement for marking of eye and face protectors
should be retained. OSHA agrees with commenters that the marking of eye and face protectors provides easy recognition
that the protectors meet specified criteria (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989); that marking will provide accountability,
and traceability in cases of product recall; and that marking requirements should be consistent with the ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989
standard, since this is the accepted and recognized practice throughout the industry. Accordingly, the requirement
for marking of eye and face protectors is being retained in 1910.133(a)(4) of the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(5) required that employees use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate
for the work being performed for protection from potentially injurious light radiation. OSHA also proposed a table
in this paragraph which contained a list of appropriate shade numbers for various operations. The Agency did not receive
any comments on this provision, and it is contained in the final rule with minor editorial changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 contained ``acceptable design'' requirements for eye and face protection. In
this provision, OSHA proposed that eye and face protection comply with the design requirements specified in ANSI
Z87.1&hyph;1989, or be of a design which could be demonstrated to be equally effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants supported the proposed adoption of the ANSI standard for eye and face protection (ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989).
However, a few commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 101, 125) expressed concern that the Agency proposed to adopt only the ``design
requirements'' of ANSI Z87.1. These commenters asserted that OSHA should adopt by reference all of the ANSI standard,
not just the design requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees that eye and face protective devices must meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This
requirement is stated explicitly in ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989, Section 3. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not
clearly express the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 in its entirety and is revising the proposed
rule accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 1, 62, 75, 102, 128) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference the ``current''
edition of all of the applicable ANSI standards (i.e., the ANSI standards for eye and face protection, head protection,
and foot protection) rather than referencing a specific edition. These commenters stated that this approach would
prevent a situation where the OSHA standards would be outdated when the ANSI standards are revised in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA notes that it would be improper for the Agency to reference consensus standards as suggested, because such action
would illegally subdelegate authority over the content of OSHA standards to the committees responsible for updating
the ANSI standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency will accept eye and face protective devices as complying with this section if they are demonstrated to be
as effective as those meeting the specific ANSI standard referenced by the final rule. For example, the final rule
is incorporating by reference the 1989 edition of ANSI Z87.1 for eye and face protection. Eye and face protective devices
meeting a subsequent edition of the same ANSI standard would be acceptable to the Agency (and a de minimis violation
of the standard) if it could be demonstrated by the employer that they were as effective as those meeting the 1989 edition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, employers would need to establish either that there was no substantive difference between a subsequent
edition of Z87.1 and the 1989 edition, or that PPE which satisfied subsequently modified test criteria provided protection
equivalent to that provided by PPE which satisfied the 1989 edition. Proposed paragraph (b) of 1910.133 has been revised
accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in
accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been revised
so that paragraph (b)(1) of the final rule reflects that approval and provides the requisite information regarding
access to the text of ANSI Z87.1&hyph;1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has also determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of eye and face PPE purchased
prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z87.1&hyph;1968) referenced
by existing 1910.133(a)(6). To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1)
of the final rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the subject of eye and face protection, Issue 5 of the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412) requested comments
and information concerning the use of contact lenses. Specifically, the Agency asked if it should expand its eye and
face requirements to cover contact lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters (e.g. Ex. 7: 13, 15, 16) stated that no additional regulations were necessary for the use of contact
lenses. Other commenters (Ex. 7: 21, 26) believed that OSHA should address the issue of contact lenses in the final
rule, and should clarify if it is permissible to wear contact lenses with eye protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 107&hyph;D; Ex. 7: 5, 22) stated that wearing contact lenses with appropriate eye
protection does not present any additional hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the rulemaking record, OSHA believes that contact lenses do not pose additional hazards to the wearer, and
has determined that additional regulation addressing the use of contact lenses is unnecessary. The Agency wants
to make it clear, however, that contact lenses are not eye protective devices. If eye hazards are present, appropriate
eye protection must be worn instead of, or in conjunction with, contact lenses.

1910.135 Head Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed 1910.135 set requirements for the use of protective helmets and set criteria for acceptable equipment designs.
Proposed paragraph (a) required employees to wear protective helmets (1) ``when working in areas where there is a
potential for injury to the head from falling or moving objects'' and (2) ``where they are near exposed electrical
conductors which could be contacted by the protective helmets.'' Proposed paragraph (b) referenced American National
Standard, ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, ``Protective Headwear for Industrial Workers-Requirements''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed language was based on existing 1910.132(a) and 1910.135 and on ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. Existing 1910.132(a)
requires that the PPE necessary to protect employees from workplace hazards be provided, used and maintained properly.
That standard specifically includes head protection under its coverage. Existing 1910.135 facilitates compliance
with existing 1910.132(a) regarding helmets worn for protection ``from falling and flying objects and from limited
electric shock and burn,'' by requiring that those helmets comply with the American National Standard Safety Requirements
for Industrial Head Protection, Z89.1&hyph;1969. ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 is the most recent edition of the pertinent
national consensus standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(a)(1), unlike existing 1910.135, explicitly required the use of protective helmets. The proposed
paragraph also made some editorial revisions to existing 1910.135. For example, the proposal replaced ``flying''
with ``moving'', because OSHA believed the term ``moving'' better described the means in which objects contact employees.
OSHA used the terms ``flying'' and ``moving'' in the existing and proposed rules, respectively, in conjunction with
the term ``falling'' to be consistent with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter (Ex. 7: 20) stated that OSHA should address lateral impact protection ``since there are substantial injuries
that occur from directions other than vertical impact*&blank;*&blank;*&sect;'' In the course of this rulemaking,
OSHA obtained a helmet (Ex. 46) capable of protecting employees against lateral as well as vertical impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NIOSH testified (Tr. 30: 4/3) that, while most blows to the head come from the back, front or side, ANSI
Z89.1 1986 addresses only protection for the top of the head. NIOSH further testified: ``Currently helmets are being
marketed that provide impact protection to most parts of the head. OSHA standards should encourage the use of these
more protective helmets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some rulemaking participants (Ex. 3: 84, 96) expressed concern regarding the use of the term ``moving'' in the proposed
paragraph. For example, the American Petroleum Institute (API) (Ex. 3: 84, pg. 4) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
API is opposed to the wording of this paragraph. The ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986 referenced in 1910.135(b) contains
helmet specifications ``to protect the heads of industrial workers from impact or penetration by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
falling objects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*'' OSHA must recognize that the ANSI standard does not provide design criteria for moving objects.
If OSHA intends this section to also cover helmets protecting against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
moving
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 objects, as proposed in 1910.135(a)(1), additional design criteria should be cited in 1910.135(b).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 1910.135 Head Protection, we find the requirement to provide head protection vague, and welcome additional
clarification from OSHA with regard to potential for injury to the head from moving objects. We are concerned compliance
personnel will interpret the requirement so broadly as to include any use of hoisting equipment. Although we can envision
an occasional situation where there may be a hazard, most operations using a hoist would present no significant hazard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter (Ex. 3: 40) suggested that OSHA revise proposed 1910.135(a)(1) so that the provision ``Mandates
that employers require their employees wear protective helmets when they are in an area where there is potential for
injury to the head from falling, moving, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
swinging, flying or airborne objects
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' The commenter did not state why it believed the recommended language was needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Also, commenters (Ex. 3: 72, 79) stated that proposed 1910.135(a)(1) should also require employees to wear head protection
when working in confined spaces and commenters (Ex. 3: 79, 119) have stated that OSHA should require protection against
impacts with fixed objects.. For example, Centel (Ex. 3: 72) noted that injuries may result from contact with low hanging
structures and that Centel already requires its employees working in confined spaces to wear head protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) (Ex. 3: 79) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We believe a statement should be added with provision for protection against impacts with fixed objects. We recommend
a sentence should be added that addresses this hazard. We also suggest that in areas that are confined or congested
and the employee is subject to impact with fixed objects, suitable protective helmets be worn. We recommend that bump
caps should not be used in an industrial environment because there are too many possibilities of head injuries that
could occur. We recommend maximum head protection at all times in this type of environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current ANSI standard, Z89.1&hyph;1986, addresses only protection ``from impact and penetration by falling
objects and from high-voltage electric shock and burn.'' The Agency has determined that it would be inappropriate
for 1910.135(a) to cover head protection that is not also covered by the ANSI standard referenced in 1910.135(b),
unless OSHA provides criteria for assessing compliance. The Agency has determined that it is not in a position to set
such criteria, so OSHA has deleted the term ``moving'' from 1910.135(a)(1) of the final rule and has not added the terms
suggested by commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that compliance with the ANSI criteria referenced through 1910.135(b) of the final rule will
enable employers to protect their employees from a large proportion of potential head hazards. Head protection not
covered by 1910.135 of the final rule, such as would be needed to protect employees from ``moving'' or ``fixed'' objects,
is covered by the general requirements of 1910.132, as revised. OSHA anticipates that employers whose hazard assessments
identify head hazards that are not abated through compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, will develop and implement
other measures as necessary, to protect their employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(a)(2) required that employees who are near exposed energized conductors which their heads could
contact must wear helmets designed for protection from electrical hazards. Two commenters (Ex. 3: 36, 73) suggested
that OSHA revise the proposed provision by adding requirements for proper maintenance of head protection. In particular,
Public Service Electric and Gas Company (Ex. 3: 36) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) should also require: ``Protective
helmets shall be worn and cared for as recommended by the manufacturer. Protective helmets shall not be altered or
defaced which would take away the impact and/or dielectric integrity of the helmet.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that any employee protection which could result from compliance with the suggested language
on maintenance will already be attained through compliance with existing and proposed 1910.132. This section contains
requirements concerning defective and damaged equipment, 1910.132(e); and, training requirements pertaining
to the maintenance of PPE, 1910.132(f)(1)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Ex. 3: 81) stated that proposed paragraph (a)(2) was unclear, because it appeared ``to require
nonconductive helmets for electricians whenever they are ``near exposed electrical conductors'' even if there
is no reasonable probability of contact.'' The commenter suggested that OSHA revise the proposed language to require
the wearing of protective helmets ``WHEN they are near exposed electrical conductors which 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
their heads could contact.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that the suggested language is consistent with the description of proposed paragraph (a)(2) in the
preamble to the proposed rule (54 FR 33836). OSHA agrees that clarification of the proposed paragraph is appropriate
and has revised the proposed paragraph accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed 1910.135(b) required that the design of protective helmets comply with the design requirements of ANSI
Z89.1&hyph;1986 or be of a design that provides equivalent protection. Existing 1910.135 references the requirements
and specifications established in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969. As noted in the preamble to the NPRM (54 FR 33837), OSHA has
determined that, except as regards electrical insulation for Class B helmets, the 1969 and 1986 editions of ANSI Z89.1
set essentially the same requirements. The Agency also has determined that Class B helmets currently in use already
comply with the electrical insulation requirements of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA also proposed to allow protective helmets which, while not designed to the specifications of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986,
were ``demonstrated to be equally effective''. The Agency believed that this performance-oriented approach would
encourage innovation and the use of improved equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter (Ex. 3: 119) stated that the proposed language allowing protective helmets of a design which has been demonstrated
to be equally effective ``is not well defined.'' In addition, the commenter questioned the availability of the means
and the personnel to determine if helmets not designed according to ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 were equally effective.
The commenter suggested that OSHA delete the language in question and require compliance with ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (Ex. 7: 20, pg. 3), in discussing the proposed language ``demonstrated to be equally effective'',
inquired: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

OSHA believes that the performance criteria set out in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 7, indicate clearly how employers
or the Agency can determine if helmets that do not otherwise comply with the consensus standard are ``equally effective''.
OSHA also believes that the performance-oriented language of proposed paragraph (b) allows employers the appropriate
flexibility to address their particular safety needs. Another commenter (Ex. 3: 126) stated that ``protective helmets
should comply with the performance requirements as well as the design requirements of ANSI Standard Z89.1&hyph;1986.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of evaluating these comments, OSHA noted that there are no provisions specifically designated as ``design
requirements'' in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1969 or ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. The 1986 edition, in particular, sets scope and
purpose provisions; definitions; types and classes provisions; materials provisions; physical requirements;
performance requirements; and test methods for protective helmets. The preamble discussion of proposed paragraph
(b) (54 FR 33836&hyph;33837) referenced the physical requirements (e.g., the maximum weight), the performance
requirements (e.g., impact resistance, penetration protection, flammability, water absorption resistance and
electrical insulation) and the test methods (e.g., ``stringent'' test methods for testing of ``Class B'' helmets
against high-voltage) of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA agrees, and intends, that head PPE meet all of the provisions contained in the ANSI standard. This requirement
is stated explicitly in ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986, Section 2. OSHA acknowledges that the proposal did not clearly express
the Agency's intent to reference ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 in its entirety and is revising the proposed provision accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986 has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in
accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Paragraph (b) of the final rule has been revised
to reflect that approval and to provide the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to permit the continued use of head PPE purchased prior
to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (Z89.1&hyph;1969) referenced
by existing 1910.135. To this end, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1) of the final
rule and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal (54 FR 33837), OSHA solicited comments and information concerning bump caps, head protection that
was not addressed in existing or proposed 1910.135 and that would not satisfy the criteria of Z89.1&hyph;1986. In
particular, the Agency requested information with respect to the appropriateness of addressing this type of head
protection in the final rule. OSHA also solicited input regarding the need for regulation of bump caps in Issue 5 of
the Hearing Notice (55 FR 3412). Some rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 40, 58) have suggested that OSHA establish
requirements for bump caps. For example, Sandia National Laboratories (Ex. 3: 58) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Currently, there are no Federal standards, regulations, or guidance of any kind with which industry can make proper
and adequate decisions on the use of bump caps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bump caps are not new to the work place. Where the risk of head injury has been determined to be of low probability or result
in minor contusions, scraps or cuts, bump caps have been provided. The old adage that ``something is better than nothing''
tends to prevail when industry is forced to make an educated guess. Is the adage true in the case of bump caps? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary there is a need for Federal time and money to be spent on discovering the pro's and con's associated with bump
caps and developing corresponding guidance for their use in the work place.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, Kerr-McGee Corporation (Ex. 3: 119, pg. 3) stated : 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Kerr-McGee's use of bump caps is limited to areas where there is no potential for injury to the head from electrical
contact or from falling or moving objects, but where a hazard may exist due to striking one's head against fixed, low-clearance
objects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kerr-McGee is not aware of any voluntary or consensus standards covering bump caps. If the degree of protection afforded
by currently-produced bump caps is determined by scientific studies to be inadequate for their intended use as stated
on the products, then OSHA should request ANSI to develop a standard. Otherwise, we do not see the need for additional
specifications or standards.

requirements for bump caps to the final rule because they believe that if head protection is needed, then it would be
safer to require head protection meeting ANSI Z89.1&hyph;1986. For example, a commenter from the American Trucking
Association (Ex. 3: 64, pg. 5) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For the trucking industry in general, bump caps are not practical. Although they are used in some operations for select
job tasks, the motor carrier industry has found little benefit in reducing minor head injuries through their use.
In fact, safety personnel from a cross section of the nation's motor carriers recently explained that bump caps can
be more of a hinderance than a help; they frequently fall off, and in some instances, they can cause vision obstructions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* Union Carbide would not support a provision pertaining to ``bump caps''. Where there is sufficient

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
We believe that the use of ``bump caps'' has no place in a company-sponsored safety program and therefore do not favor

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
OSHA has concluded, based on review of the rulemaking record, that the available data do not support regulatory action
regarding bump caps. Therefore, the Agency will neither restrict the use of bump caps nor set criteria for such use.
OSHA will evaluate an employer's choice of head protection based on the e hazards to which employees may be exposed.
Therefore, the employer's compliance with the requirement for a hazard assessment, in 1910.132(d), is of critical
importance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed paragraph (a) of this section required employers to ensure that employees wear protective footwear when
working in areas where there is a danger of foot injuries due to falling and rolling objects, or objects piercing the
sole. This proposed provision received a large amount of support from rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59,
64, 67). Many of the rulemaking participants agreed with referencing the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standard for personal protection, ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, ``Protective Footwear,'' particularly since this
standard, unlike the superseded 1967 edition, sets criteria for women's footwear and for puncture resistance. However,
two commenters were concerned as to when this protection would be required. A commenter from the American Trucking
Association (ATA) stated (Ex. 3: 64, pp. 4&hyph;5): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* in some operations drivers may be exposed to falling or rolling freight hazards, or other hazards
presented by nails or other sharp objects. In these cases, safety shoes, non-penetrable soles, or some other type
of protective footwear are appropriate. On the other hand, there are thousands of drivers that never handle freight
or come into exposure with falling or rolling freight, sharp objects, or any other number of hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* The need to require the equipment must be determined on a case by case basis--taking into account
the specific operations, and the specific tasks and hazards of the various job functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter, from the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA), expressed a similar concern with respect to when
foot protection is required (Ex. 3: 2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specialty shoes such as ``electrical hazard'' footwear or ``conductive'' shoes have special requirements that
would not permit metal insoles to prevent the puncture. If this requirement is upheld, the current design standards
and performance criteria for electrical hazard shoes could not be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA notes that these concerns are addressed by 1910.132(d), as proposed and as promulgated. That provision requires
the employer to perform a hazard assessment. From the hazard assessment, the employer can determine what PPE is needed.
As to the example presented by the ATA, if it is determined through an appropriate hazard assessment that an employee
is not exposed to foot hazards, the employer would not have to provide this type of protection. As discussed above,
the hazard assessment provision allows employers the flexibility to choose the PPE that is appropriate for a particular
workplace situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ALCOA comment, OSHA notes that if it is determined through a hazard assessment that electrical workers
are not exposed to the hazard of sharp objects puncturing the soles of shoes (which would be the case in many instances),
the protective footwear would not have to provide this type of protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, if it is determined through a hazard assessment that employees are exposed both to electrical and
puncture hazards, the employer would be required to ensure that employees wear shoes which protect the employees
from both hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the 1983 and 1991 editions of ANSI Z41 set criteria for protection of feet from electrical hazards. While proposed
1910.136(b) required that footwear be designed to either comply with Z41&hyph;1983 or be demonstrated to provide
equivalent protection, proposed 1910.136(a) did not explicitly require that employees wear foot protection against
electrical hazards. The Agency had intended proposed paragraphs (a) and (b) to be consistent and to reflect the 1983
edition of ANSI Z41. While employers are already required to protect employees from electrical hazards under existing
1910.132, OSHA believes that guidance regarding foot protection against electrical hazards will be clearer and
more useful if it appears in 1910.136. OSHA has revised proposed 1910.136(a) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In paragraph (b) of 1910.136, OSHA proposed that the design of protective footwear comply with the requirements of
ANSI Z41&hyph;1983, or be of a design which has been demonstrated to be equally effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 49, 59, 67, 72, 105, 118, 123) supported the adoption of the ANSI standard for
foot protection (ANSI Z41). Further, several commenters (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 67, 82, 84) suggested that OSHA adopt by reference
the ``updated'' or ``current'' edition of ANSI Z41. For example, Footwear Industries of America (FIA) (Ex. 3: 67,
pg. 2) remarked: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FIA therefore agrees with OSHA's proposal to update its personal protective equipment standard for foot protection
to comply with the improvements made in the ANSI standard. The Agency should note, however, that the 1983 version of
the ANSI Z41 standard may soon be replaced by an updated set of industry standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIA suggests that OSHA may wish to await the 1990 version of ANSI Z41 rather than to incorporate a seven-year old, nearly
outdated standard into 29 C.F.R. 1910.136.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency notes that the 1991 edition of the ANSI standard for foot protection has, in fact, replaced the 1983 edition
of ANSI Z41 referenced by OSHA in proposed 1910.136(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to reference the current 1991 edition of ANSI Z41 in 1910.136(b) of the final
rule because that edition imposes essentially the same requirements as the 1983 edition, except that the 1991 edition
provides more specific performance requirements for resistance to compressive forces and standardizes the puncture
resistance testing method. OSHA believes, based on its review of the pertinent ANSI standards and of the protective
footwear currently available, that compliance with the referenced requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 will not
result in disallowing foot protection that would have complied with the requirements of ANSI Z41&hyph;1983. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, OSHA has determined that it is appropriate to provide explicitly for the continued use of foot
PPE purchased prior to the effective date of the final rule, as long as it complies with the ANSI standard (ANSI Z41.1&hyph;1967)
referenced by existing 1910.136. Therefore, the Agency has redesignated proposed paragraph (b) as paragraph (b)(1)
of the final rule, and has added ``grandfathering'' text in paragraph (b)(2) of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter from the Tennessee Valley Authority (Ex. 3: 79) observed that OSHA proposed to incorporate only the design
requirements of the referenced ANSI standards and not the selection requirements, guidelines, and other general
information contained in the documents. As explained above in the preamble, OSHA acknowledges that the proposal
did not clearly express the Agency's intent to reference the ANSI standards in their entirety and is revising proposed
paragraph (b) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incorporation by reference of the pertinent ANSI standards has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register,
in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) has been
revised so that paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of the final rule reflect that approval and provide the requisite information
regarding access to the text of those ANSI standards.

1910.138 Hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 5 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3414), requested testimony, comments and information regarding the need for regulation
of additional types of PPE. Specifically, the Agency stated that it was considering the appropriateness of promulgating
requirements for hand protection (gloves) and skin protection (chemical protective clothing). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's concern with respect to hand protection and chemical protective clothing arose from information contained
in the record (e.g. Ex. 6: 2, 3, 4, 5), which indicates that a large number of employee injuries are occurring due to the
lack of adequate protection from hand and skin hazards. Additionally, neither OSHA or ANSI currently have criteria
for hand protection nor for chemical protective clothing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While OSHA received some information pertaining to chemical protective clothing, most of the rulemaking participants
who addressed Issue 5 focused their remarks on gloves. Those rulemaking participants suggested that OSHA provide
performance criteria and test methods for gloves and provide better guidance for the selection of gloves. They stated
that in many instances gloves are not being worn, and when gloves are worn, they are often the wrong type of glove for
the application involved (e.g. Ex. 3: 114; Ex. 7: 33, 38, 42; Ex. 53; Tr. 213&hyph;236: 4/3; Tr. 13&hyph;20: 4/4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For instance, a commenter from the United Steelworkers of America (Ex. 3: 114, pg. 2) said: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Protective clothing and gloves: OSHA should also set standards for these items since so many gloves do not work with
some chemicals and last longer with other chemicals.

Boeing supports the position that additional guidelines related to body and hand protection are necessary in 1910.132.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I go into a lot of plants throughout the country and site visits and the first thing I do is I look at the OSHA 200 log. I see
many cases of occupational dermatitis. My first assumption was these people are not wearing gloves. After further
investigation once I'm in that facility, I find out that the workers are wearing gloves, but they're wearing the wrong
glove for the application involved. So, this really needs to be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency also received some useful information about the various types of gloves and types of hazards for which they
should be used; the composition of the various types of gloves; and, other helpful information (Ex. 3: 27). There were
also some informative studies submitted to the record concerning the hand and skin hazards posed by certain chemicals
(Ex. 42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful evaluation of the rulemaking record, OSHA has concluded that the high incidence of hand injuries, together
with evidence that hand protection either is not being worn by employees or is being worn for the wrong type of hazards,
warrants the inclusion of more detailed requirements for selection and wearing of hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a new section, 1910.138, is being added to the final rule to address hand protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) requires that employers select, and that employees use, appropriate hand protection. In addition,
paragraph (a) identifies some of the types of hazards for which hand protection must be worn by employees. These include
hand hazards and potential hand hazards from skin absorption of harmful substances; severe cuts or lacerations;
severe abrasions; punctures; chemical burns; thermal burns; and harmful temperature extremes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) addresses the selection of the appropriate type of hand protection for the hazard or potential hazard
that is present at the workplace. The purpose of this provision is to assure that employees are using the appropriate
type of gloves for the tasks to be performed. For example, foundry workers generally must wear gloves that provide
thermal protection, while meat cutters must wear gloves that protect against cuts. While the selection of the appropriate
type of glove for a certain task or hazard may seem to be obvious, the rulemaking record indicates that many hand injuries
have occurred because the wrong type of glove was used for a certain task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Therefore, OSHA has determined that employers need more explicit guidance in determining what hand protection their
employees need. The Agency anticipates that compliance with this provision will assure that employees use the appropriate
type of hand protection for the assigned tasks and the identified hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has also added information to Appendix B of the final rule regarding the selection of appropriate hand protection.

Third party certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM (54 FR 33835), OSHA solicited comments on whether or not the Agency should require third party certification
of PPE. OSHA indicated that it would consider promulgating such a provision to ensure that PPE meets OSHA standards.
In addition, Issue 2 of the hearing notice (55 FR 3413) solicited testimony, with supporting information, regarding
the extent to which third party certification of PPE required by Subpart I would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third party certification issue generated more response than any other subject covered by this rulemaking. Many
of the participants in this rulemaking supported third party certification (e.g. Ex. 3: 3, 16, 27, 37, 83, 90, 92, 98,
114, 120, 123; Ex. 7: 3, 18, 20; Tr. 55: 4/3; Tr. 92&hyph;97: 4/3; Tr. 6&hyph;7: 4/4; Ex. 49). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In supporting third party certification, a commenter from MSA (Ex. 3: 18) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to provide user companies with assurances that personal protective equipment meets the appropriate standards,
we think it would be highly desirable for OSHA to require third-party certification of PPE. We think a program such
as the one offered by the Safety Equipment Institute that provides independent testing and quality assurance audits
is extremely valuable and adds minimum cost to safety equipment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Our experience supports the use of third-party certification as positive assurance that the products covered by
a program do, in fact, meet the standards to which they are tested, and that follow-up inspections verify that they
continue to meet the requirements. Third-party certification programs offer the user of personal protective equipment
a positive pledge that the product has been designed and manufactured to provide the protection needed. It further
simplifies the selection process by way of readily available lists of complying products and recognizable labels
and marks on them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although we are not prepared to give detailed estimates of costs of third-party certification for the various products,
the fees are not burdensome, even on small businesses. The equipment must be tested, whether it is in a program or not;
therefore, that cost is present in either case. The administration of a simple yet effective program with follow-up
factory inspection would probably not exceed $1,500&hyph;2,000 per year per plant based on some similar programs
we operate. Obviously, there are many types of programs, and the fees will vary dependent on the level of services rendered.

SEI's program of periodic quality assurance audits and product testing is now widely accepted by industry and government.
Over two hundred organizations and federal agencies require the SEI certification as a condition of procurement
for PPE. SEI combines both compliance testing of product and periodic quality assurance audits of manufacturers'
production facilities. These activities are performed under SEI direction by independent third parties to maintain
an objective program.

We feel that third party certification, akin to that currently required for respiratory protection, should be mandated
by the proposed rule. Such certification would guarantee that equipment was thoroughly tested prior to its being
relied on to provide safety for workers who may daily, or even occasionally, encounter hazardous situations.

A hearing participant from the Industrial Safety

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether the third party certification is performed by private or governmental entity, ISEA supports its use as a means
of confirming the quality of products made for the protection of workers. In the absence of government standards and
certification of compliance, ISEA endorses third party certification of compliance with ANSI standard Z87.1, 1989,
and Z89.1, 1986. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that the additional cost involved for manufacturers of personal protective equipment to obtain certification
is minimal, as is reflected by the number of eye and face protection devices and industrial helmets which are already
certified by the Safety Equipment Institute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third party certification costs are averaged over the volume of units sold, and we believe end up as an insignificant
cost increase.

Other rulemaking participants expressed concerns with the concept of third party certification. One concern expressed
by several rulemaking participants (e.g. Ex. 3: 28, 79, 87, 105) was the belief that OSHA envisioned requiring employers,
rather than manufacturers of the PPE, to obtain the third party certification. That was not the Agency's intent. OSHA
notes that the manufacturer of the PPE, not the purchaser/user, is, in general, the party who is in the appropriate
position to have products tested and evaluated. OSHA's intention regarding the duty of employers was to reaffirm
the employer's responsibility to purchase and have employees use only PPE that would meet the requirements of the
pertinent standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rulemaking participants also expressed concern that it would be very difficult to have third party certification
of prescription safety eyewear (e.g. Ex. 3: 60, 71, 93, 115; Ex. 7: 11, 34; Tr. 184&hyph;191: 4/3; Tr. 206: 4/4; Ex. 50).
They asserted that third party certification would not be practical since the eyecare providers and prescription
laboratories, generally small businesses, who produce prescription eyewear would be unable to bear the burden of
third party certification. They also stated that each pair of prescription glasses is unique to the individual for
whom it was prescribed. Those rulemaking participants explained that lenses are tested by the manufacturer to meet
ANSI standards, and frames are tested to meet ANSI standards by the frame manufacturers. Those participants also
expressed the belief that this testing meets the intent of third party certification. OSHA notes that the assurance
provided by such procedures may be even better than that obtained through third party certification because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 lens and frame is tested, rather than the representative sample of eyewear that would be tested through a third party
certification program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the Optical Laboratories Association (OLA), stated (Ex. 3: 71, pp.1&hyph;2): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the position of OLA that third-party certification of devices utilizing lenses made to individual prescription
(Rx) is not feasible, and in fact would not guarantee the safety-level provided by the present system as prescribed
by Z87. This is so because third-party certification of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 would not be practicable, whereas under the present system 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
prescription lenses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 are subject to a rigorous test and the fabricator of each lens certifies, by its trademark, that the lens meets the standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore submitted that the existing system of separate testing of the frame and lenses of spectacles containing
prescription lenses meets OSHA's objectives and is practical. Further testing of the completed device after the
lenses are inserted would not be feasible. While the test may not cause a device failure, it may damage the lenses and
weaken the frame.

We do not believe that this [third party testing of prescription eyewear] is practical. Most industrial eyewear today
[is] prescribed. *&blank;*&blank;* each prescription pair of glasses is unique to the individual for which it was
prescribed and made. The common denominator is that prescription eyewear lenses are 100% tested to pass the industrial
eyewear requirements for primary protection, i.e., impact resistance. Further, frames are tested and marked by
the frame manufacturer to meet the requirements.

Other rulemaking participants opposed third party certification of PPE (e.g. Ex. 3: 65, 68, 99; Ex. 7: 1, 8, 39). For
instance, the belief was expressed (Ex. 3: 119) that the present voluntary system is adequate, particularly in light
of widespread concerns regarding product liability. In general, those opposed to third party certification believed
it would add cost, without adding any appreciable safety benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a commenter from the American Gas Association (Ex. 3: 46, pg. 13) stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We urge OSHA not to adopt such a requirement. Such certification would increase unnecessarily the incremental cost
of compliance while providing few, if any, benefits. Manufacturers who claim they are in compliance with the ANSI
standard could be subject to liability in cases where products fail to meet that standard. The cost of third party compliance
would be borne by the industry when the risk of liability should be sufficient to ensure compliance.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Third party certification of personal protective equipment by employers would be both costly to the manufacturer
and, subsequently, the employer. Additionally, it is not clear in the proposal as to how this requirement would enhance
the safety of the workforce. It would place an additional administrative and financial burden on both manufacturers
and employers, which does not seem to be justified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
MVMA strongly objects to the proposal of requiring third party certification for personal protective equipment.
We believe that personal protective equipment which meets the requirements of various safety standards such as ANSI
and the certification programs conducted by the Safety Equipment Institute are adequate to provide the assurance
that the PPE will meet the performance specifications necessary to protect an employee. To require a third party certification
will be redundant, costly and will not enhance the safety or performance of PPE.

In opposing third party certification, a commenter from Monsanto (Ex. 7: 16) said:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[W]e question whether third party certification will add any benefits in terms of protection for employees. It will
certainly add to the cost of such equipment. We believe that the manufacturers' written statement that their equipment
meets the requirements of the appropriate ANSI standard should be sufficient. Our perception is that this arrangement
has worked well over the years and we see no benefit in changing it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has carefully considered this issue and, after a thorough evaluation of all of the information contained in the
record, has concluded for several reasons, that it would not be appropriate to require third party certification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, while OSHA has recognized that third party certification of PPE can increase confidence in and use of PPE, a
requirement for such third party certification will not add to the inherent safety of the PPE tested and certified.
Also, given the extent to which the PPE industry has already voluntarily adopted third party certification, the Agency
believes that any benefit resulting from the addition of such a requirement would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, revised subpart I provides other means to determine if PPE meets the pertinent standard. In particular,
compliance with revised subpart I's performance-oriented requirements for hazard assessment, PPE selection,
and training will result in appropriate selection, use and maintenance of PPE by affected employees. For example,
the Agency expects that the training required in new 1910.132(f) will increase affected employee confidence in the
assigned PPE and, as a consequence, increase the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, OSHA believes, given the limited benefit expected from third party certification, that it would be unreasonable
to require that employers procure only PPE that has third party certification. Such a requirement would impose unnecessary
burdens on PPE manufacturers who can establish by other means that their products comply with the pertinent OSHA standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency believes that allocating the resources needed to implement and enforce a requirement for
third party certification would unreasonably detract from OSHA's ability to enforce the other provisions of revised
subpart I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is also adding non-mandatory appendices A and B to provide additional guidance to employers and employees
with regard to PPE for eye, face, head, foot, and hand hazards.

IV. Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Assessment of Revisions to Subpart I, Personal
Protective Equipment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1971, OSHA adopted its current standards for personal protective equipment (PPE) from national consensus standards
under section 6(a) of the OSH Act. Since then, advances in PPE technology have resulted in greater occupational protection
in workplaces where equipment innovations have been adopted. In this final rule, OSHA promulgates a nationwide standard
for PPE that reflects these improved means of hazard prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) requires that a Regulatory Impact Analysis be prepared for any ``significant
regulatory action''. A ``significant'' rule would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or state, local or tribal governments or communities. In addition, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) requires an analysis of whether a regulation will have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Finally, section 6(f) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act provides
that, where a party has challenged the validity of an OSHA standard in the Court of Appeals, the determinations of OSHA
(such as findings regarding the nature and severity of workplace hazards and the feasibility of identified abatement
measures) shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA determined, based on the Agency's Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1] and its review of the rulemaking
record, that the final rule for General Industry PPE is not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of
review under Executive Order 12866. However, in order to satisfy the various statutory requirements placed upon
the Agency and to further explain why OSHA has classified this regulatory action as ``non-significant'' for Executive
Order 12866 purposes, OSHA presents this Final Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility and Environmental Impact
Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Industry Profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a report prepared by Eastern Research Group under contract to the Department of Labor [2], OSHA has determined
that the hazards addressed by the personal protective equipment standard are present in varying degrees in virtually
all workplaces covered by the OSHA General Industry standards (29 CFR 1910). The extent of the rule's impact will vary
by industry depending on the hazards, the types of occupational activity and current practices regarding PPE use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many types of PPE have been in widespread use in industry for many years. However, until recently very little statistical
data existed to determine the number of employees who either are using PPE or who should be wearing PPE by virtue of the
hazards to which they are exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's inspection data document that approximately 3.5 percent of all planned safety inspections result in citations
under the existing PPE standards. The inspection data identifies the standard industrial classification (SIC)
of the establishment, size of plant workforce, union status, and information related to the inspection itself; less
frequently reported are data on degree of hazard present in workplaces, the number of workers exposed to the hazard,
or the type of PPE required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA examined injury statistics for affected industry sectors.
Among the accident databases searched by OSHA were Work Injury Reports (WIR) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS). These reports examine cases where a worker was injured and provide evidence that many workers are not wearing
adequate personal protective equipment. Based on the BLS data, relatively few firms with serious recordable injury
cases have performed a formal assessment of the potential hazards in their workplace. In addition, little training
was offered to workers regarding the importance of using protective equipment in these firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain accurate information on the need for personal protective equipment and the extent to which that need is being
met, OSHA conducted a national survey in 1989 [3,4,5]. The survey sampled 5,361 establishments, representing 1.1
million establishments in 61 SIC groups. The survey identified the hazards related to industrial processes and the
types of PPE required when working in or near these processes. The survey solicited information on PPE practices and
safety procedures and assessed whether engineering controls such as protective guards or overhead nets were in place.
Answers to survey questions were used to evaluate the appropriateness of PPE use. Survey questions also addressed
PPE training and hazard assessment. (See the background document and appendices in this docket for more detailed
information on the survey and supporting data related to this analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 shows the major industry groups covered by the PPE standard, the total number of affected establishments,
total affected employment, number of production employees and number of employees exposed to PPE-related hazards.
Of the 16.9 million production workers, the survey identified 11.7 million exposed workers within 1.1 million establishments
who should be wearing some form of PPE. These numbers are lower than was indicated in the PRIA, due to a refinement in
the analysis regarding affected population. Occupational categories identified by OSHA as having a significant
degree of required PPE use include craft, operating, maintenance and material handling employees. These categories
encompass most production employees and are most likely to be affected by this standard. However, as noted in the PRIA
[1, p. II&hyph;2&hyph;4], OSHA has previously estimated over a million other workers may also be exposed to hazards
requiring PPE use in the rest of general industry

As was indicated in the PRIA, while all general industry workers are potentially affected by these standards, exposed
workers are heavily concentrated in certain occupations and in certain industries. Building upon information provided
for the PRIA and comments to the record, this final analysis focuses on those groups of workers and industries judged
to have a heavy concentration of PPE use. In this analysis population at risk was determined by survey results indicating
a hazard that required the use of PPE. The PRIA had used the term ``population at risk'' to refer to all workers in two
``production worker'' job categories in general industry [1, p. II&hyph;1&hyph;5]. It should be noted that this
analysis in no way implies that other workers may not be exposed to hazards preventable by PPE, but simply that the great
majority are found in certain specific job categories and industries.

From survey results OSHA developed a profile of the affected population by exposed bodily area (anatomical part),
summarized in Table 2. As the table shows, almost 8.8 million workers are exposed to foot injury, while the potential
for hand injury exists for 4.7 million workers. Other anatomical parts covered by this rule are eyes (2.8 million workers
at risk), head (1.9 million workers) and face (381,000 workers).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing and revised standards for subpart I require personal protective equipment wherever necessary by reason
of the hazards of processes, environment or worker activity. New 1910.132(d) requires workplace hazard assessment
and new 1910.132(f) requires employee training in the use of PPE. The revised standards for eye and face protection,
protective headwear and foot protection update, prospectively, references to pertinent consensus standards.
OSHA expects that employers will be able to comply with the new and revised requirements without difficulty, because
the means of compliance are readily available and because the final rule ``grandfathers'' equipment that complies
with the existing standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA anticipates that the new requirements for hazard assessment, prohibition of defective and damaged equipment,
and employee training can be implemented with available technical personnel and other resources. OSHA's survey
probed the extent to which firms have already adopted the elements of a PPE program. Comments in the record were also
evaluated in order to establish current industry practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of evidence in the record, including results from the OSHA PPE survey, OSHA has determined that the final
PPE standard is both technologically and economically feasible.

Costs of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA estimated compliance costs using data on current practices and exposed population from the PPE survey. Aggregating
costs across industry sectors, OSHA estimates a total annual compliance cost of new provisions in the revised rule
will result in a cost of $52.4 million. Total compliance costs by industry sector are presented in Table 3.

OSHA's survey identified 433,149 establishments which need to take steps to come into compliance with the new provisions
for hazard assessment. (Of 825,265 affected establishments, approximately 47 percent already had a hazard assessment
program in place.) The cost to conduct hazard assessments was estimated to be $15.9 million per year, assuming a reassessment
is conducted once every five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new provision for PPE training would affect approximately 10.8 million employees estimated in need of PPE training,
at an annual cost of $36.5 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates for the cost of providing PPE training differ from those in Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis due
to comments received and results from OSHA's PPE survey. This information indicated that the problem of PPE non-usage
is considerably more widespread than originally estimated. Correspondingly, this indicated that the population
requiring PPE training was larger than originally estimated.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that the risk of fatality and injury to workers is unacceptably high among sectors affected by the revised
personal protective equipment standard. The revised PPE standard is designed to enhance compliance with existing
requirements and ensure future compliance related to a heightened level of hazard awareness and training. These
changes to the standard should help to eliminate or reduce accidents within industries subject to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standard has performance-oriented provisions addressing eye, face, hand, head and foot hazards that allow employers
to adopt the most up-to-date PPE for use in their establishment. The flexibility to substitute new materials and technologies
should produce more comfortable and protective PPE. An increase in worker acceptance and use of PPE should translate
into additional benefits. OSHA's expectation is that increased use of better equipment will prevent or lessen the
severity of many incidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to BLS statistics in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1989
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [6], there were a total of 1.6 million lost-workday cases and 1.8 million non-lost-workday cases during the survey
year. Eastern Research Group [7] analyzed survey-related data, which were used to extract the number of these injuries
that were related to use (or nonuse) of PPE. In turn, BLS Work Injury Reports were analyzed to estimate what portion
of those injuries related to inconsistent or inappropriate use of PPE, or lack of hazard identification. Injuries
prevented in significantly affected industry sectors are shown in Table 4. Since injuries will be prevented in some
other industry sectors as well, total estimates are conservative.

OSHA estimates that 712,000 lost workdays&sect;
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and 65,000 non-lost workday cases will be realized from compliance with requirements for employee training and workplace
hazard assessment. These benefits will be gained through selection of more appropriate PPE, increased awareness
of hazards and improved consistency in use. These benefit estimates exceed those of the PRIA because OSHA has determined
that current compliance with the PPE standards is poorer than was estimated in the PRIA. In addition, OSHA believes
these requirements will enhance compliance with existing requirements, thereby preventing more injuries; however,
the extent of these benefits are difficult to quantify.

Recent research by Arthur Oleinick identifies a possible underestimation of lost workdays when reference periods
are bounded by calendar years, as in the BLS survey. For elaboration of this point, see Oleinick [8].

OSHA also estimated the number of fatalities associated with the absence of personal protective equipment. From
an analysis of BLS, NIOSH and OSHA accident data, OSHA estimates that 125 fatal head injuries occur annually. While
most fatal head injuries are the result of crushing injuries, falls, explosions and other traumatic events beyond
the scope of this standard, some are preventable with the use of head protection. Based on a review of OSHA accident
abstracts and an understanding of the rule's scope and effectiveness, OSHA estimates that 4 head injury fatality
cases are preventable each year through compliance with the new provisions of the standard.

Cost Savings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon these estimated reduction in injuries, OSHA estimates that society will reap substantial economic benefits
from prevented injuries. Lost work time injuries can be particularly expensive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PPE is uniquely effective in preventing eye injuries, for example, which can be severely debilitating. Dr. Leonard
Parver [9, pp. 28&hyph;29] of Georgetown University's ophthalmology department elaborated on this cost to employers:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
These injuries tend to be very devastating. They have severe impact on the patient in terms of vision, and the costs
are phenomenal. We estimate the costs of hospitalizing these patients at $250 million per year. That's just for the
hospital stay; that doesn't include lost work days and compensation costs. This is a very significant problem, and
very, very preventable. We're not talking about reinventing the wheel here. We have the means of doing this. We have
adequate eye protective gear. It's a matter of educating the workforce that this is necessary.

While employers typically bear only a fraction of the costs related to injuries, these costs can be substantial. Employers
specifically will benefit from reduced lost production time, administrative time spent preparing insurance claims
and accident reports and replacing injured workers. Based on a 1981 study by Levitt and coworkers [10], OSHA estimates
the cost to employers from the average lost worktime injury is at least $4000
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
. This cost includes:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Levitt's wage rates were adjusted to reflect current wage conditions in general industry [11]. In light of the National
Safety Council estimates presented later in this document, given the debilitating severity of many PPE accidents
(eye, head), and the surge in workers compensation costs in recent years, an estimate of $4000 per injury is likely
to be conservative.

Other nonquantifiable costs associated with accidents, such as increased anxiety among non-injured workers, the
loss of employee goodwill towards the employer, and the impact on public perception of a company and its products were
not considered in the Levitt study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the Levitt study and the estimated 37,924 lost workdays prevented, OSHA estimates that the rule will save
firms over $150 million annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as noted above, the cost of workplace injuries is typically borne primarily by employees themselves. The
National Safety Council recently calculated the societal cost per lost worktime injury at $27,000 [7,p. 35], by factoring
in long-term wage losses, medical expenses, administrative expenses and miscellaneous employer costs. Applying
this figure to OSHA's estimate of 37,924 lost workday injuries prevented annually, revisions to this rule should
save society (employees, employers and third parties) over $1 billion annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates of the economic benefits of the rule may be conservative, since the benefits analysis focuses on injuries
prevented, not reduced severity of injuries. To the extent the rule results in nonlost workday injuries, as opposed
to disabling lost workday injuries, the economic benefits may be greater yet. In sum, OSHA estimates the rule will
save society over $1 billion annually, dwarfing the initial $52 million investment. Employers themselves should
save over $150 million through full compliance with revisions to the PPE standard, approximately three times the
estimated cost of compliance.

Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA analyzed the potential economic impact of the revised PPE standard and has determined that none of the major industry
groups subject to the standard would experience a significant economic burden as a result of compliance, even before
cost savings to employers are factored in. Table 5 presents average compliance cost, revenue, profit, and economic
impacts of the standard for establishments in affected industry groups. If all of the compliance costs are passed
through to the consumer, OSHA estimates that the average price increase would be negligible, less than 0.001 percent,
calculated as the ratio of total compliance cost to industry sales. The maximum price increase in any industry would
be less than 0.005 percent. Given the minuscule price increases necessary to cover these safety investments, employers
should be able to pass along compliance costs to their customers. However, even if all costs were absorbed by the affected
firms, the average reduction in profits would be approximately 0.01 percent, the largest being 0.06 percent. OSHA,
therefore, does not expect the revised standard to have a significant economic impact on affected firms or industries

In the Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis [1], OSHA analyzed the entire spectrum of affected industries, and
had determined no significant economic impact would result on establishments on any industry, with substantially
less impact in those establishments without heavy PPE use. This determination was reached even though the PRIA included
costs not directly attributable to the proposal, resulting in a total cost estimate which was nearly twice the cost
estimated in this final analysis. Accordingly, OSHA reaffirms that establishments in those industries will incur
minimal economic impact.

), OSHA also analyzed the economic impact on small establishments (19 or fewer employees), looking particularly
for signs that the rule would pose excessive burdens per employee, relative to impacts faced by larger entities. OSHA
has determined that, in relation to compliance with the standard, equipment purchases and labor utilization will
to a great extent depend positively on size of workforce; smaller firms are not expected to incur relatively higher
costs per worker. As shown in Table 6, OSHA estimates that the average price impact for small establishments will be
0.002 percent, while profit impacts will not exceed 0.04 percent under the assumption that all compliance costs are
absorbed by firms. These impacts are judged to be relatively minor; therefore, the PPE standard is economically feasible
for small establishments.

The revisions to the PPE standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321, et seq.), the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR part 1500
through 1517), and the Department of Labor's NEPA procedures (29 CFR part 11). As a result of this review, OSHA has determined
that the new PPE standard will have no significant environmental impact.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has described the hazards that require the use of PPE and the measures required to protect affected employees
from those hazards in Section I,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, above. The Agency is providing the following discussion of the statutory mandate for OSHA rulemaking activity to
explain the legal basis for its determination that the revised PPE standard, as promulgated, is reasonably necessary
to protect affected employees from significant risks of injury and death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2(b)(3) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act authorizes ``the Secretary of Labor to set mandatory 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational safety and health standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applicable to businesses affecting interstate commerce'', and section 5(a)(2) provides that ``[e]ach employer
shall comply with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
occupational safety and health standards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 promulgated under this Act'' (emphasis added). Section 3(8) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  652(8)) provides that ``the
term 'occupational safety and health standard' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use
of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide
safe or healthful employment and places of employment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In two recent cases, reviewing courts have expressed concern that OSHA's interpretation of these provisions of the
OSH Act, particularly of section 3(8) as it pertains to safety rulemaking, could lead to overly costly or under-protective
safety standards. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991), the District of Columbia Circuit rejected substantive challenges to OSHA's lockout/tagout
standard and denied a request that enforcement of that standard be stayed, but it also expressed concern that OSHA's
interpretation of the OSH Act could lead to safety standards that are very costly and only minimally protective. In

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Grain &amp; Feed Ass'n v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717 (5th Cir. 1989), the Fifth Circuit concluded that Congress gave OSHA considerable discretion in structuring
the costs and benefits of safety standards but, concerned that the grain dust standard might be under-protective,
directed OSHA to consider adding a provision that might further reduce significant risk of fire and explosion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA rulemakings involve a significant degree of agency expertise and policy-making discretion to which reviewing
courts must defer. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Building &amp; Constr. Trades Dep't, AFL-CIO v. Brock
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1266 (D.C. Cir. 1988); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 655 n. 62 (1980).) At the same time, the agency's technical expertise and policy-making authority must
be exercised within discernable parameters. The lockout/tagout and grain handling standard decisions sought clarification
of the agency's view of the scope of its expertise and authority. In light of those decisions, the preamble to this safety
standard states OSHA's views regarding the limits of its safety rulemaking authority and explains why the Agency
is confident that its interpretive views have in the past avoided regulatory extremes and continue to do so in this
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stated briefly, the OSH Act requires that, before promulgating any occupational safety standard, OSHA demonstrate
based on substantial evidence in the record as a whole that: (1) the proposed standard will substantially reduce a
significant risk of material harm; (2) compliance is technologically feasible in the sense that the protective measures
being required already exist, can be brought into existence with available technology, or can be created with technology
that can reasonably be developed; (3) compliance is economically feasible in the sense that industry can absorb or
pass on the costs without major dislocation or threat of instability; and (4) the standard is cost effective in that
it employs the least expensive protective measures capable of reducing or eliminating significant risk. Additionally,
proposed safety standards must be compatible with prior agency action, must be responsive to significant comment
in the record, and, to the extent allowed by statute, must be consistent with applicable Executive Orders. These elements
limit OSHA's regulatory discretion for safety rulemaking and provide a decision-making framework for developing
a rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Congress concluded that OSHA regulations are necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that
employers should be required to reduce or eliminate significant workplace health and safety threats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At section 2(a) of the OSH Act (29 U.S.C.  651(a)), Congress announced its determination that occupational injury
and illness should be eliminated as much as possible: ``The Congress finds that occupational injury and illness arising
out of work situations impose a substantial burden upon, and are a hindrance to, interstate commerce in terms of lost
production, wage loss, medical expenses, and disability compensation payments.'' Congress therefore declared
``it to be its purpose and policy *&blank;*&blank;* to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation
safe *&blank;*&blank;* working conditions [29 U.S.C.  651(b)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To that end, Congress instructed the Secretary of Labor to adopt existing federal and consensus standards during
the first two years after the OSH Act became effective and, in the event of conflict among any such standards, to ``promulgate
the standard which assures the greatest protection of the safety or health of the affected employees [29 U.S.C.  655(a)].''
Congress also directed the Secretary to set mandatory occupational safety standards [29 U.S.C.  651(b)(3)], based
on a rulemaking record and substantial evidence [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(2)], that are ``reasonably necessary or appropriate
to provide safe *&blank;*&blank;* employment and places of employment.'' When promulgating permanent safety or
health standards that differ from existing national consensus standards, the Secretary must explain ``why the rule
as adopted will better effectuate the purposes of this Act than the national consensus standard [29 U.S.C.  655(b)(8)].''
Correspondingly, every employer must comply with OSHA standards and, in addition, ``furnish to each of his employees
employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause
death or serious physical harm to his employees [29 U.S.C.  654(a)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs
when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment. Congress viewed the costs of health and safety
as a cost of doing business*&blank;*&blank;*. Indeed, Congress thought that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

[T]he vitality of the Nation's economy will be enhanced by the greater productivity realized through saved lives

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When one man is injured or disabled by an industrial accident or disease, it is he and his family who suffer the most immediate
and personal loss. However, that tragic loss also affects each of us. As a result of occupational accidents and disease,
over $1.5 billion in wages is lost each year [1970 dollars], and the annual loss to the gross national product is estimated
to be over $8 billion. Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen's compensation
and medical expenses*&blank;*&blank;*. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress considered uniform enforcement crucial because it would reduce or eliminate the disadvantage that a conscientious
employer might experience where inter-industry or intra-industry competition is present. Moreover, ``many employers
-- particularly smaller ones -- simply cannot make the necessary investment in health and safety, and survive competitively,
unless all are compelled to do so [Leg. Hist. at 144, 854, 1188, 1201].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the statutory text and legislative history make clear that Congress conclusively determined that OSHA regulation
is necessary to protect workers from occupational hazards and that employers should be required to reduce or eliminate
significant workplace health and safety threats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. As construed by the courts and by OSHA, the OSH Act sets clear and reasonable limits for agency rulemaking action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has long followed the teaching that section 3(8) of the OSH Act requires that, before it promulgates ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 permanent health or safety standard, [it must] make a threshold finding that a place of employment is unsafe -- in the
sense that significant risks are present and can be eliminated or lessened by a change in practices [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Benzene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); emphasis was supplied in original].'' Thus, the national consensus and existing federal standards that Congress
instructed OSHA to adopt summarily within two years of the OSH Act's inception provide reference points concerning
the least an OSHA standard should achieve (29 U.S.C.  655(a)). As a result, OSHA is precluded from regulating insignificant
safety risks or from issuing safety standards that do not at least lessen risk in a significant way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act also limits OSHA's discretion to issue overly burdensome rules, as the agency also has long recognized
that ``any standard that was not economically or technologically feasible would 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a fortiori
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 not be `reasonably necessary or appropriate' under the Act. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industrial Union Dep't v. Hodgson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, [499 F.2d 467, 478 (D.C. Cir. 1974)] (`Congress does not appear to have intended to protect employees by putting their
employers out of business.') [

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
American Textile Mfrs. Inst. Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 513 n. 31 (a standard is economically feasible even if it portends `disaster for some marginal firms,'
but it is economically infeasible if it `threaten[s] massive dislocation to, or imperil[s] the existence of,' the
industry)].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By stating the test in terms of ``threat'' and ``peril,'' the Supreme Court made clear in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that economic infeasibility begins short of industry-wide bankruptcy. OSHA itself has placed the line considerably
below this level. (See for example, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ATMI
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 452 U.S. at 527 n. 50; 43 FR 27, 360 (June 23, 1978). Proposed 200 &mu;g/m3 PEL for cotton dust did not raise serious possibility
of industry-wide bankruptcy, but impact on weaving sector would be severe, possibly requiring reconstruction of
90 percent of all weave rooms. OSHA concluded that the 200 &mu;g/m3 level was not feasible for weaving and that 750 &mu;g/m3
was all that could reasonably be required). See also 54 FR 29, 245&hyph;246 (July 11, 1989); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 939 F.2d at 1003. OSHA raised engineering control level for lead in small nonferrous foundries to avoid the possibility
of bankruptcy for about half of small foundries even though the industry as a whole could have survived the loss of small
firms.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All OSHA standards must also be cost-effective in the sense that the protective measures being required must be the
least expensive measures capable of achieving the desired end (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 838 F.2d 1258, 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). OSHA gives additional consideration to financial impact in setting the period
of time that should be allowed for compliance, allowing as much as ten years for compliance phase-in. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 453 U.S. 913 (1981).) Additionally, OSHA's enforcement policy takes account of financial hardship on an individualized
basis. OSHA's Field Operations Manual provides that, based on an employer's economic situation, OSHA may extend
the period within which a violation must be corrected after issuance of a citation (CPL. 2.45B, Chapter III, paragraph
E6d(3)(a), Dec. 31, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reach the necessary findings and conclusions, OSHA conducts rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of
section 6 of the OSH Act. The rulemaking process enables the Agency to determine the qualitative and, if possible,
the quantitative nature of the risk with (and without) regulation, the technological feasibility of compliance,
the availability of capital to the industry and the extent to which that capital is required for other purposes, the
industry's profit history, the industry's ability to absorb costs or pass them on to the consumer, the impact of higher
costs on demand, and the impact on competition with substitutes and imports. (See

 generally.) Section 6(f) of the OSH Act further provides that, if the validity of a standard is challenged, OSHA must
support its conclusions with ``substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole,'' a standard that courts
have determined requires fairly close scrutiny of agency action and the explanation of that action. (See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's powers are further circumscribed by the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which
provides a neutral forum for employer contests of citations issued by OSHA for noncompliance with health and safety
standards (29 U.S.C.  659&hyph;661; noted as an additional constraint in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 at 652 n. 59). OSHA must also respond rationally to similarities and differences among industries or industry sectors.

, 838 F.2d 1258, 1272&hyph;73 (D.C. Cir. 1988).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA rulemaking is thus constrained first by the need to demonstrate that the standard will substantially reduce
a significant risk of material harm, and then by the requirement that compliance is technologically capable of being
done and not so expensive as to threaten economic instability or dislocation for the industry. Within these bounds,
further constraints such as the need to find cost-effective measures and to respond rationally to all meaningful
comment militate against regulatory extremes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards which regulate hazards that are frequently undetectable because they are subtle or develop slowly or after
long latency periods, are frequently referred to as ``health'' standards. Standards that regulate hazards, like
explosions or electrocution, that cause immediately noticeable physical harm, are called ``safety'' standards.
(See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 866 F.2d 717, 731, 733 (5th Cir. 1989). As noted above, section 3(8) provides that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA standards must be ``reasonably necessary or appropriate.'' In addition, section 6(b)(5) requires that OSHA
set health standards which limit significant risk ``to the extent feasible.'' OSHA has determined that the revised
PPE standard is a safety standard, because the revised PPE standard addresses hazards, such as molten metal, falling
objects and electricity, that are immediately dangerous to life or health, not the longer term, less obvious hazards
subject to section 6(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSH Act and its legislative history clearly indicate that Congress intended for OSHA to distinguish between safety
standards and health standards. For example in section 2(b)(6) of the OSH Act, Congress declared that the goal of assuring
safe and healthful working conditions and preserving human resources would be achieved, in part: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;*  by exploring ways to discover latent diseases, establishing causal connections between diseases
and work in environmental conditions, and conducting other research relating to health problems, in recognition
of the fact that occupational health standards present problems often different from those involved in occupational
safety.

[The Secretary] should take into account that anyone working in toxic agents and physical agents which might be harmful
may be subjected to such conditions for the rest of his working life, so that we can get at something which might not be
toxic now, if he works in it a short time, but if he works in it the rest of his life might be very dangerous; and we want to
make sure that such things are taken into consideration in establishing standards. [

In reviewing OSHA rulemaking activity, the Supreme Court has held that section 6(b)(5) requires OSHA to set ``the
most protective standard consistent with feasibility'' (

The reason that Congress drafted a special section for these substances *&blank;*&blank;* was because Congress
recognized that there were special problems in regulating health risks as opposed to safety risks. In the latter case,
the risks are generally immediate and obvious, while in the former, the risks may not be evident until a worker has been
exposed for long periods of time to particular substances. [

Challenges to the grain dust and lockout/tagout standards included assertions that grain dust in explosive quantities
and uncontrolled energy releases that could expose employees to crushing, cutting, burning or explosion hazards
were harmful physical agents so that OSHA was required to apply the criteria of section 6(b)(5) when determining how
to protect employees from those hazards. Reviewing courts have uniformly rejected such assertions. For example,
the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW v. OSHA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 938 F.2d 1310 (D.C. Cir. 1991) rejected the view that section 6(b)(5) provided the statutory criteria for regulation
of uncontrolled energy, holding that such a ``reading would obliterate a distinction that Congress drew between
`health' and `safety' risks.'' The Court also noted that the language of the OSH Act and the legislative history supported
the OSHA position (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Union, UAW
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 1314). Additionally, the Court stated: ``We accord considerable weight to an agency's construction of a statutory
scheme it is entrusted to administer, rejecting it only if unreasonable'' (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court reviewing the grain dust standard also deferred to OSHA's reasonable view that the Agency was not subject
to the feasibility mandate of section 6(b)(5) in regulating explosive quantities of grain dust (

that the standard is ``reasonably necessary or appropriate'' to protect employee safety.

, above, OSHA has determined that the non-use or misuse of appropriate PPE poses significant risks to employees and
that the provisions of the final rule are reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from those risks. The
Agency estimates that compliance with the revised PPE standard will cost $52.4 million annually and will reduce the
risk of the identified hazards (preventing 4 fatalities and 102,000 injuries annually). This constitutes a substantial
reduction of significant risk of material harm for the exposed population of approximately 22 million general industry
employees. The Agency believes that compliance is technologically feasible because the rulemaking record indicates
that the PPE required by the standard is already in general use throughout the industries covered by the standard.
Additionally, OSHA believes that compliance is economically feasible, because, as documented in the Regulatory
Impact Analysis, all regulated sectors can readily absorb or pass on compliance costs during the standard's first
five years, and economic benefits will exceed compliance costs thereafter.

OSHA assessed employee risk by evaluating exposure to PPE-related hazards in a large range of industries. The

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Section IV, above, presents OSHA's estimate of the costs and benefits of the revised PPE standard in terms of the Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) codes for the industries regulated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency acknowledges that some industries covered by the revised PPE standard have more documented PPE-related
injuries or fatalities than do others. However, the record indicates that the hazards addressed by the standard exist
throughout general industry. OSHA does not believe that the significance of the risk associated with exposure to
PPE-related hazards within a given SIC classification is dependent on the number of incidents documented for that
particular industry sector. OSHA has set the scope of the revised PPE standard to address those situations where employees
are exposed to PPE-related hazards, regardless of the relative frequency of incidents. The Agency believes, based
on analysis of the elements of the hazards identified, there is sufficient information for OSHA to determine that
employees in the covered sectors face significant risks related to the non-use or misuse of PPE. Therefore, the Agency
has determined that all employees within the scope of the revised PPE standard face a significant risk of material
harm and that compliance with the revised PPE standard is reasonably necessary to protect affected employees from
that risk, regardless of the number of injuries or fatalities reported for the SIC code to which the employer has been
assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate data analysis, OSHA has organized the pertinent injury and fatality information according
to the SIC code for the particular industry sectors where incidents have been reported. Given the limitations of the
OSHA database and the likelihood of misclassification (due, for example, to the difficulty of classifying contractors),
the Agency does not believe that the risks associated with the use or misuse of PPE vary according to the SIC code to which
employers have been assigned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has considered and responded to all substantive comments regarding the proposed PPE standard on their merits
in the Section III, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary and Explanation of the Standard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, earlier in this preamble. In particular, OSHA evaluated all suggested changes to the proposed rule in terms of their
impact on worker safety, their feasibility, their cost effectiveness, and their consonance with the OSH Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order No. 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987), regarding
Federalism. Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) preempts state laws relating to issues
on which Federal OSHA has promulgated occupational safety and health standards. Under the OSH Act, a State can avoid
preemption in issues covered by Federal standards only if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of, a plan for the
development of such standards and their enforcement. Occupational safety and health standards developed by such
Plan States must, among other things, be at least as effective in providing safe and healthful employment and places
of employment as the Federal standards. Where such standards are applicable to products distributed or used in interstate
commerce they may not unduly burden commerce and must be justified by compelling local conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal standard for personal protective equipment used in general industry addresses hazards that are not unique
to any one State or region of the country. Nonetheless, States with occupational safety and health plans approved
under section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own State standards to deal with any special problems which
might be encountered in a particular State. Moreover, because this standard is written in general, performance-oriented
terms, there is considerable flexibility for State plans to require, and for affected employers to use, methods of
compliance which are appropriate to the working conditions covered by the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In brief, this final rule addresses a clear national problem related to occupational safety and health in general
industry. Those States which have elected to participate under section 18 of the OSH Act are not preempted by this standard,
and will be able to address any special conditions within the framework of the Federal Act, while ensuring that the
State standards are at least as effective as that standard.

VII. State Plan States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 States and territories with their own OSHA approved occupational safety and health plans must develop a comparable
standard applicable to both the private and public (state and local government employees) sectors within six months
of the publication date of a permanent final Federal rule or show OSHA why there is no need for action, e.g., because
an existing state standard covering this area is already ``at least as effective as'' the new Federal standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These States and territories are Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut (plan covers only State and local government
employees), Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York (plan
covers only State and local government employees), North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee,
Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington and Wyoming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the effective date of the Federal final rule, until such time as a State standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA
will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these States.

(1) The employer shall assess the workplace to determine if hazards are present, or are likely to be present, which
necessitate the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). If such hazards are present, or likely to be present,
the employer shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Select, and have each affected employee use, the types of PPE that will protect the affected employee from the hazards
identified in the hazard assessment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Communicate selection decisions to each affected employee; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Select PPE that properly fits each affected employee.

Training
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) The employer shall provide training to each employee who is required by this section to use PPE. Each such employee
shall be trained to know at least the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) What PPE is necessary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) How to properly don, doff, adjust, and wear PPE; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The limitations of the PPE; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The proper care, maintenance, useful life and disposal of the PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each affected employee shall demonstrate an understanding of the training specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this
section, and the ability to use PPE properly, before being allowed to perform work requiring the use of PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the employer has reason to believe that any affected employee who has already been trained does not have the
understanding and skill required by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the employer shall retrain each such employee.
Circumstances where retraining is required include, but are not limited to, situations where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Changes in the workplace render previous training obsolete; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Changes in the types of PPE to be used render previous training obsolete; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Inadequacies in an affected employee's knowledge or use of assigned PPE indicate that the employee has not retained
the requisite understanding or skill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The employer shall verify that each affected employee has received and understood the required training through
a written certification that contains the name of each employee trained, the date(s) of training, and that identifies
the subject of the certification.

particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially injurious
light radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each affected employee shall use eye protection that provides side protection when there is a hazard from flying
objects. Detachable side protectors (e.g. clip-on or slide-on side shields) meeting the pertinent requirements
of this section are acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Each affected employee who wears prescription lenses while engaged in operations that involve eye hazards shall
wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in its design, or shall wear eye protection that can be worn
over the prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position of the prescription lenses or the protective
lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Eye and face PPE shall be distinctly marked to facilitate identification of the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Each affected employee shall use equipment with filter lenses that have a shade number appropriate for the work
being performed for protection from injurious light radiation. The following is a listing of appropriate shade numbers
for various operations.

* As a rule of thumb, start with a shade that is too dark to see the weld zone. Then go to a lighter shade which gives sufficient
view of the weld zone without going below the minimum. In oxyfuel gas welding or cutting where the torch produces a high
yellow light, it is desirable to use a filter lens that absorbs the yellow or sodium line in the visible light of the (spectrum)
operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
** These values apply where the actual arc is clearly seen. Experience has shown that lighter filters may be used when
the arc is hidden by the workpiece.

Appendix B to Subpart I_Non-mandatory Compliance Guidelines for Hazard Assessment and Personal Protective Equipment
Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix is intended to provide compliance assistance for employers and employees in implementing requirements
for a hazard assessment and the selection of personal protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Controlling hazards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 PPE devices alone should not be relied on to provide protection against hazards, but should be used in conjunction
with guards, engineering controls, and sound manufacturing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment and selection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is necessary to consider certain general guidelines for assessing the foot, head, eye and face, and hand hazard
situations that exist in an occupational or educational operation or process, and to match the protective devices
to the particular hazard. It should be the responsibility of the safety officer to exercise common sense and appropriate
expertise to accomplish these tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to assess the need for PPE the following steps should be taken: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Survey.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Conduct a walk-through survey of the areas in question. The purpose of the survey is to identify sources of hazards
to workers and co-workers. Consideration should be given to the basic hazard categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Penetration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Compression (roll-over) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Harmful dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Light (optical) radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sources.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the walk-through survey the safety officer should observe: (a) sources of motion; i.e., machinery or processes
where any movement of tools, machine elements or particles could exist, or movement of personnel that could result
in collision with stationary objects; (b) sources of high temperatures that could result in burns, eye injury or ignition
of protective equipment, etc.; (c) types of chemical exposures; (d) sources of harmful dust; (e) sources of light
radiation, i.e., welding, brazing, cutting, furnaces, heat treating, high intensity lights, etc.; (f) sources
of falling objects or potential for dropping objects; (g) sources of sharp objects which might pierce the feet or cut
the hands; (h) sources of rolling or pinching objects which could crush the feet; (i) layout of workplace and location
of co-workers; and (j) any electrical hazards. In addition, injury/accident data should be reviewed to help identify
problem areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Organize data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Following the walk-through survey, it is necessary to organize the data and information for use in the assessment
of hazards. The objective is to prepare for an analysis of the hazards in the environment to enable proper selection
of protective equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Analyze data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Having gathered and organized data on a workplace, an estimate of the potential for injuries should be made. Each of
the basic hazards (paragraph 3.a.) should be reviewed and a determination made as to the type, level of risk, and seriousness
of potential injury from each of the hazards found in the area. The possibility of exposure to several hazards simultaneously
should be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 After completion of the procedures in paragraph 3, the general procedure for selection of protective equipment is
to: a) Become familiar with the potential hazards and the type of protective equipment that is available, and what
it can do; i.e., splash protection, impact protection, etc.; b) compare the hazards associated with the environment;
i.e., impact velocities, masses, projectile shape, radiation intensities, with the capabilities of the available
protective equipment; c) select the protective equipment which ensures a level of protection greater than the minimum
required to protect employees from the hazards; and d) fit the user with the protective device and give instructions
on care and use of the PPE. It is very important that end users be made aware of all warning labels for and limitations
of their PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Fitting the device.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Careful consideration must be given to comfort and fit. PPE that fits poorly will not afford the necessary protection.
Continued wearing of the device is more likely if it fits the wearer comfortably. Protective devices are generally
available in a variety of sizes. Care should be taken to ensure that the right size is selected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Devices with adjustable features.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Adjustments should be made on an individual basis for a comfortable fit that will maintain the protective device in
the proper position. Particular care should be taken in fitting devices for eye protection against dust and chemical
splash to ensure that the devices are sealed to the face. In addition, proper fitting of helmets is important to ensure
that it will not fall off during work operations. In some cases a chin strap may be necessary to keep the helmet on an employee's
head. (Chin straps should break at a reasonably low force, however, so as to prevent a strangulation hazard). Where
manufacturer's instructions are available, they should be followed carefully. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Reassessment of hazards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is the responsibility of the safety officer to reassess the workplace hazard situation as necessary, by identifying
and evaluating new equipment and processes, reviewing accident records, and reevaluating the suitability of previously
selected PPE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(1) Care should be taken to recognize the possibility of multiple and simultaneous exposure to a variety of hazards.
Adequate protection against the highest level of each of the hazards should be provided. Protective devices do not
provide unlimited protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(2) Operations involving heat may also involve light radiation. As required by the standard, protection from both
hazards must be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(3) Faceshields should only be worn over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(4) As required by the standard, filter lenses must meet the requirements for shade designations in 1910.133(a)(5).
Tinted and shaded lenses are

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=12 g=1 f=1 -->
 filter lenses unless they are marked or identified as such. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(5) As required by the standard, persons whose vision requires the use of prescription (Rx) lenses must wear either
protective devices fitted with prescription (Rx) lenses or protective devices designed to be worn over regular prescription
(Rx) eyewear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(6) Wearers of contact lenses must also wear appropriate eye and face protection devices in a hazardous environment.
It should be recognized that dusty and/or chemical environments may represent an additional hazard to contact lens
wearers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(7) Caution should be exercised in the use of metal frame protective devices in electrical hazard areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(8) Atmospheric conditions and the restricted ventilation of the protector can cause lenses to fog. Frequent cleansing
may be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(9) Welding helmets or faceshields should be used only over primary eye protection (spectacles or goggles). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(10) Non-sideshield spectacles are available for frontal protection only, but are not acceptable eye protection
for the sources and operations listed for ``impact.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 007 0146 intable -->
(11) Ventilation should be adequate, but well protected from splash entry. Eye and face protection should be designed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for head protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 All head protection (helmets) is designed to provide protection from impact and penetration hazards caused by falling
objects. Head protection is also available which provides protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from electric shock and burn. When selecting head protection, knowledge of potential electrical hazards is important.
Class A helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance, provide electrical protection from low-voltage
conductors (they are proof tested to 2,200 volts). Class B helmets, in addition to impact and penetration resistance,
provide electrical protection from high-voltage conductors (they are proof tested to 20,000 volts). Class C helmets
provide impact and penetration resistance (they are usually made of aluminum which conducts electricity), and should
not be used around electrical hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where falling object hazards are present, helmets must be worn. Some examples include: working below other workers
who are using tools and materials which could fall; working around or under conveyor belts which are carrying parts
or materials; working below machinery or processes which might cause material or objects to fall; and working on exposed
energized conductors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some examples of occupations for which head protection should be routinely considered are: carpenters, electricians,
linemen, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and pipe fitters, assemblers, packers, wrappers, sawyers, welders,
laborers, freight handlers, timber cutting and logging, stock handlers, and warehouse laborers.

Selection guidelines for foot protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Safety shoes and boots which meet the ANSI Z41&hyph;1991 Standard provide both impact and compression protection.
Where necessary, safety shoes can be obtained which provide puncture protection. In some work situations, metatarsal
protection should be provided, and in other special situations electrical conductive or insulating safety shoes
would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety shoes or boots with impact protection would be required for carrying or handling materials such as packages,
objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and, for other activities where objects might fall onto the
feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection would be required for work activities involving skid trucks
(manual material handling carts) around bulk rolls (such as paper rolls) and around heavy pipes, all of which could
potentially roll over an employee's feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection would be required where
sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees
causing a foot injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some occupations (not a complete list) for which foot protection should be routinely considered are: shipping and
receiving clerks, stock clerks, carpenters, electricians, machinists, mechanics and repairers, plumbers and
pipe fitters, structural metal workers, assemblers, drywall installers and lathers, packers, wrappers, craters,
punch and stamping press operators, sawyers, welders, laborers, freight handlers, gardeners and grounds-keepers,
timber cutting and logging workers, stock handlers and warehouse laborers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection guidelines for hand protection.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Gloves are often relied upon to prevent cuts, abrasions, burns, and skin contact with chemicals that are capable of
causing local or systemic effects following dermal exposure. OSHA is unaware of any gloves that provide protection
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
all
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 potential hand hazards, and commonly available glove materials provide only limited protection against many chemicals.
Therefore, it is important to select the most appropriate glove for a particular application and to determine how
long it can be worn, and whether it can be reused. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also important to know the performance characteristics of gloves relative to the specific hazard anticipated;
e.g., chemical hazards, cut hazards, flame hazards, etc. These performance characteristics should be assessed
by using standard test procedures. Before purchasing gloves, the employer should request documentation from the
manufacturer that the gloves meet the appropriate test standard(s) for the hazard(s) anticipated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other factors to be considered for glove selection in general include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) As long as the performance characteristics are acceptable, in certain circumstances, it may be more cost effective
to regularly change cheaper gloves than to reuse more expensive types; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The work activities of the employee should be studied to determine the degree of dexterity required, the duration,
frequency, and degree of exposure of the hazard, and the physical stresses that will be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to selection of gloves for protection against chemical hazards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The toxic properties of the chemical(s) must be determined; in particular, the ability of the chemical to cause
local effects on the skin and /or to pass through the skin and cause systemic effects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Generally, any ``chemical resistant'' glove can be used for dry powders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) For mixtures and formulated products (unless specific test data are available), a glove should be selected on
the basis of the chemical component with the shortest breakthrough time, since it is possible for solvents to carry
active ingredients through polymeric materials; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Employees must be able to remove the gloves in such a manner as to prevent skin contamination.

Cleaning and maintenance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is important that all PPE be kept clean and properly maintained. Cleaning is particularly important for eye and
face protection where dirty or fogged lenses could impair vision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of compliance with 1910.132 (a) and (b), PPE should be inspected, cleaned, and maintained at regular
intervals so that the PPE provides the requisite protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is also important to ensure that contaminated PPE which cannot be decontaminated is disposed of in a manner that
protects employees from exposure to hazards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending for editorial purposes its regulations on the Inmate Financial Responsibility
Program, Non-discrimination Toward Inmates, and Civil Contempt of Court Commitments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final rule on the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (28 CFR 545.10 to 545.11) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 May 21, 1991 (56 FR 23477). This publication contained a typographical error (``Court-Ordered restriction'' rather
than ``Court-ordered restitution'') in &sect;545.11(a)(2). This document accordingly correctly revises that
paragraph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule on Non-Discrimination Toward Inmates (28 CFR 551.90) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 4, 1980 (45 FR 23366). This document amends &sect;551.90 to use the term ``disability'' instead of the term
``handicap''. This amendment is intended to conform to terminology used in current statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule on Civil Contempt of Court Commitments (28 CFR 522.10 to 522.11) was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 29, 1979 (44 FR 38244). This document amends &sect;522.11(g) to include reference to subsequent statutory citations.
This document also revises the authority citation for the part for the sake of editorial consistency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these amendments are editorial in nature and impose no new restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good
cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed
rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments
concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive
no response in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866,
and accordingly this rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations,
the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 Section 8(c)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 requires the Secretary to publish Fair Market Rents (FMRs)

Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subparts A and B), including space rentals by owners of manufactured
homes under the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (part 882, subpart F); the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation
program (part 882, subparts D and E); Section 8 housing assisted under part 886, subparts A and C (Section 8 Loan Management
and Property Disposition programs); and are used to determine payment standard schedules in the Rental Voucher program
(part 887).

HUD published proposed Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 FMRs for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program on May 6, 1993 (58 FR
27062) and solicited public comments for a 60-day period. The FY 1994 FMRs were the first to be developed with revisions
based on use of the 1990 Census data; they also included post-Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) and Random Digit
Dialing (RDD) telephone surveys. Because of the large number of requests in response to changes in the FMRs caused
by the Census data rebenchmarking, the public comment period was extended to August 31, 1993 by notice on July 6, 1993
(58 FR 36175).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 1, 1993, HUD published final FMRs for all areas, including over 600 areas that still had comments under review.
The FMRs for those areas were retained at the levels of the previous year (FY 1993) pending completion of the review
of the comments. This review has now been completed and today's notice announces final FY 1994 FMR schedules for the
areas under review. The FMR schedules for all areas are included in this notice to avoid the confusion of having more
than one publication of FY 1994 FMRs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (the Act) (42 U.S.C. 1437f) authorizes a housing assistance program
to aid lower income families in renting decent, safe, and sanitary housing. Assistance payments are limited by Fair
Market Rents (FMRs), or payment standards in the Rental Voucher Program, established by HUD for different areas.
In general, the FMR for an area is the amount that would be needed to rent privately owned, decent, safe, and sanitary
rental housing of a modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities. Section 8(c) of the Act requires the Secretary
of HUD to publish FMRs periodically, but not less frequently than annually, to be effective on October 1 of each year.
The FMRs must reflect changes based on the most recent available data so FMRs will be current for the year in which they
apply.

Metropolitan Area Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the May 6, 1993 publication of the proposed FMRs, HUD announced that the FMR area definitions, with several exceptions,
incorporated the changes made in the definitions of metropolitan areas by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB
Bulletin No. 93&hyph;05). The HUD exceptions were for nine large metropolitan areas whose revised OMB definitions
encompassed areas larger than what HUD considers appropriate for FMR area definitions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At that time, the metropolitan area definitions for both the Boston and New York-Northern New Jersey areas were still
under review by OMB. HUD decided, therefore, to continue using the previous definitions until OMB made its final decisions
and HUD could evaluate them. On June 30, 1993, OMB announced its revised definitions in OMB Bulletin NO. 93&hyph;17.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB's final decisions were, with minor differences, to return to the pre-1993 definitions for both the Boston and
New York-Northern New Jersey areas. For the Boston area, the only significant change was to combine the former Salem-Gloucester
PMSA with the former Boston PMSA to form the new Boston MA-NH PMSA. This change increased the FMRs for the Salem-Glouchester
area, but did not change the Boston area FMRs. For the New York-Northern New Jersey area, Pike County, Pennsylvania
was combined with Orange County, New York to form the Newburgh NY-PA PMSA. This had the effect of increasing the FMRs
for Pike County but did not change those for Orange County. Because these changes had no significant impact on HUD's
existing FMR areas, the October 1 publication adopted the revised OMB definitions of the Primary Metropolitan Statistical
Areas (PMSAs) that comprise the greater Boston and the greater New York metropolitan areas as the area definitions
for the final FY 1994 FMRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD also proposed in the May 6, 1993 publication to modify the FMR area definitions for seven other metropolitan areas
by deleting counties that OMB had added to its revised definitions. The decision to delete these counties was based
on an evaluation conducted by HUD headquarters and field staff. The counties deleted from the FMR areas are those that
are the most remote from the central cities/counties of the metropolitan area and have the lowest rents, in most cases
significantly below the FMR area rent averages. They are as follows:

The counties deleted from the FMR areas are included in Schedule B within their respective states as separate metropolitan
FMR areas. The only comments received concerning the revised FMR areas for the above areas were several from Lake County,
Illinois, requesting that it be designated a separate FMR area independent of the Chicago FMR area. On the basis of
its analysis, HUD has determined that Lake County is appropriately categorized as part of the Chicago housing market
area and should remain a part of the Chicago FMR area. HUD, therefore, has not changed the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB also modified the definitions of four other metropolitan areas in its final Bulletin. The four are: Augusta-Aiken,
GA-SC; Baton Rouge, LA; Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH; Wilmington, NC. HUD is implementing the new definitions
because the changes involved adding small counties that did not affect the FMRs or significantly alter the FMR area
definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD also proposed in the May 6, 1993 Notice that the FMRs for the independent cities and surrounding counties in Virginia
be established by combining the city and county data, rather than having separate FMRs for the cities and counties.
The final FY 1994 FMRs are based on the following FMR areas:

FMR Standard: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMRs are gross rent estimates; they include shelter rent and the cost of utilities, except telephone. HUD sets
FMRs to assure that a sufficient supply of rental housing is available to program participants. To accomplish this
objective, FMRs must be both high enough to permit a selection of units and neighborhoods and low enough to serve as
many families as possible. The level at which FMRs are set is expressed as a percentile point within the rent distribution
of standard quality rental housing units. The current definition used is the 45th percentile rent, the dollar amount
below which 45 percent of the standard quality rental housing units rent. The 45th percentile rent is drawn from the
distribution of rents of units are occupied by recent movers (renter households who moved into their unit within the
past 15 months). Public housing units and newly built units less than two years old are excluded.

Data Sources: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD used the most accurate and current data available to develop the FMR estimates. Three sources of survey data were
used as the basis for the base-year estimates. They are: (1) The 1990 Census; (2) the RDD telephone surveys conducted
since the Census; and (3) the post-1990 Census American Housing Surveys (AHSs) available up to the time the FMR estimates
were prepared. The base-year FMRs were then updated using Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for rents and utilities
or the HUD Regional rent change factors developed from RDD surveys. Annual average CPI data are available individually
for 95 metropolitan FMR areas. RDD Regional rent change factors are developed annually for the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan
parts of each of the 10 HUD Regions (a total of 20 separate factors). The RDD factors are used to update the base year estimates
for all FMR areas that do not have their own local CPI survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decennial Census provides statistically reliable rent data for use in establishing base-year FMRs. AHSs are
conducted by the Bureau of the Census for HUD and have accuracy comparable to the decennial Census. These surveys enable
HUD to develop between-census revisions for 44 of the largest metropolitan areas on a revolving schedule of 11 areas
annually. The RDD telephone survey technique is based on a sampling procedure that uses computers to select random
samples of rental housing, dial and keep track of the telephone numbers and tabulate the responses. RDD surveys are
designed to produce FMR estimates that are within two to four percent of the actual 45th percentile rent.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the proposed FY 1994 FMRs, HUD received over 2,500 comments covering more than 1,100 FMR areas. The first
publication on October 1, 1993 included final FMRs (held at the FY 1993 levels) for the areas for which the review of
public comments had not been completed. HUD announced in that publication that there would be a second publication
of FMRs for those areas and for those with RDD surveys still under review. The final count of FMR areas under consideration
was 669, including 40 FMR areas for which both public comments and RDD surveys were submitted. The areas under review
are identified in this publication with a ``+'' symbol next to the FMR schedule for the areas that had both comments
and RDD surveys; and with an ``*'' next to the FMR schedule for all other areas with comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD carefully evaluated all information submitted with the public comments. Based on this evaluation, the FMRs for
572 areas have been revised. This total includes revised FMRs for: 165 areas that were increased based on the survey
data submitted by the commenters; 39 areas that were increased as the result of RDD surveys; and 368 areas that submitted
incomplete information but that HUD was able to supplement with available information. The amount of the FMR increase
was not always the same as the amount requested by the commenters. For the 165 areas notified with survey data, the increases
sometimes differed because commenters requested a return to the FY 1993 FMRs even though their surveys showed something
different. In other cases, the survey data had to be re-tabulated and corrected; this resulted in revised FMRs that
are sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the requested modifications. The increases approved for the 368 areas,
with incomplete but usable data, generally were smaller than those requested by the commenter and generally applied
only to the one- and two-bedroom unit sizes. The information submitted for 97 FMR areas was not sufficient to provide
a basis for revising the FMRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters expressed their concern that owners would have to accept the reduced FMRs and would not renew leases
at a lower rent, and families would be forced to move. The Department wants to assure the PHAs administering the program
and the families that are currently participating in the Section 8 program that current participants will not be forced
to move or have to pay a higher portion of the rent. The rents specified in the housing assistance contract between the
owner and the PHA will continue to be paid by the PHA unless the owner requests a rent increase in accordance with the
provisions of the housing assistance contract. In such cases, the rent increase will be calculated using the annual
adjustment factors and will be approved by the PHA if the new rent does not exceed the amount of rent charged for comparable
unassisted units. The amount of rent the family pays will continue to be based on the family's income, and for families
in the rental voucher program the applicable payment standard. The new FMRs will be used for new families entering
the program or for current participants when they move to a new unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, PHA officials expressed concern about the impact that the reduced FMRs would have on administrative
fees and, therefore, their continuing capacity to administer the program. The calculation of PHA administrative
fees for FY 1994 is subject to a recent statutory change. FY 1994 administrative fees are calculated using the FY 1993
FMRs if there was a decrease in the FMRs. However, if the FY 1994 FMRs are higher, the law limited the fee increase to 3.5
percent above the FY 1993 fee. HUD Notice PIH&hyph;93&hyph;66(HA), which was issued on December 16, 1993, contains
detailed information on how FY 1994 administrative fees should be calculated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both HUD and PHAs used RDD telephone surveys to test the reliability of the proposed FY 1994 FMRs in areas with large
decreases proposed in FY 1994 FMRs. Of the 46 HUD RDD surveys completed since the proposed FMRs were published, 21 had
results that were higher than the proposed FMRs and 24 had results that were lower or not statistically different.
FMRs for eighteen areas were increased based on the results of PHA-funded RDD surveys. PHAs that funded surveys which
produced FMR estimates below those proposed opted not to comment, so comparative data are not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the areas where RDD survey FMRs are higher than the proposed FMRs, the FMRs published for effect are based on the
RDD surveys. The FY 1993 FMRs and the proposed and final FY 1994 FMRs for these areas are as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD continues to recommend use of RDD surveys to test the accuracy of FMRs for areas where there is a sufficient number
of Section 8 units to justify the survey cost of $12,000&hyph;$20,000. Areas with 500 or more units meet this criterion,
and areas with fewer units may meet it if the actual two-bedroom FMR rent standard is significantly different than
that proposed by HUD. Interested organizations concerned about FMR accuracy may wish to begin contracting for an
RDD survey in the next few months to assure that the results will be available in time to be incorporated into the FY 1995
FMRs. It takes two to three months to obtain survey rent estimates after contract award. The ``PHA Guide To Conducting
A Fair Market Rent Telephone Survey'' is available from HUD USER by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;245&hyph;2691. This
guide provides information on whether a PHA should consider using this approach, and it includes a draft contractor
solicitation letter and a Contract Statement of Work.

FMRs for Flood Damaged Areas in the Midwest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the authority granted in 24 CFR part 899, the Secretary finds good cause to waive the regulatory requirements
that govern requests for geographic area FMR exceptions for the flood areas that were declared Federal disaster areas.
Recognizing that there are a large number of FMR areas that experienced substantial losses as a result of the floods
of the past summer in the midwestern states which will have a direct effect on local rent levels, HUD is prepared to grant
FMR exceptions under the following conditions. FMR exceptions up to 10 percent above the final FY 1994 FMRs may be approved
for single-county FMR areas and for individual county parts of multi-county FMR areas. The flood-related FMR exceptions
will be approved by the HUD field office with jurisdiction on the grounds that: (1) The affected counties qualify as
disaster areas under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; and (2) the PHA certifies
that demand pressures and/or damage to the rental housing stock is so substantial that it has resulted in an increase
in the prevailing rent levels. Such exceptions must be requested in writing by the responsible PHAs. The exceptions
approved for this special disaster-related purpose will remain in effect until superseded by final FY 1995 FMRs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment as required by the National Environmental Policy
Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4374) is unnecessary, since the Section 8 Rental Certificate program is categorically
excluded from the Department's National Environmental Policy Act procedures under 24 CFR 50.20(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The undersigned, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), hereby certifies that this
notice does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because FMRs do not change
the rent from that which would be charged if the unit were not in the Section 8 program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order No. 12606, The Family, has determined that
this notice will not have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, or well-being. The notice amends
Fair Market Rent schedules for various Section 8 assisted housing programs, and does not affect the amount of rent
a family receiving rental assistance pays, which is based on a percentage of the family's income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order No. 12611, Federalism, has
determined that this notice will not involve the preemption of the State law by Federal statute or regulation and does
not have Federalism implications. The Fair Market Rent schedules do not have any substantial direct impact on States,
on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibility
among the various levels of government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.156, Lower-Income Housing Assistance Program (section
8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Fair Market Rent Schedules, which will not be codified in 24 CFR Part 888, are amended as follows:

a. FMRs for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (Schedule B) are established for Metropolitan Statistical Areas
(MSAs), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs), other HUD-designated metropolitan FMR areas. FMRs also
are established for nonmetropolitan counties and county equivalents in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin
Islands and the Pacific Islands and for nonmetropolitan parts of counties in the New England states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. FMRs for the areas in Virginia shown in the table below are established by combining the 1990 Census data for the nonmetropolitan
counties with the data for the independent cities that are located within the county borders. Because of space limitations,
the FMR listing in Schedule B includes only the name of the nonmetropolitan County. The full definitions of these areas
including the independent cities are as follows:

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend regulations governing the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and
Children (WIC) to comply with the mandate of section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, enacted on August
14, 1992. Consistent with that legislation, this rulemaking would add homelessness and migrancy to the predisposing
nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would also alter the current WIC nutritional risk priority system by placing individuals certified
for WIC due solely to homelessness or migrancy in Priority VII, along with previously certified participants who
might regress in nutritional status without continued provision of supplemental foods. The use of Priority VII for
this latter group of individuals would remain a State agency option. However, State agencies would be required to
use Priority VII for homeless or migrant individuals who are certified solely due to their homelessness or migrancy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intended effect of this proposed rule is to allow categorical and income-eligible homeless or migrant individuals,
who lack any other documented nutritional or medical condition, to receive WIC Program assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions of this rule, all
applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the WIC Program, the administrative procedures are
as follows: (1) Local agencies and vendors_State agency hearing procedures issued pursuant to 7 CFR 246.18; (2) applicants
and participants_State agency hearing procedures issued pursuant to 7 CFR 246.9; and (3) sanctions against State
agencies (but not claims for repayment assessed against a State agency) pursuant to 7 CFR 246.19_administrative
appeal in accordance with 7 CFR 246.22; and (4) procurement by State and local agencies_administrative appeal to

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There have never been specific, direct regulatory barriers or prohibitions to the participation of the homeless
or migrants in the WIC Program. Both before and since the enactment of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435),
the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has actively promoted service to homeless and migrant populations. Further,
particular attention has long been focused in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1771 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), on the needs of special populations, e.g. migrants and Native Americans. Section 17(f)(19) of the Child Nutrition
Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1786(F)(19), requires that not less than nine-tenths of 1 percent of the sums appropriated any
fiscal year for special supplemental food programs be available for services to eligible members of migrant populations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an interim and a final rule on participation of homeless individuals in WIC, published in December 1989 and August
1992, respectively, the Department defined the term ``homeless individual'' based upon the definition provided
legislatively in section 212(a) of the Hunger Prevention Act, Public Law 100&hyph;435 (42 U.S.C. 1786(b)(15)).
This term identifies those otherwise eligible residents of specified overnight facilities who must be granted access
to WIC when caseload is available, provided such facilities meet conditions insuring that residents, and not the
facilities, benefit from the WIC Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The August 1992 final rule, 57 FR 34500 (August 5, 1992), amended the WIC regulations to require State agencies to include
in their State Plans of Program Operation and Administration a description of how they will provide Program benefits
to and meet the special nutrition education needs of homeless individuals (7 CFR 246.4(a) (6) and (9), respectively)
and disseminate information about program availability and eligibility to organizations serving the homeless
(7 CFR 246.4(a)(7)). The August 1992 final rule amended 7 CFR 246.10(f)(1) to allow States, upon approval by FNS, to
make substitutions for foods normally required in the food package in order to accommodate the special circumstances
of the homeless. Further, the August 1992 final rule amended 7 CFR 246.10(f) (2) and (3) to require that competent professional
authorities take into account the special needs and problems of homeless individuals when prescribing supplemental
foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FNS has also shared with State WIC agencies successful initiatives and targeting strategies employed by other States
to facilitate participation of homeless and migrant persons in the WIC Program. A number of State agencies have established
local agency clinics and WIC certification offices in hotels and facilities which house homeless and migrant families.
Other States have held statewide training sessions for their local WIC agencies to educate them about the special
problems most frequently encountered by homeless individuals, and how WIC can help to alleviate some of these problems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to a 1986 report to Congress by the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Government Operations,
families, especially those composed of women and children, are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population
nationwide (report cited by the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1992 Biennial Report to Congress on WIC and CSFP
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Commodity Supplemental Food Program)). Although the homeless have not been well studied relative to other population
groups, several studies have indicated that the homeless and migrants are predisposed to inadequacies in their diets
and in the medical care they receive. Homeless infants and children appear to be at higher risk of low birthweight and
malnutrition. (Chavkin, Kristal, Seabron, and Guigli, 1987). Studies have also found that a correlation exists
between homelessness in women and a general lack of prenatal care and poor pregnancy outcomes. Homelessness may also
impede access to health care services and other public assistance programs. Moreover, evidence indicates that homeless
children have high rates of delayed immunization, a higher risk of exposure to infectious diseases, and higher rates
of emotional and developmental problems. (Khan, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the difficulty in conducting research on the homeless, most studies have focused on the sheltered homeless.
The risks to unsheltered homeless mothers and children are likely to be somewhat greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recent study indicates that migrants suffer most if not all of the conditions identified above afflicting the homeless.
(Farmworkers Health for the Year 2000, 1992 Recommendation of the National Advisory Council on Migrant Health).
In addition, testimony before the National Advisory Council on Migrant Health of the Department of Health and Human
Services (DHHS) suggests that a lack of permanent housing also predisposes migrants to higher rates of infant mortality
than the general population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, FNS has incorporated into the WIC Program regulations various provisions with the expressed purpose
of addressing the unique circumstances of migrant farmworkers. State plans are required to include information
on how the State intends to provide program benefits to eligible migrant farmworkers and their families; State agencies'
nutrition education goals and action plans must include a description of the methods that will be used to meet the special
nutrition education needs of migrant farmworkers and their families; and, States must provide expedited processing
services to special nutritional risk groups such as migrant farmworkers and their families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the increased risks associated with homelessness and migrancy, the National Advisory Council on Maternal,
Infant, and Fetal Nutrition recommended in its 1992 Report to the President and Congress that section 17(b)(8) of
the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1786(b)(8), be amended to include homelessness and migrancy as predisposing
nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program. Congress and the President accepted this recommendation and, as
manifested in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;342, specifically identified
homelessness and migrancy as predisposing nutritional risk conditions for purposes of WIC Program eligibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Homelessness/Migrancy 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously stated, the current definition of a ``homeless individual'' in the WIC regulations is based on the legislative
definition provided in section 212(a) of the Hunger Prevention Act, Public Law 100&hyph;435 (42 U.S.C. 1786 (b)(15).
Specifically, 7 CFR 246.2 defines a ``homeless individual'' as ``a woman, infant or child who lacks a fixed and regular
nighttime residence; or whose primary nighttime residence is: A supervised publicly or privately operated shelter
(including a welfare hotel, a congregate shelter, or a shelter for victims of domestic violence) designated to provide
temporary living accommodation; an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intended to
be institutionalized; a temporary accommodation in the residence of another individual; or a public or private place
not designed for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes this definition, along with its current migrant farmworker definition, should accommodate
all individuals Congress intended to include in their references to homelessness and migrancy in section 204 of the
Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;342.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While Congress has specifically defined the term ``homeless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual'' for the WIC Program, section 17 of the Child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nutrition Act of 1966 does not contain a definition for the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``migrant'' or ``migrancy.'' However, section 17 uses the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``migrant'' (e.g. section 17(f)(1)(c)(iv)) and ``migrant farmworker'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g. section 17(d)(4)(B)). The Department has interpreted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' references to migrants in section 17 to mean only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migrant farmworkers and the latter term is currently defined at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 246.2. However, before assuming that its migrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
farmworker definition was sufficient to apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressional references to the term migrant, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined the definition of migrant(s) as used by other public and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private organizations and agencies concerned with migrants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migrant services. In each case, some reference was made to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural or seasonal nature of migrancy and movement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals for agricultural employment purposes. Based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparative analysis, the Department considered its current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of migrant farmworker adequate to accommodate all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' references and uses of the term migrancy as set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 204 of the Child Nutrition Amendments of 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
WIC Priority System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current WIC nutritional risk priority system was designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that persons at greatest health and nutritional risk are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served first with available program funds. The priority system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore follows a logical order of progression to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority for service. Applicants with documented nutritionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related medical conditions are served first, followed by those at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional risk due to inadequate dietary patterns. Finally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and as a State agency option, previously certified participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose nutritional status might regress without continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of supplemental foods are certified in Priority VII. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, State agencies would be required to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Priority VII pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants, and children who are certified at nutritional risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely because of their homelessness or migrancy. State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may also continue to use Priority VII to identify certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants who might regress in nutritional status without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued provision of supplemental foods. The placement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority VII of individuals certified solely due to homelessness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or migrancy should not be viewed as diminished concern for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. Rather, such a placement reflects the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to serve persons with the greatest medical and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional needs first. Priority VII will only be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classify those individuals who are homeless or migrants and have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no other documented medical or nutritional risk. These are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals who previously would not have otherwise qualified for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WIC Program benefits due to lack of nutritional risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the facts revealed in the aforementioned studies, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a high likelihood that homeless and migrant individuals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already being served by the WIC Program by virtue of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional risk(s). Proposed Priority VII will serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety net for homeless or migrant individuals who are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise eligible due to a lack of documented nutritional or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical risk conditions. However, like any other eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant, a homeless or migrant individual may be placed in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher priority if her/his nutritional/health assessment by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent professional warrants a higher placement in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority system. For example, a homeless or migrant individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose nutritional risk assessment reveals the presence of anemia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be placed in a higher priority category than a homeless or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migrant person with no other documented nutritional risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition who would be placed in Priority VII. This is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keeping with the aforementioned system of prioritizing WIC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service based on documented nutritionally or medically related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. Priority VII is the logical placement for homeless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and migrant individuals with no documented nutritional risks who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for the program due solely to homelessness or migrancy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not intend for Priority VII to be used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States as an administrative shortcut in certifying homeless and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migrant individuals. The Department expects that homeless and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migrant applicants will receive all the normal and necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health assessments that are routinely performed to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of a medical or nutritional risk which would determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their proper priority placement, and assist in identifying other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and social services to which such individuals may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that this proposed regulation might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require some States to modify their current reporting systems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate the revised Priority VII. As such, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to provide an implementation period adequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate the necessary system modifications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department notes that while Congress has found homelessness and migrancy to be conditions predisposing individuals
to nutritional risks, and this determination has been recognized by the placement of these individuals in a WIC nutritional
risk category, alcoholism and drug abuse, similarly recognized by Congress in section 17(b)(8), have not been accorded
similar treatment by the Department. The Department believes the distinction is warranted. Over the past several
years, the health and medical communities have come to accept alcoholism or drug addiction, in and of itself, as a nutritionally
related medical condition sufficient to warrant placement in one of the first three priorities in 7 CFR 246.7(e)(4).
The Department does not believe that the same can be said for homelessness and migrancy. Recognizing that most State
agencies classify individuals suffering from alcoholism or drug addiction as a Priority I, based on recent medical
research, the Department is considering seeking a technical correction to the WIC legislation to remove alcoholism
and drug addiction from the examples of ``predisposing'' nutritional risk conditions. This change would thus recognize
these conditions as independent nutritionally related medical conditions in the law, thereby adjusting legislative
language to reflect current medical knowledge.

This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA,
it has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy of
more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, or loan programs or rights
and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.3 billion
to $1.8 billion annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities,
would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency,
and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.

It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 107B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject
matter of this rule. The Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis referred to above determined that the 1995 Wheat
Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) will have no significant economic impact on small entities because the regulatory
burden on the affected entities would remain the same regardless of the determinations made by this action. Thus,
CCC certifies that this rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with section 107B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 wheat crop if it is determined
that the total supply of wheat would otherwise be excessive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of wheat to desirable
goals. A paid land diversion program is not considered because, given the allowed ARP percentages, it is not needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction to the acreage base
for the farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural resources conservation
program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, must be taken into consideration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Producers who knowingly produce wheat in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm plus any wheat acreage planted
in accordance with the flexibility provisions provided by section 504 of the 1949 Act are ineligible for loans and
purchases and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an ARP for the 1995 crop is in effect, the program must be announced no later than June 1, 1994. Adjustments in the announced
program may be made if it is determined that there has been a significant change in the total supply of wheat since the
program was first announced. These adjustments must be made no later than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 107B of the 1949 Act, not less than 60 days before the program is announced for a crop of wheat,
proposals for public comment on various program options for the crop of wheat are required to be set forth. Each option
must be accompanied by an analysis that includes the estimated planted acreage, production, domestic and export
use, ending stocks, season average producer price, program participation rate, and cost to the Federal Government
that would likely result from each option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the 1995 Wheat ARP, the Secretary will choose a specific ARP percentage from within a range established
by the estimated ending stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the 1994/95 wheat marketing year. If it is estimated that the
1994/95 S/U in percentage terms will be_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) More than 40 percent, the ARP shall not be less than 10 percent nor more than 20 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Equal to or less than 40 percent, the ARP may not be more than 0 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year at 24.0 percent is estimated to be well below 40 percent. Based on this estimate,
the 1995 ARP may be not more than 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides that the acreage reduction factor
for the 1995 crop of wheat may not be less than 5 percent. This provision does not apply if the beginning stocks of soybeans
for the 1991/92 marketing year are less than 325 million bushels or if the estimated S/U for the 1994 wheat crop is less
than 34 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current estimate of soybean stocks on September 1, 1991, is 329 million bushels. The estimated S/U for the 1994/95
wheat crop is 24.0 percent. Thus, under current supply and use estimates for soybeans and wheat, the minimum 5-percent-ARP
provision is not applicable.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to provide additional time for the public to comment on a proposal to supersede two airworthiness
directives that currently require the following on certain Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) 35 series airplanes:
Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; fabricating and installing airspeed limitation
placards; incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane flight manual (AFM); and installing stabilizer
reinforcements. Several comments received on the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) requested additional
time to respond to the proposed action. This proposed action would incorporate and update the procedures and applicability
of both AD's into one document. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent structural failure
of the V-tail, which could result in loss of control of the airplane.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that would apply to certain Beech 35
series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57760). The action proposed to supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02
R1 with a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2)
fabricating and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into
the airplane flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished
in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7,
or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance
manuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request an extension of the comment period in order to have additional time to respond to the actions
presented in the proposal. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the comment period for the proposal
should be reopened to allow the public additional time to comment on the proposed actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has altered the proposal to include additional information that was inadvertently left out or referenced
incorrectly when preparing the original notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). Before final rule action is implemented,
the FAA will evaluate all comments received in response to the original NPRM as well as this supplemental NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 35 series airplanes
of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1 with
a new AD that would require: (1) Checking the ruddervator static balance and adjusting as appropriate; (2) fabricating
and installing airspeed limitation placards; (3) incorporating certain airspeed limitations into the airplane
flight manual (AFM); and (4) installing stabilizer reinforcements. The proposed actions would be accomplished
in accordance with the instructions to either Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;3, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;5, 35&hyph;4016&hyph;7,
or 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9, as applicable and as specified in Beech Service Bulletin No. 2188, and the applicable maintenance
and shop manuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that approximately 10,200 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 40 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor
rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $27,540,000. AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02
R1, which both would be superseded by the proposed action, currently require the same actions as are proposed. This
proposed action incorporates and updates the procedures of both the current AD's into one document. With this in mind,
the proposed action would not provide any additional cost impact upon U.S. operators than that which is already required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under
Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034,
February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on
a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. One gear strut inflation system capable of inflating the gear struts to full extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Prepare the airplane for weighing in accordance with the Weighing Instructions in the Weight and Balance Section
of the Pilot's Operating Handbook/Airplane Flight Manual (POH/AFM). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Ensure that the scale and airplane are on a level hangar floor and the airplane is shielded from any wind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Inflate the main landing gear struts to the maximum extension and completely deflate the nose strut. Inflate the
tires to correct tire pressure as listed in the applicable maintenance or shop manual.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to modify the Class E airspace near Freeport, IL, to accommodate a new Nondirectional Beacon
(NDB) Runway 06 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) and a new Localizer (LOC) Runway 24 SIAP to Albertus
Airport, Freeport, IL. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed
to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect of this proposal is to provide segregation of aircraft
using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather
conditions. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace near Freeport, IL, to accommodate a new NDB Runway 06 SIAP and a new LOC Runway 24 SIAP to Albertus Airport,
Freeport, IL. This modification would increase the Class E airspace area radius from 6.4 miles to 6.5 miles. Controlled
airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect
of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions
from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to
provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace near Savanna, IL, to accommodate a new Very High Frequency Omnidirectional
Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME&hyph;A) instrument approach procedure to Tri-Township Airport,
Savanna, IL. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed to contain
aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect of this proposal is to provide segregation of aircraft using
instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions.
The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

The Proposal  
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace near Savanna, IL, to accommodate a new VOR/DME&hyph;A instrument approach procedure to Tri-Township
Airport, Savanna, IL. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing
the approach. The intended affect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach
procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area would
be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 14, 1994, the City of Middlesborough, Kentucky and the National Parks and Conservation Association petitioned
the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) of the United States Department of the Interior, to
designate an area located in the Little Yellow Creek (Fern Lake) watershed in Claiborne County, Tennessee, as unsuitable
for surface coal mining operations pursuant to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;87).
The petition was amended on February 22, 1994, and deemed administratively complete and accepted for processing
on March 15, 1994. A subsequent amendment with exhibits was received on March 16, 1994. The petition as accepted is
a 26 page document with 100 pages of exhibits and an amendment. An additional 18 pages were received as part of a second
amendment after the determination of completeness. The Federal Program for Tennessee, as administered by OSM, applies
to all surface coal mining operations in Tennessee including the processing of lands unsuitable for mining petitions
(49 FR 38874, October 1, 1984).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition area occupies approximately 3,780 acres of the Little Yellow Creek watershed in Claiborne County, from
the headwaters to the Tennessee State line and includes portions of Fern Lake. The petition boundary runs essentially
from the Tennessee State line at Kentucky Corner on Cumberland Mountain in a southwest direction along the crest of
Cumberland Mountain to a point at the watershed divide between Tackett Creek and Little Yellow Creek. The petition
boundary then crosses from Cumberland Mountain to the crest of Mingo Mountain across this watershed divide and proceeds
in a northeasterly direction until it intercepts the Kentucky/Tennessee State line. The boundary follows the State
line to the east back to Kentucky Corner.

A scoping comment period is intended to raise the relevant issues to be addressed by the combined document. OSM seeks
public comments in relation to the scope of issues to be addressed by the impact evaluation, including impacts and
alternatives that should be addressed. Written comments should be specific and confined to issues pertinent to the
petition. The public comments received during the scoping period will assist OSM in making decisions on the petition
evaluation and in preparing the PED/EIS. OSM believes that the proposed action is a major Federal action that may significantly
affect the quality of the human environment and may require the preparation of an EIS. OSM additionally gives notice
here that should information or analyses show that the proposed action does not require an EIS, it will terminate the
environmental impact statement process through an appropriate notice in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In many cases the most difficult obstacle to getting property into productive reuse after a base closes is environmental
restoration, because the Department of Defense cannot convey title to property until this is accomplished. The potential
exists that persons who are interested in developing the property could clean it more quickly and efficiently than
the government. This section provides a proposed rule which in its final form would allow the Department to transfer
a property for the cost of cleanup to persons who agree to perform the environmental restoration. If the estimated
value of the base exceeds the cost of cleanup, the buyer shall make up the difference. The Department of Defense and
the Environmental Protection Agency will continue to consult regarding the implementation of Public Law 103&hyph;160,
section 2908.

(j) Transfer of real property or facilities to persons paying the cost of environmental restoration activities on
the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In many cases the most difficult obstacle to getting property into productive reuse is environmental restoration,
because the Department of Defense cannot convey title to property until this is accomplished. The potential exists
that persons who are interested in developing the property could clean it more quickly and efficiently than the government.
This section proposes instructions to implement a new authority which allows the Department of Defense to transfer
a property for the cost of cleanup to persons who agree to perform the environmental restoration. If the estimated
value of the base exceeds the cost of cleanup, the buyer shall make up the difference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 2908 of Title XXIX of Public Law 103&hyph;160 authorizes the Secretary of Defense, at any time before December
1, 1998, to enter into agreements to transfer by deed, real property or facilities at closing installations to a person
who agrees to perform all required environmental cleanup, waste management, and environmental compliance activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The authority may be exercised in the following manner:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An agreement to transfer may be executed with any person, provided that person can demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Secretary concerned the ability to adequately perform all required environmental clean-up, waste management
and environmental compliance activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The property and facilities subject to the agreement must be located in an installation closed or to be closed
under a base closure law, as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and at the time the agreement is executed must
be available exclusively for the use, or expression of an interest in use, of a local redevelopment authority under
Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 2905. The reuse contemplated in the agreement must be consistent with the applicable
local redevelopment plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) The Agreement may be in any form and transfer any interest allowable under the law of the State in which the property
or facility is located provided, however:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The Agreement may not serve to transfer title by deed in violation of Section 120(h) of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Agreement must contain a stipulation that all environmental restoration, waste management and environmental
compliance activities required under Federal and State laws, administrative decisions, agreements (including
schedules and milestones), and regulatory agency concurrences, including those that become effective at any time
during the existence of the Agreement, shall be met by the person with whom the Agreement is to be executed. The environmental
restoration for the Agreement must include activities associated with cleanup of petroleum and its derivatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The Agreement shall contain any item or condition that the Secretary of the Military Department concerned considers
appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. Such terms or conditions may include, but are not limited
to, providing continued access to the property and facilities by the U.S. and State and local regulatory agencies;
limitations upon the use to which the property may be put; and, provisions requiring a bond or other form of financial
assurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The Agreement must contain a description of the information disclosed to the person to whom the property or facilities
will be transferred on the environmental restoration, waste management and environmental compliance requirements
and activities relevant to the property or facilities. This description shall include any specific information
required by the notice requirements of Section 120(h)(1) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9620(h)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The Agreement should disclose to the person to whom the property or facilities will be transferred that the U.S.
will not indemnify, hold harmless or defend that person pursuant to Public Law 102&hyph;484, section 330, as amended
by Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 1002.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The Agreement may provide for a transfer to occur at any point after all remedial action necessary to protect human
health and the environment has been constructed and installed by the person and the remedy has been demonstrated to
the Military Department concerned and EPA to be operating properly and successfully.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The consideration for the Agreement must equal the estimated fair market value of the property or facilities
to be transferred, as determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. The consideration may be
in the form of the expected costs of all environmental restoration, waste management, and environmental compliance
activities to be paid by the recipient of the property or facilities. If such expected costs are lower than the estimated
fair market value of the property or facilities, the Secretary concerned shall obtain the difference in other consideration
satisfactory to the Secretary concerned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Before executing any Agreement authorized by Public Law 103&hyph;160, section 2908 the Secretary concerned
must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Disclose to the person to whom the property or facilities shall be transferred any information under the control
of the Secretary regarding the environmental restoration, waste management and environmental compliance activities
that relate to the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Conduct an Environmental Baseline Survey to determine whether there are impediments to the ultimate transfer
of the property.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Make the certification to Congress required by Public Law 103&hyph;60, section 2908.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Ensure the consultation with the affected governor and local communities required by a base closure law, as defined
in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, has been conducted.

 In this action, the EPA proposes approval of the State implementation plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Colorado
for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10). The SIP was submitted
by the State on May 27, 1993 to satisfy certain federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate nonattainment
area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Lamar, Colorado.

 I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lamar, Colorado was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B)
and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act (Act) upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (See 56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991 and 40 CFR 81.306.) The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D of title I of the Act. The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble''
describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the
Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see
generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)). Because EPA is describing its interpretations
here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations
of title I advanced in this proposal and the supporting rationale. In this rulemaking action on the Colorado moderate
PM&hyph;10 SIP for the Lamar PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations taking
into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments
before taking final action on this proposal.

Those states containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things,
the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures
(RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption,
at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology_RACT) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993;
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10
by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also must submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which
become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to
achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR

II. This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In this action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of the Lamar plan revision which was due to EPA on November 15, 1991
and submitted by the State on May 27, 1993. EPA believes the attainment plan for Lamar meets all of the applicable requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP was not submitted by November 15, 1991 as required by section 189(a)(2)(A) of the Act,
EPA made a finding pursuant to section 179 of the Act that the State failed to submit the SIP and notified the Governor
in a letter dated December 16, 1991. See 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992). After the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP was submitted on May
27, 1993, EPA found the submittal to be complete pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act and notified the Governor
accordingly in a letter dated June 14, 1993. This completeness determination corrected the State's deficiency and,
therefore, terminated the 18-month sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act.

1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission.
However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA 6 months
after receipt of the submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After providing more than 30 days of prior public notice, the State of Colorado held a public hearing on April 15, 1993
to entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Lamar. The plan for Lamar was subsequently adopted by the
State and submitted by the Governor by letter dated May 27, 1993 as a proposed revision to the SIP. EPA received the submittal
on June 3, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the
completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittal was found to be complete, and a letter dated
June 14, 1993 was forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken
in the review process. In this action, EPA proposes to approve the State of Colorado's PM&hyph;10 SIP submittal for
Lamar relative to those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991 and invites public comment
on the action.

2. Accurate Emissions Inventory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emissions inventory
should also include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because
the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration
that the area cannot practicably attain), the emissions inventories must be received with the submission (see 57
FR 13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Colorado submitted a winter/spring season emissions inventory for the base year of 1992. A winter/spring
season emissions inventory was calculated because the highest PM&hyph; 10 concentrations generally occur in the
winter/spring season in Lamar. The base year inventory identified area sources as the primary cause of high PM&hyph;10
concentrations, which contributed 99 percent of the total emissions, with wind erosion from agriculture lands contributing
49 percent, re-entrained road dust from paved and unpaved roads contributing 24 percent, cattle feedlots contributing
15 percent, residential wood burning contributing 8 percent, and point sources contributing 1 percent. The remaining
3 percent of PM&hyph;10 emissions was due to emissions from tailpipes, agricultural tilling, and storage piles.
The emission inventory demonstrates that wind erosion from agricultural land is the principal contributor to PM&hyph;10
emissions in the Lamar nonattainment area. However, the State and EPA believe that during the conditions when the
PM&hyph;10 exceedances have been known to occur (high wind days preceded by warm, dry weather), PM&hyph;10 from wind
erosion may be coming into the area from land much farther away than the area modeled by the State in developing the Lamar
PM&hyph;10 emissions inventory. Thus, on the high wind days, agricultural emissions not in the immediate area surrounding
Lamar may represent a much greater contribution to total PM&hyph;10 emissions in the area. However, emissions from
such sources not in the immediate area surrounding Lamar were difficult to estimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is proposing to approve the emissions inventory because it generally appears to be accurate and comprehensive,
and provides a sufficient basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent
with the requirements of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.

3. RACM (Including RACT)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit provisions to assure that RACM (including
RACT) are implemented no later than December 10, 1993 (see sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C) of the Act). The General
Preamble contains a detailed discussion of EPA's interpretation of the RACM (including RACT) requirement (see 57
FR 13539&hyph;13545 and 13560&hyph;13561). In Lamar, wind erosion from agricultural farmland in the area was identified
as the principal contributor to the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment problem, and these emissions will be controlled through
reliance on the soil conservation measures of the Food Security Act (FSA). See e.g., 16 U.S.C. 3801, 3811&hyph;

The FSA, which was enacted in 1985, applies to any farmer participating in a federal farm subsidies program. One of
the main provisions of the FSA requires farmers who cultivate highly erodible land (which includes the majority of
the farmland surrounding Lamar) to develop and implement soil conservation plans. The conservation plan is to document
the decisions of an affected farmer with respect to location, land use, tillage systems, and conservation treatment
measures and schedules. The plan is to be based on the local Soil Conservation Service technical guide, and it is to
be approved by the local soil conservation district. See 16 U.S.C. 3812(a)(2). The law provides that if such a conservation
plan is actively applied by January 1, 1990 or 2 years after the Soil Conservation Service has completed a soil survey
for the farm, whichever is later, affected farmers shall have until January 1, 1995 to comply with the plan without
being subject to ineligibility for certain program loans, payments, and benefits.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the area surrounding Lamar, approximately 75&hyph;80 percent of the agricultural lands are subject to the soil
conservation requirements. According to the Southeast Regional Soil Conservation Service (SCS) office, all of
the farmers subject to the FSA in the Lamar area have developed conservation plans, and most of the farmers in the Lamar
area have already begun at least partial implementation of these plans.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The local SCS office has estimated that the implementation of these plans will result in a 70 percent reduction in wind
erosion emissions from the non-irrigated farmland surrounding Lamar (which represents 85 percent of the farmland
subject to the FSA in the Lamar area).

 While the State is relying on these provisions to reduce the PM&hyph;10 emissions from wind erosion in the Lamar area,
the State did not adopt these measures into the SIP or take credit for these control measures. Since these measures
are federally mandated and will be implemented by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it is not necessary for the State
to adopt these measures into the SIP. No credit was taken for these measures because of the difficulty in estimating
the effectiveness of these measures and, moreover, because no credit was needed to demonstrate attainment or maintenance
of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS in Lamar (see section II.A.4. of this document). Nevertheless, EPA does believe that the provisions
of the FSA will have a significant impact on the emissions from wind erosion from agricultural land in the Lamar area.
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RACT does not require controls on stationary sources in the Lamar nonattainment area because the point source emissions
in the Lamar area are de minimis, and control of such sources would not expedite attainment and maintenance of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS. See 57 FR 13540, 13543. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are also Statewide control measures that apply in the Lamar area. Colorado Regulation No. 4 requires new wood
stoves to meet the emission requirements of EPA's Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood Heaters in 40
CFR 60.532(b). Colorado Regulation No. 3 regulates the construction and modification of new stationary sources
of PM&hyph;10.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 These measures will help to reduce emissions from new stationary source growth and residential wood combustion.

The State is required by the amended Clean Air Act to adopt a revised new source review permit program for the construction
and operation of new and modified stationary sources. See Section 189(a)(1)(A). This SIP revision, which was submitted
by the State on January 15, 1993, was due independent of the November 15, 1991 moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area
SIP requirements addressed in this action and will be addressed in a separate notice. See section 189(a)(2)(A) of
the Act.

A more detailed discussion of the individual source contributions, the associated control measures, and an explanation
as to why certain available control measures were not adopted, can be found in the TSD. EPA has reviewed the State's
explanation and associated documentation and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be
implemented. The Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP demonstrates that the area will attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31,
1994. By this notice, EPA is proposing to approve Colorado's SIP submittal for Lamar as meeting the RACM (including
RACT) requirement. However, EPA is not proposing action on Regulations No. 3 and 4 because EPA has previously approved
these regulations in separate actions (see the TSD for further information).

4. Demonstration  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
As noted, the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality
modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December
31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). Alternatively, the State must show that attainment by December 31,
1994 is impracticable.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA regulations provide that the adequacy of a control strategy to provide for timely attainment must be demonstrated
by means of a proportional model or dispersion model or other procedure which is shown to be adequate and appropriate
(see 40 CFR 51.112(a)). EPA policy specifies that the preferred approach for estimating the air quality impacts of
emissions of PM&hyph;10 is to use receptor modeling in combination with dispersion modeling. However, on July 5,
1990, EPA issued guidance providing that, in certain situations, it may be more appropriate to rely on a receptor model
demonstration alone as the basis for the attainment demonstration (see July 5, 1990 memo to Regional Air Branch Chiefs
from Robert D. Bauman, Chief of SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/Particulate Matter Programs Branch and Joseph Tikvart, Chief of Source Receptor Analysis Branch). Lamar met the
criteria discussed in the July 5, 1990 memo to justify using receptor modeling alone and had originally planned to
use this approach in its attainment demonstration. However, after further review, the State determined that the
chemical mass balance (CMB) analysis (i.e., analysis of source contributions from PM&hyph;10 monitoring filters)
to be used in the receptor model was inadequate and decided to base the attainment and maintenance demonstration on
simple emissions rollback modeling, which involves using the ratio of the design day ambient concentration of 101
&mu;g/m3 to the design day emissions and projecting future concentrations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Lamar attainment and maintenance demonstrations did not follow EPA general guidance, the State included
a commitment in the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP to conduct revised CMB analyses on all filters greater than 100 &mu;g/m3 and
to use this information to assess the adequacy of the SIP. On September 20, 1993, the State submitted the revised CMB
analysis but did not utilize the results in calculating a revised attainment and maintenance demonstration. The
State determined that the receptor modeling performed for Lamar did not provide the conclusive source contribution
information that would be necessary in order to adequately revise the Lamar PM&hyph;10 attainment and maintenance
demonstrations. EPA has reviewed the State's analysis and concurs with the State's justification for using emissions
rollback modeling in its attainment demonstration. In addition, because the emissions rollback modeling demonstration
accounted for growth in source categories that were not even identified in the CMB analysis, EPA believes that the
use of emissions rollback modeling provides for a more conservative prediction of future concentrations. Thus,
EPA believes that the State's attainment demonstration adequately demonstrates that the Lamar PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area will remain in attainment and maintain the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. (See the TSD for further information.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 &mu;g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar
year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 &mu;g/m3 is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual
PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 50 &mu;g/m3, and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration
is less than or equal to 50 &mu;g/m3 (id.). The demonstration predicted that the 24-hour design concentration in the
attainment year of 1994 will be 115 &mu;g/m3, thus demonstrating attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS. The
demonstration also showed that the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS will be maintained in future years by predicting a 24-hour design
concentration in 1997 of 116 &mu;g/m3.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no violations of the annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS have been monitored in the Lamar area and since the attainment demonstration
in the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP clearly shows attainment and maintenance of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, it is reasonable
and adequate to assume that protection of the 24-hour standard will be sufficient to protect the annual standard as
well. For a more detailed description of the attainment demonstration, see the TSD accompanying this document.

5. PM&hyph;10 Precursors  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements which are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10
levels in excess of the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act).  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis of the air quality and emissions data for the Lamar nonattainment area indicates that the PM&hyph;10
exceedances in the Lamar area are generally attributable to particulate matter emissions from area sources, mainly
windblown emissions from agricultural lands, re-entrained road dust, cattle feed lots, and residential wood combustion.
In addition, the emissions inventory for this area did not reveal any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors.
Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major stationary sources of precursors of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute
significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. If finalized, this finding would exclude major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors from the applicability of PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements.
Further discussion of the analyses and supporting rationale for EPA's proposed finding are contained in the TSD accompanying
this document. Note that while EPA is making a general finding for this area, this finding is based on the current character
of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future
growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing
such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined
in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). RFP is defined in section
171(1) as such annual incremental reductions in emissions of the relevant air pollutant as are required by part D or
may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by
the applicable date.  
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In implementing the quantitative milestone and RFP provisions for this initial moderate area, EPA has reviewed the
attainment demonstration for the area to determine the nature of any milestones necessary to ensure timely attainment
and whether annual incremental reductions should be required in order to ensure attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS
by December 31, 1994 (see section 171(1)). Because the Lamar area can demonstrate expeditious attainment of the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS without taking credit for the reliance on the soil conservation plans, no further reductions are necessary.
Therefore, EPA believes the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP satisfies the quantitative milestone and RFP requirement. However,
there will be emissions reductions that occur as a result of the federally mandated soil conservation plans, which
will help to ensure that the area attains and maintains the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS.

7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in
a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,
et al. (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions must also contain a program that provides for enforcement
of the control measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above under section 3 entitled ``RACM (including
RACT).'' The State, while relying on the soil conservation measures of the FSA, has not adopted these measures into
the SIP or taken any credit for these measures. Since these measures are federally mandated and will be implemented
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they are considered to be federally enforceable. Thus, it is not necessary
for the State to adopt these measures into the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in section 3 above, there are State-wide regulations that will also impact the emissions of PM&hyph;10
in the Lamar nonattainment area. These regulations include Colorado Regulation No. 4, which requires all wood stoves
sold after July 1, 1991 to meet the emission requirements of EPA's Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood
Heaters in 40 CFR 60.532(b), and Colorado Regulation No. 3, which requires construction permits for new or modified
stationary sources. EPA previously reviewed Colorado Regulations No. 3 and 4 at the time these regulations were approved
by EPA as part of the SIP, and it was determined that these regulations met the enforceability criteria of the September
23, 1987 Potter Memorandum (see the TSD for information on EPA approvals of these regulations).

Note that the current version of Colorado Regulation No. 3 approved by EPA does not meet all of the applicable requirements
of the amended Act. As discussed in footnote number 4, the State submitted revisions to Regulation No. 3 in January
of 1993 which are being evaluated by EPA. EPA will act on that submittal in a separate notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Colorado has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the SIP are adequately enforced.
The Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD) has the authority to implement and enforce all emission limitations
and control measures adopted by the State, including the requirements of any emission control regulations, the SIP,
and any permit. The APCD has the authority to impose civil penalties of up to $15,000 per day per violation, as well as
criminal penalties. Thus, EPA believes the State has adequate enforcement capabilities to ensure compliance with
the Lamar PM&hyph;10 SIP and the State-wide regulations. The TSD contains further information on the State-wide
regulations, enforceability requirements, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective
implementation of the control measures.

8. Contingency Measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. These measures were
to be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Thus, the measures were due separate
from the requirements addressed in this notice. Contingency measures should consist of other available measures
that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without further action by the State
or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable
statutory deadline. The Lamar SIP submittal addressed in this notice did not include any contingency measures. The
State submitted the contingency measures for Lamar as a revision to the SIP on December 9, 1993. EPA will act on the December
1993 submittal in a separate notice.

III. Implications of This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to approve the plan revision submitted by Colorado for the Lamar nonattainment area on May 27,
1993 to satisfy those moderate area PM&hyph;10 SIP requirements due on November 15, 1991. Among other things, the
State of Colorado has adequately demonstrated that the Lamar moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will attain
the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are due at later dates.
The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA will
consider any comments received by May 6, 1994.

the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993.

VI. Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking advises the public that the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities
is considering an amendment to the regulations implementing the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act, as amended (the
``Act''). The proposed amendment would permit the indemnification of eligible items from the United States while
on exhibition in this country in connection with an exhibition of eligible items from outside of the United States.
The proposed amendment is not intended to bring about a major shift in emphasis of the current policy or practice of
the indemnity program. Specifically, exhibitions consisting solely of domestic items would continue to be ineligible
for indemnification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice invites comments that will assist the Federal Council in more fully understanding the issues involved
in such a change. The Federal Council particularly invites comments from groups, individuals, and other governmental
agencies involved in the international exhibition process, including museums, private insurers, and professional
and scholarly organizations. The revised rules will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1975, the United States Congress enacted the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act which established an indemnity program
administered by the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities (the ``Federal Council''). 20 U.S.C. section 273(c).
The Federal Council is composed of the heads of nineteen federal agencies and was established by Congress, among other
things, to coordinate the policies and operations of the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment
for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum Services, including the joint support of activities. 20 U.S.C. 972(a).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the indemnification program, the United States Government guarantees to pay loss or damage claims, subject
to certain limitations, arising out of exhibitions containing items determined by the Federal Council to be of educational,
cultural, historical or scientific value the exhibition of which must be certified by the Director of the United States
Information Agency as being in the national interest. In order to be eligible for indemnification, the objects must
be on exhibition in the United States, or if outside this country preferably as part of an exchange of exhibitions.

B. Regulatory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Council is the agency charged by Congress with the responsibility to administer the Arts and Artifacts
Indemnity Act. In practice, the Indemnity Program is administered for the Federal Council by the Museum Program of
the National Endowment for the Arts under the ``Indemnities Under the Arts and Artifacts Indemnity Act'' regulations
(the ``Regulations''), which are set forth at 45 CFR part 1160. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These Regulations have been promulgated, and amended from time to time, by the Federal Council pursuant to the express
and implied rulemaking authorities granted by Congress to make and amend rules needed for the effective administration
of the indemnity program. Among other things, Congress expressly granted the Federal Council the authorities to
establish the terms and conditions of indemnity agreements; to set application procedures; and to establish claim
adjustment procedures. 20 U.S.C. sections 971(a)(2), 973(a), 975(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a number of years, the Federal Council has considered the desirability of amending the Regulations to permit the
indemnification of U.S.-owned loans on exhibition in the United States in connection with certified international
exhibitions. As currently drafted, the Regulations do not cover domestic objects on loan to an international exhibition
in the United States. The Regulations provide, in pertinent part:

On February 25, 1993, during a lengthy discussion of the application of the National Gallery of Art for the indemnification
of the exhibition ``Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation: Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and
Early Modern,'' the Federal Council extensively considered the question of whether the eligibility criteria set
forth in the Regulations were more narrowly drawn than required under the Act. On a preliminary basis, the Federal
Council concluded that they were. While the Council approved the indemnification of the Barnes exhibition, a Certificate
of Indemnity ultimately did not issue because of legal uncertainities related to the Council's action under its current
Regulations. To clarify eligibility issues for future actions, the Federal Council also voted to ``move with dispatch
to amend its regulations.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 16, 1993, the Federal Council reaffirmed its vote of February 25, 1993 to amend the Regulations to permit the
coverage of domestic items in connection with international exhibitions in the United States. Specifically, the
Federal Council approved a motion to promulgate regulations revising 45 CFR part 1160.1 (``Purpose and Scope'')
by adding the following language immediately following section 1160.1(a)(2):

II. Statement of Views of the Federal Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1975, the Federal Council has approved indemnification for more than 500 exhibitions which have been viewed
by millions of Americans in towns, cities and college campuses across the nation. Indemnification has facilitated
both major international exhibitions and shows of more limited scale. More than 175 American museums have participated
in the program, saving the organizers of the exhibitions nearly $70 million in commercial premiums. To date, the costs
to the Federal government have been limited to the administrative costs of the program and the payment of two loss or
damage claims totalling $104,700.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Council believes that the proposed amendment to the Regulations will significantly enhance its ability
to provide the American public with the benefits of a high quality program of international exhibitions while not
significantly increasing the exposure of the Federal government to pay loss or damage claims nor significantly adding
to the administrative burdens or costs of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Council believes that widening the eligibility criteria under the Indemnity Program to include coverage
of U.S.-owned objects in exhibitions that also include foreign-owned loans would provide an important benefit to
U.S. cultural institutions and to the American public. Under the current guidelines, U.S.-owned loans may be indemnified
only when exhibited abroad. The Federal Council believes that if an exhibition of eligible items from abroad meets
the criteria of having educational, cultural, historical or scientific value, and is certified by the Director of
the United States Information Agency as being in the national interest, the U.S.-owned loans to the exhibition also
should be eligible for indemnification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Council wishes to stress that the proposed amendment is not intended to bring about a major shift in the
emphasis of the current policy or practice of the indemnity program. Under the proposed amended regulations, indemnity
coverage would continue to be available primarily for the exhibition of items coming from outside the United States.
It is anticipated that any U.S. loans to such international exhibitions would be a small but important component of
the exhibition. Exhibitions consisting solely of domestic items would continue to be ineligible for indemnification.
The Director of the United States Information Agency would continue to certify that the exhibition of items otherwise
determined by the Council to be eligible for indemnification is in the national interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Council believes that the proposed modification would not significantly increase the exposure of the
Federal government to claims for loss or damage while providing important additional relief for U.S. borrowing institutions.
This is because coverage during international transit, the time of greatest risk, would not be required for loans
from U.S. lending institutions. Nor does the Federal Council anticipate a significant increase in either the number
of applications to the program or the administrative burdens associated with applying or reviewing indemnification
applications. Under current practice, applicants already are required to include information on domestic loans
in their applications, and indemnity panels consider the educational, cultural, historical or scientific value
of both the domestic and foreign items in determining whether to indemnify an exhibition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ICC is proposing to establish a committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act to develop rules for electronic
tariff filing (ETF). The agency is inviting applications and nominations for the committee. The ICC has requested
approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to establish the committee. Although no difficulty in obtaining
approval is anticipated, no committee will be established until approval is obtained.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 After considering the comments filed in response to our last notice in this proceeding, we have decided to proceed
with the planning of a comprehensive ETF system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
., one that will support EDI and automated analyses). We believe that determining the scope and type of ETF system we
should adopt can best be achieved by initially specifying a comprehensive system in the context of an ongoing effort
to identify the needs that an ETF system should serve and the technologies (including EDI, tariff imaging, and others)
needed to meet them. There is currently no common understanding of what constitutes ETF. As ETF design progresses,
the choices among various benefit and cost packages will become clearer. This will help carriers and shippers to determine
what type of ETF system to support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with virtually all of the commenters supporting ETF that extensive industry participation is needed to resolve
the technical and policy issues involved in ETF. We believe the project can best move forward under procedures authorized
by the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990.

 The ``Reg-Neg'' Act establishes a framework by which Reg-Neg committees may resolve particular questions that would

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Reg-Neg approach seems well-suited to the development of ETF. Many ETF issues will be highly technical and complex.
A Negotiated Rulemaking Committee will allow a core of experts representing the affected interests to work together
on the issues on a continuing basis until consensus is reached. Moreover, a Reg-Neg Committee will be flexible; it
could, for example, choose to host one or more industry conferences to allow different groups to present proposals.
An agency may establish a negotiated rulemaking committee if the head of the agency determines that the use of the procedure
is in the public interest. Reg-Neg Act, section 583(a). In making this determination, the agency must consider whether:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) There is a need for the rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is a limited number of identifiable interests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) These interests can be adequately represented by persons willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is a reasonable likelihood that the committee will reach consensus within a fixed period of time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources to the process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The agency is committed to use the result of the negotiation in formulating a proposed rule if at all possible.

ETF Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As guidance to the Reg-Neg Committee, we will describe our current views on certain ETF issues and the characteristics
of a comprehensive system. We will also instruct the committee, however, not to limit its consideration to this type
of system. Rather, the Committee to identify the needs that an ETF system should serve, should review whatever alternative
technologies it believes may be preferable, and recommend appropriate rules to the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will specifically direct the Committee's attention to the electronic tariff imaging system currently being developed
by the Commission. The tariff imaging system provides for the retention of tariff page images on optical disks, rather
than retaining the printed tariff pages themselves. This system will provide much-improved security for tariff
documents, will greatly reduce the space required to store them, and will offer easier access to tariff information.
The imaging system can be enhanced to provide for the electronic transmission of tariff pages to the Commission, which
will allow carriers to file their tariffs ``electronically'' and avoid the time and expense of processing printed
documents. Therefore, unless EDI and automated analysis capabilities are required for tariff data, the tariff imaging
system (or some enhancement thereof) might offer a satisfactory and less expensive solution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our views on specific issues are as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We intend to begin with a unified proceeding, but to authorize the Committee to establish separate sub-groups (for
example, for rail and non-rail) at a later date if necessary.

 Some standardization across modes (using American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards, for example)
may be necessary to ensure that one EDI standard can accommodate all tariffs and that one ICC data base structure can
handle all tariffs. Ultimately, however, some data coding standards (commodity codes, etc.) may differ for rail
and motor carriers.

Carrier Sharing of the Commission's Custodial Responsibility for Official Tariff Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No commenter has described a shared system which assures protection of official tariff data. Under these circumstances,
we believe we must maintain custody of the data. The Commission will consider future shared custody arrangements
that do adequately ensure data integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Railroads' proposal to have carriers act as custodian of official tariff data is the most complete of those described,
but it does not contain enough information to permit an evaluation of the adequacy of data security. We have learned
from the undercharge crisis that strict security measures will be required to ensure that carriers cannot make unauthorized
changes to rates. Additionally, it's difficult to tell whether the data in Railroads' system is organized in ways
that would facilitate its use by shippers. It appears that Railroads, in response to an inquiry, can supply their determination
of ``the applicable rate''; however, prior tariff disputes have shown us that the carrier's determination is not
always accurate. Shippers need access to the array of published rates so they can make their own determination of the
correct rate. It is not clear whether or how Railroads' system would respond to such requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We reach no conclusion on this issue at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will request that the Reg-Neg Committee consider it and make a recommendation.

Other ETF System Design Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We anticipate that the recommendations from the Reg-Neg Committee will encompass ETF system design issues. Particularly
in light of the lack of detail in the comments, we agree with commenters that further consultations are required before
such decisions can be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Whether General Standards or Detailed Publishing Regulations Are More Appropriate for Printed Tariffs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will retain the status quo (general standards for rail tariffs and detailed regulations for other tariffs) while
ETF issues are being considered. The primary focus of this proceeding is on ETF; very few commenters address the printed
tariff issue; and we see no need to deal extensively with printed tariff issues at this time.

Characteristics of a Comprehensive ETF System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While we expect the Reg-Neg Committee to thoroughly consider design issues and recommend appropriate regulations
to the Commission, we offer the following comments on what might be appropriate for a comprehensive ETF system (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, one that will support EDI and automated analyses): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Rates would be filed in a data base-oriented format with defined, computer readable codes designating origins,
destinations, commodities, and other conditions of rate application (such as minimum weight, special packaging
requirements, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Although data coding standards should be required in a comprehensive system, additional analysis is necessary
to determine whether a common standard data coding structure should be required for all filers or whether different
standard structures should be adopted for rail, motor and/or water carriers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Although the publication of rules and accessorial charges in computer ratable formats is desirable, we do not believe
we should require that they be published in this manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Only raw ETF data should be made available from the Commission. Whether the Commission would develop software to
automatically analyze rates would depend on whether the Commission needs such software for agency operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The system should utilize ANSI EDI standards. We note FMC's contention that ANSI standards do not include all of
the fields required for tariff filing purposes, and hope that the ANSI standards can be expanded to meet such requirements
and enable us to avoid proprietary formats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We do not believe we should include a requirement that our ETF system be capable of determining the rates applicable
to particular movements. This determination does not, however, eliminate the need for data standards and standardized
EDI formats, since they will be required to enable shippers and carriers to automatically process ETF data.

Members of a committee are generally required to pay their own expenses of participating. Section 588 of the Reg-Neg
Act provides that the agency may pay for a member's reasonable travel and per diem expense, expenses to obtain technical
assistance, and a reasonable rate of compensation if the member certifies a lack of adequate resources to participate
in the committee and if the agency determines that such member's participation on the committee is necessary to assure
an adequate representation of the member's interest. The Commission does not anticipate paying any expenses under
this provision. The Commission will, however, provide administrative support and appoint an employee to represent
the agency on the Committee, and is investigating the hiring of a contractor to provide technical support.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1975, Congress enacted the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) because of a national concern with
the depletable nature and uncertain availability of most of the energy upon which the Nation relies for its economic
and social well being, and the need to implement a national program for conserving energy. Among other things, EPCA
added Title V, ``Improving Automotive Efficiency,'' to the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act (Cost
Savings Act). Title V provides for the establishment of corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passenger
cars and light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While Title V provides that the CAFE standard for passenger cars is 27.5 mpg for each model year after model year (MY)
1984 unless NHTSA amends it, the statute does not specify any particular level of light truck CAFE standards. Instead,
Title V requires the agency to set light truck CAFE standards for each model year, at least 18 months before the beginning
of the model year. In a final rule published elsewhere in today's edition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, NHTSA is establishing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996 and 1997 at 20.7 mpg. The final rule follows a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published by the agency in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 61377) on December 24, 1992. That NPRM did not address standards for model years after 1997. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the rulemaking for the MYs 1996&hyph;1997 light truck CAFE standards completed, NHTSA is turning its attention
to developing a proposal for light truck average fuel economy standards for model years after MY 1997. While the agency
has in the last decade set light truck CAFE standards for only one or two model years at a time, it believes that it may
be appropriate now to set standards for a much longer period, i.e., for some or all of the period including MYs 1998 to
2006. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the early 1980's, NHTSA has established light truck CAFE standards as little as 18 months and not more than 30
months before the beginning of the model year. The effect of this practice has been to limit the CAFE increases that
could be required because there was insufficient leadtime for the manufacturers to change their product plans and
improve their light truck fuel economy by means of significant technological improvements. In this period, the light
truck CAFE standard changed very little. For MY 1984, it was 20 mpg; for MY 1994, it is 20.5 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA explained the impact of such limited leadtime as follows in its December 1992 NPRM to establish the MYs 1995&hyph;97
light truck CAFE standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA recognizes that the leadtime necessary to implement significant improvements in engines, transmissions,
aerodynamics and rolling resistance is typically at least three years. Also, *&blank;*&blank;* once a new design
is established and tested as feasible for production, the leadtime necessary to design tools and test components
is typically 30 to 36 months. Some potential major changes may take even longer. Leadtimes for new vehicles are usually
at least three years. Further, light trucks have a long model life, i.e., 8&hyph;10 years or more. If a manufacturer
must make a major model change ahead of its normal schedule, this change may have a significant, unprogrammed impact.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the leadtime constraints, the agency does not believe that manufacturers can achieve significant improvements
in their projected CAFE levels for these model years by additional technological actions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
57 FR 61379, December 14, 1992. The agency notes that manufacturers commenting on the December 1992 NPRM argued that
the leadtimes discussed above are more typical for passenger cars and that light truck leadtimes are even longer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the upcoming light truck CAFE rulemaking is to be effective in encouraging manufacturers to improve their light
truck fuel economy by means of significant technological improvements, it must address model years for which the
manufacturers would have substantial leadtime. Thus, the rulemaking must address model years well beyond MY 1997,
the last model year for which a standard has been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several reasons why it appears necessary now for the agency to change the way it has been setting light truck
CAFE standards and to establish them high enough and far enough in advance to require significant fuel economy improvements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the need of the Nation to conserve energy is increasing. The import share of oil is growing, as is the percentage
from Arab OPEC sources. The United States imported 15 percent of its oil needs in 1955. The import share reached 36.8
percent in 1975, the year EPCA was passed, and peaked at 46.4 percent in 1977, at a cost of $91 billion (stated in 1992
dollars). Although the share declined to below 30 percent in the mid-1980's, lately the United States has again become
increasingly dependent on imported oil. In 1992, imports totaled 43.6 percent. The Department of Energy projects
that imports will rise to between 52 percent and 72 percent of total use in 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the United States now imports a higher percentage of its oil needs than it did during 1975, the year EPCA was passed.
Despite the establishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the late 1970s, concern still exists over the stability
of the oil import supply. The trend during the 1980s toward increasing diversity in sources of oil imports appears
to be reversing. In 1975, OPEC accounted for 61 percent of U.S. oil imports; by 1984, OPEC's share had dropped to 43 percent.
However, in 1992 OPEC accounted for 59 percent of U.S. oil imports. Moreover, the percentage of total U.S. oil consumption
supplied by Arab OPEC sources was 11.6 percent in 1992, higher than the 8.5 percent level for 1975. Oil continues to
account for over 40 percent of all energy used in the United States, and 97 percent of the energy consumed in the transportation
sector. Despite legislation such as the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and California's strict ``clean fuel'' and
emissions standards, fuels derived from petroleum will likely remain the predominant fuels in the transportation
sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Domestic oil production has declined steadily since reaching a peak of 10.6 million barrels per day in 1985. By 1992,
it had dropped to 9.0 million barrels per day. Domestic production is expected to continue declining by roughly 200,000
barrels per day each year through the year 2000. While the United States is currently the world's second largest oil
producer, it contains only about three percent of the world's known oil reserves. Persian Gulf countries contain
63 percent of known world reserves, and former Communist countries contain 9 percent. The Department of Energy projects
a continuing decline in domestic oil production to between 3.54 and 6.73 million barrels per day in 2010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second reason why NHTSA believes there may be a need now to change its approach to setting light truck CAFE standards
is the current lack of consumer demand or other market pressure for manufacturers to improve light truck fuel economy.
In the early 1980's, during the energy crisis brought on by events in Iran, gasoline prices rose rapidly. That rise
significantly increased consumer demand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. Thereafter, however, gasoline prices
fell sharply and have remained at very low levels for a decade. Consumers now place much greater emphasis on high performance,
and make little demand for improved light truck fuel economy. Performance levels are now higher than they were when
EPCA was enacted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of strong consumer demand or other market pressure for improved light truck fuel economy, there is no
reason to expect manufacturers to make significant technological improvements for the purpose of improving light
truck fuel economy, absent higher light truck CAFE standards or other government measures. Indeed, light truck CAFE
has not changed appreciably in the last six years and is not expected to do so in the next several years. The average light
truck fuel economy of the domestic manufacturers was 20.5 mpg in MY 1987, and 20.4 mpg in MY 1992, five model years later.
(The import manufacturers' average light truck CAFE, representing a relatively small market share, declined significantly
during this time, from slightly more than 25 mpg in MY 1987 to less than 23 mpg in MY 1992.) Moreover, as discussed in today's
final rule establishing the MY 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE standards, GM currently projects a MY 1997 CAFE of 20.5
mpg, Ford 21.6 mpg, and Chrysler 20.9 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third reason why effective light truck CAFE standards assume increased importance now is the continued growth in
market share of those vehicles. Light truck production increased from 1.9 million in MY 1980 to 4.1 million in MY 1992.
Data Resources, Inc., projects sales of 6 million light trucks in MY 1998 and close to 7 million by MY 2004. Light trucks
comprised nearly 33 percent of the total light vehicle production in MY 1992, almost double their share in MY 1980.
That share is expected to increase to 39 percent in MY 1998 and 42 percent by MY 2004. As light trucks increase in market
share, so does their impact on energy consumption and the importance of their potential contribution in addressing
the Nation's need to conserve energy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impact of the growing light truck population on energy conservation efforts can be more fully appreciated when
the CAFE of the total light truck fleet is compared with that of the total passenger car fleet. The light truck CAFE is
approximately 21 mpg, while the passenger car CAFE is approximately 28 mpg. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that there has been increasing concern in recent years about the impact of cars, light trucks and other
personal vehicles on global warming. There is an almost direct relationship between fuel consumption and emission
of carbon dioxide, a primary ``greenhouse'' gas. In other words, reducing fuel consumption also reduces carbon dioxide
emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the Administration's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993, the White House's National Economic
Council, the Office on Environmental Policy and the Office of Science and Technology Policy will co-chair a process
to develop measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. The efforts
of the task force may have a bearing on future light truck fuel economy standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also notes that the Administration is supporting research in improving vehicle fuel efficiency in a number
of areas, including the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. However, the purpose of this notice is a limited
one_requesting comments to assist NHTSA in developing a proposal for light truck CAFE average fuel economy standards
for model years after 1997, possibly through MY 2006. To aid the agency in obtaining useful comments, this notice discusses
a variety of issues which are considered by NHTSA in developing a CAFE standard proposal, and asks a number of questions
and makes a number of requests for data. For easy reference, the questions and requests are numbered consecutively
throughout the document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In providing a comment on a particular matter or in responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested
to provide any relevant factual information to support their conclusions or opinions, including but not limited
to test data, statistical and cost data, and the source of such information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the questions in the body of this notice, NHTSA is also including an appendix to this notice which consists
of a number of additional questions directed primarily toward light truck manufacturers. The appendix questions
address their product plans through MY 2006 and the assumptions underlying those plans. The agency recognizes that
the manufacturers' product plans may not be approved formally for even the earlier model years addressed in this notice
and that some of the questions may be difficult to answer. Setting standards well in advance instead of only one or two
years in advance necessitates reliance on less definitive information. However, that approach is necessary in order
for the agency to attain greater CAFE improvements. The agency would appreciate answers that are as responsive as
possible so that appropriate weight can be given to the many factors whose magnitude now can only be estimated. While
the questions in the appendix are directed toward manufacturers, the agency welcomes comments from all interested
persons in response to those questions.

II. The Statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 502(b) of the Cost Savings Act requires the Secretary of Transportation to issue light truck fuel economy
standards for each model year. The Act provides that the fuel economy standards must be set at the maximum feasible
average fuel economy level. In determining maximum feasible average fuel economy level, the Secretary is required
under section 502(e) of the Act to consider four factors: Technological feasibility; economic practicability;
the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy; and the need of the nation to conserve energy.
The Secretary is permitted but not required to set separate standards for different classes of light trucks. (Responsibility
for the automotive fuel economy program was delegated by the Secretary of Transportation to the Administrator of
NHTSA (41 FR 25015, June 22, 1976.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar terms in other statutes, the agency interprets ``feasible''
to refer to something that is capable of being done. Therefore, a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel
economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and (2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking
account of what manufacturers are able to do in light of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how
other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.

The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer
basis or on an industry-wide basis. As discussed in many fuel economy notices, it is clear from the legislative history
that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least capable manufacturer. Instead,
NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy
level. NHTSA has consistently set light truck standards at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles
constitute a substantial share of the market. Because of the relatively high volume of production by those manufacturers,
their capability bears a strong and close relationship to that of the industry as a whole.

III. Issues in Developing a Proposal for MY 1998&hyph;2006 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the significant issues involved in developing a proposal for the MY 1998&hyph;2006 light truck CAFE standards
is the ability of manufacturers to improve their light truck fuel economy during that period. In order to help it analyze
that issue, NHTSA requests information or comments on the questions which follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is interested in the technology that will be available for improving fuel economy. It is particularly interested
in technological advancements. For example, the development of two-cycle engines may have progressed to the point
that their introduction to the light truck fleet would be feasible some time in the MY 1998&hyph;2006 period. Another
example is the development of aluminum and nonmetal composites for automotive applications. These high performance
materials, which have become less expensive, are providing new opportunities for lightweight, high-performance
automotive components. The Miller cycle engine or other variations on the internal combustion engine may offer improvements
in fuel economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What is the technological feasibility and economic practicability of the various fuel efficiency enhancing technologies,
including, but not limited to each of the following, which were noted in the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) study
discussed below: Multi-valve and variable valve timing engines; electronic engine controls; port fuel injection;
lean burn-fast burn combustion; engine friction reduction; two-stroke engines; turbocharging; improved transmissions,
including continuously variable transmissions and electronic controls; redesigning vehicles for weight reduction
and aerodynamic enhancement; substitution of lighter-weight materials; lowering rolling resistance; low-friction
lubricants; and reducing parasitic losses, for improving manufacturers' CAFE for MY 1998&hyph;2006? In answering
this question, please address, for each of these technologies, as well as any other relevant technologies not yet
available: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The impact on fuel efficiency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Costs and benefits to the consumer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Manufacturer costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Leadtime; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Potential fleet penetration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What is the cost-effectiveness of each technology identified in Question 1, as well as any other relevant technologies,
assuming alternative plausible gasoline prices forecast for MY 1998&hyph;2006, and assuming alternative payback
periods ranging from 3 years to 10 years? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Taking into account the response to Question 1, indicate the ability of each manufacturer to improve its light truck
CAFE for each model year during the MY 1998&hyph;2006 timeframe. By what model year would maximum penetration of all
current fuel economy enhancing technologies be feasible? Why wouldn't such maximum penetration be feasible earlier
than that model year? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What analyses of manufacturer light truck fuel economy capabilities for MY 1998&hyph;2006 are available? What
are the strengths and weaknesses of each such analysis?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA notes that, in 1991, it joined with the Federal Highway Administration in commissioning the NAS to estimate
the practically achievable levels of fuel economy for various classes of passenger cars and light trucks. The NAS
report, Automotive Fuel Economy_How Far Should We Go?, was published in April 1992. NAS did not reach conclusions
on what the ``practically achievable'' levels of fuel economy were because it stated that it could not determine the
correct balance of the variables that would affect such an estimate. The variables include the ``technically achievable''
levels of fuel economy (described below), the economic effects in terms of jobs, higher vehicle prices, and competitiveness,
the effects on vehicle safety and petroleum consumption, etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAS report did venture to offer ``technically achievable'' predictions of fuel economy capabilities in MYs 2001
and 2006. The ``technically achievable'' values were based on certain assumptions. The assumptions were that only
currently existing technologies would be used, that fleets would meet the Tier I emissions standards of the Clean
Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, that vehicle interior volume and acceleration performance would be equivalent
to those of the MY 1990 fleet, and that the technologies used would be cost-effective at gasoline prices of $5&hyph;10
or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS offered two estimates for the light truck fleet for both MYs 2001 and 2006. One estimate was given with a high degree
of confidence that the light truck fleet could achieve such a level. The other estimate, for a higher CAFE level, was
given with a lower degree of confidence that the fleet could achieve that level due to unidentified uncertainties.
These values are as follows:

The figures in the table have several limitations. They do not represent the capability of any particular manufacturer.
Instead, they are intended to represent the light truck fleet as a whole. However, the fleet used by NAS did not include
all light trucks. The fleet included small pickups, small vans, small utility vehicles, and large pickups, but not
large vans and large utility vehicles. While those last two types of vehicles make up a small percentage of the light
truck market, they have low fuel economies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is particularly interested in receiving comments concerning the NAS report and whether, and how, it should
be used in rulemaking for the MY 1998&hyph;2006 light truck CAFE standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. has prepared a report for the Department of Energy that analyzes the domestic
manufacturers' light duty truck fuel economy potential to 2005. NHTSA is including it in the docket for this notice,
and would welcome comments on the relevance of the report to this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have mandated a number of safety and emissions standards for
light trucks that become effective in the next few years and that are likely to contribute to increased weight (and,
hence, decreased fuel economy) and increased cost of these vehicles. Among the safety requirements are the addition
of air bags (which phase-in through MY 1999), quasi-static side impact protection (by MY 1995), roof crush resistance
(by MY 1995), and interior head impact protection (with an effective date to be determined). The Clean Air Act Amendments
mandated a phase-in of more stringent emission standards for light trucks. The U.S. has agreed under the Montreal
Protocol to phase-out the chloroflourocarbons used in vehicle air conditioners. This will result in somewhat heavier
and less efficient air conditioners. Finally, EPA has also issued several final rules relating to test procedures
which could require calibration changes that reduce fuel economy and to onboard diagnostics which could add weight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. To what extent are other Federal standards likely to affect manufacturers' CAFE capabilities in MYs 1998&hyph;2006?
Answers to this question should include not only the effects of such standards when first implemented, but also the
prospect for reducing those effects subsequently.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
6. Assuming that NHTSA establishes a single light truck CAFE standard for each of MYs 1998&hyph;2006, what would be
the manufacturers' responses to CAFE standards set at alternative levels, and what would the energy savings be from
those levels? For example, what would be the effect of setting a CAFE standard at x^y mpg versus x mpg versus x+y mpg for
a given model year? NHTSA requests that, at a minimum, commenters answer the questions in this paragraph based on the
standard levels discussed in the NAS report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue that the agency must consider in setting light truck CAFE standards is the basic structure of the standards.
As indicated above, Title V provides the agency with discretion concerning whether to establish a single standard
for all light trucks or separate standards for different classes of light trucks. While NHTSA has in the past used its
authority to set separate standards for different classes of light trucks, most notably for two-wheel drive and four-wheel
drive light trucks, it has more recently established a single standard for all light trucks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A single standard has the advantage of maximizing manufacturer flexibility, e.g., enabling a manufacturer to decide
where in its light truck fleet to make fuel efficiency improvements. On the other hand, since the agency sets standards
at a level that can be achieved by manufacturers whose vehicles constitute a substantial share of the market, it is
possible that a single large manufacturer with a mix toward larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles could skew the single
standard downward for the entire industry. It might be possible to address this potential problem by establishing
separate standards for different classes of light trucks. The agency requests comments on the following question:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. For MYs 1998&hyph;2006, should NHTSA propose a single standard for all light trucks or separate standards for different
classes of light trucks? Should the answer to this question vary depending on the extent to which the CAFE capabilities
of manufacturers differ? If the agency should propose separate standards for different classes of light trucks,
how should the different classes be defined? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule issued today establishing light truck CAFE standards for MYs 1996&hyph;1997, NHTSA stated it believes
that CAFE standards for the last decade have not had any measurable effect on light truck weight or size; and, hence,
safety. In support of that belief, the agency noted that the levels of the light truck CAFE standards have not varied
significantly for more than a decade. The light truck CAFE standards for MY 1987&hyph;89 and MY 1994 were set at 20.5
mpg, and, as far back as MY 1984, the standard was only slightly lower at 20.0 mpg. NHTSA also noted that, in setting the
light truck CAFE standards over the last decade, the agency has not included in its analyses of manufacturer capabilities
any product plan actions that would significantly affect the weight, size or cost of the vehicles the manufacturers
planned to offer. Further, the average equivalent test weight of light trucks increased from 3,805 pounds in MY 1984
to 4,200 pounds in MY 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. NHTSA requests comments on the extent to which the increases in light truck CAFE feasible during MYs 1998&hyph;2006
involve means, such as significant weight or size reduction, that could adversely affect safety. Would achievement
during that period of NAS' estimated ``technically achievable'' levels necessarily depend on such means? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In setting CAFE standards, the agency takes into consideration that there are often technological risks associated
with actually achieving the full potential fuel economy improvement from a particular type of technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. How should the agency take technological risks into account in setting the light truck CAFE standards? What technological
risks are associated with gaining the full potential fuel economy improvements from any of the available types of
fuel economy enhancing technologies? What are the prospects for overcoming those risks or offsetting their effects
on CAFE capability?

This rulemaking was reviewed under E.O. 12866. The agency has considered the potential economic implications of
this rulemaking and determined that it is significant within the meaning of the Department's regulatory policies
and regulatory procedures. A preliminary regulation evaluation has been prepared for this notice and placed in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that it is likely that CAFE standards for MYs 1998&hyph;2006 will not have sufficient Federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This rule, when proposed, would not have any retroactive effect. Under section 509(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(a)),
whenever a Federal motor vehicle fuel economy standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or enforce any law or regulation
relating to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards applicable to vehicles covered by the Federal
standard. Under section 509(b) of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2009(b)), a state may not require fuel economy labels
on vehicles covered by section 506 of the Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2006) which are not identical to those required
by the Federal requirement. Section 509 does not apply to vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 504 of the
Cost Savings Act (15 U.S.C. 2004) sets forth a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending
or revoking Federal average fuel economy standards. That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration
or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The General Accounting Office (GAO) report dated October 30, 1991, entitled ``Economy and Efficiency Audits Can
Help Reduce Overhead Costs'', recommends that regulations be revised to provide guidance for the use of overhead
should-cost reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because contracts awarded to small entities normally are not subject to program or overhead should-cost reviews.
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small
businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
also be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C.
601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(FAR case 92&hyph;17), in correspondence.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

(a) Should-cost reviews are a specialized form of cost analysis. Should-cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation
methods. During traditional reviews, local contract audit and contract administration personnel primarily base
their evaluation of forecasted costs on an analysis of historical costs and trends. In contrast, should-cost reviews
do not assume that a contractor's historical costs reflect efficient and economical operation. Instead, these reviews
evaluate the economy and efficiency of the contractor's existing work force, methods, materials, facilities, operating
systems, and management. These reviews are accomplished by a multi-functional team of Government contracting,
contract administration, pricing, audit, and engineering representatives. The objective of should-cost reviews
is to promote both short and long-range improvements in the contractor's economy and efficiency in order to reduce
the cost of performance of Government contracts. In addition, by providing rationale for any recommendations and
quantifying their impact on cost, the Government will be better able to develop realistic objectives for negotiation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There are two types of should-cost reviews_program should-cost review (see 15.810&hyph;2) and overhead should-cost
review (see 15.810&hyph;3). An overhead should-cost review may be performed independently, or in conjunction with
a program should-cost review. The scope of a should-cost review can range from a large-scale review examining the
contractor's entire operation (including plant-wide overhead and selected major subcontractors) to a small-scale
tailored review examining specific portions of a contractor's operation.

Program should-cost review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Program should-cost review is used to evaluate significant elements of direct costs, such as material and labor,
and associated indirect costs, usually incurred in the production of major systems. When a program should-cost review
is conducted relative to a contractor proposal, a separate audit report on the proposal is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A program should-cost review should be considered, particularly in the case of a major system acquisition (see
part 34), when_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Some initial production has already taken place;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The contract will be awarded on a sole-source basis;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) There are future year production requirements for substantial quantities of like items;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The items being acquired have a history of increasing costs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective analysis and major changes are unlikely;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Sufficient time is available to plan and conduct the should-cost review adequately; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Personnel with the required skills are available or can be assigned for the duration of the should-cost review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The contracting officer should decide which elements of the contractor's operation have the greatest potential
for cost savings and assign the available personnel resources accordingly. While the particular elements to be analyzed
are a function of the contract work task, elements such as manufacturing, pricing and accounting, management and
organization, and subcontract and vendor management are normally reviewed in a should-cost review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In acquisitions for which a program should-cost review is conducted, a separate program should-cost review team
report, prepared in accordance with agency procedures, is required. Field pricing reports are required only to the
extent that they contribute to the combined team position. The contracting officer shall consider the findings and
recommendations contained in the program should-cost review team report when negotiating the contract price. After
completing the negotiation, the contracting officer shall provide the administrative contracting officer (ACO)
a report of any identified uneconomical or inefficient practices, together with a report of correction or disposition
agreements reached with the contractor. The contracting officer shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the
correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When a program should-cost review is planned, the contracting officer should state this fact in the acquisition
plan (see part 7, subpart 7.1) and in the solicitation.

Overhead should-cost review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An overhead should-cost review is used to evaluate indirect costs, such as fringe benefits, shipping and receiving,
facilities and equipment, depreciation, plant maintenance and security, taxes, and general and administrative
activities. It is normally used to evaluate and negotiate a forward pricing rate agreement (FPRA) with the contractor.
When an overhead should-cost review is conducted, a separate audit report is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The following factors should be considered when selecting contractor sites for overhead should-cost reviews:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Dollar amount of Government business;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Level of Government participation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Level of noncompetitive Government contracts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Volume of proposal activity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Major system or program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Mergers, acquisitions, takeovers; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Other conditions, e.g., changes in accounting systems, management, or business activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The objective of the overhead should-cost review is to evaluate significant indirect cost elements in-depth,
identify inefficient and uneconomical practices, and recommend corrective action. If it is conducted in conjunction
with a program should-cost review, a separate overhead should-cost review report is not required. However, the findings
and recommendations of the overhead should-cost team, or any separate overhead should-cost review report, shall
be provided to the ACO. The ACO should use this information to form the basis for the Government position in negotiating
a FPRA with the contractor. The ACO shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical
or inefficient practices.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The wording of the prescriptions at 15.804&hyph;8 (e) and (f) currently implies that the clauses at 52.215&hyph;27,
Termination of Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and 52.215&hyph;39, Reversion or Adjustment of Plans for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions, should also be used in solicitations and contracts with noncommercial organizations.
The clauses refer to the cost principles applicable to commercial organizations in FAR subpart 31.2, whereas OMB
Circulars A&hyph;21, A&hyph;87, and A&hyph;122 contain the cost principles governing contracts with noncommercial
organizations. In addition, the prescriptions currently contain dissimilar criteria concerning the use of the
clauses in preaward or postaward cost situations. The proposed revisions to the prescriptions at 15.804&hyph;8
(e) and (f) will correct these inconsistencies and clarify when the clauses at 52.215&hyph;27 and 52.215&hyph;39
should be used. Additional revisions to the clauses clarify the requirements specified in them.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost
principles do not apply. An analysis of data available for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 reveals that, in the Department
of Defense, the number of contract actions awarded to small businesses which required the submission of cost or pricing
data averaged less than 1 percent of the total number of small business actions during the three-year period. In addition,
for other than small business entities, any impact on such entities is considered to flow from the respective cost
principles contained in the governing OMB Circular (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, A&hyph;21, Cost Principles for Educational Institutions; A&hyph;87, Cost Principles for State and Local Governments;
and A&hyph;122, Cost Principles for Nonprofit Organizations). An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has,
therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amending
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to expand the circumstances when subcontracting plans may be required
and negotiated with more than the apparently successful offeror and to prescribe an Alternate II to the clause Small
Business and Small Disadvantaged Business Subcontracting Plan to be used when contracting by negotiation and subcontracting
plans are required with initial proposals. The intent of this proposal is to ensure that small and small disadvantaged
business concerns are being afforded the maximum practical subcontracting opportunities consistent with statutory
requirements and acquisition objectives. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget
review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because subcontracting plans are not required from small business concerns. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite

is submitting an individual contract plan, the plan must separately address subcontracting with small business
concerns and with small disadvantaged business concerns with a separate part for the basic contract and separate
parts for each option (if any). The plan shall be included in and made a part of the resultant contract. The subcontracting
plan shall be negotiated within the time specified by the Contracting Officer. Failure to submit and negotiate a subcontracting
plan shall make the offeror ineligible for award of a contract.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This case was opened based on Department of Defense Inspector General Report Number 92&hyph;090, May 14, 1992, Impact
of Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rates on Contract Prices, which found that regulatory guidance does not adequately
address consideration of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because this rule pertains to contracts entered into and performed overseas, and with rare exceptions, will affect
only foreign concerns. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments
from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 601. Such comments
must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.

(a) Unless a specific currency is required by international agreement or by the Trade Agreements Act (see 25.405(d)),
contracting officers shall determine whether solicitations for contracts to be entered into and performed outside
the United States will require submission of offers either in U.S. currency or in a specified foreign currency. In
unusual circumstances, the contracting officer may permit submission of offers in other than a specified currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To ensure a fair evaluation of offers, solicitations should generally require all offers to be priced in the same
currency. However, if submission of offers in other than a specified currency is permitted, the contracting officer
shall convert the offered prices to U.S. currency for evaluation purposes. The contracting officer shall use the
current market exchange rate from a commonly used commercially available source in effect on date of bid opening or
due date for receipt of final offers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If contracts are priced in foreign currency, agencies must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency
fluctuations in order to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAR language proposed for deletion at 28.311&hyph;1 applies only to cost-reimbursement contracts for research
and development awarded to state agencies or charitable institutions that claim partial or total immunity from tort
liability. For these entities, Alternates I and II of 52.228&hyph;7, Insurance_Liability to Third Persons, limit
the contract's insurance requirements and the Government's obligation to indemnify for third party liability.
The Councils believe that the current language is obsolete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the language proposed for deletion applies only to cost-reimbursement contracts for research and development
that are awarded to entities which, by virtue of their status as either an agency of the state or as a charitable institution,
claim partial or total immunity from tort liability under such contracts. These entities are believed to be few in
number. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities
concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments
must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FAR case 92&hyph;14), in correspondence.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the current FAR 31.205&hyph;41(b)(6), excise taxes on accumulated funding deficiencies or prohibited transactions
involving employee deferred compensation plans pursuant to sections 4971 and 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1954, as amended, are unallowable. This reflects a long-standing Government policy that punitive-type excise taxes
are not reimbursable costs on Government contracts. Over the years, subsequent legislation has added several new
excise taxes to subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code such that the Code currently lists 13 such
taxes. The Councils have agreed that it is appropriate to revise FAR 31.205&hyph;41(b)(6) to insert a general prohibition
on all excise taxes found at subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code. Such a general prohibition
will ensure that future legislative changes to subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue Service Code will be
automatically reflected in the cost principle.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because most contracts awarded to small entities are awarded on a competitive, fixed-price basis and the cost principles
do not apply. An analysis of data available for fiscal years 1989 through 1991 reveals that, in the Department of Defense,
the number of contract actions awarded to small businesses which required the submission of cost or pricing data averaged
less than 1 percent of the total number of small business actions during the three-year period. An Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing amendments
to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to increase certain dollar thresholds regarding Contractors' Purchasing
Systems Reviews (CPSR's) and Subcontractor Consent. These revisions are a result of recommendations submitted
in response to the FAR Council's request for industry's views on the FAR. This regulatory action was not subject to
Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We raised the threshold for performing CPSR's from $10 million to $25 million to recognize the effects of inflation
on this threshold which had not been changed since 1980. The $25 million threshold will reduce administrative burden
on both the Government and contractors by reducing the number of reviews performed annually and focuses the Government's
attention on large dollar procurement systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We raised the $10,000 threshold stated in the clause at 52.244&hyph;2(a)(4) to $25,000 for notification to the contracting
officer on proposed subcontracts involving fabrication, purchase, rental, installation, or other acquisition
of special test equipment or any items of facilities to recognize the increased costs of this type of equipment and
the effects of inflation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also raised the threshold in the clause at 52.244&hyph;2(b)(1) requiring additional information on certain subcontracts
from $10,000 to $25,000. This increase recognizes rising hourly wage rates and contract costs.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because the rule reduces burden on contractors by reducing surveillance and by increasing dollar thresholds at
which contractors are required to provide notification of intent to subcontract. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will
be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the proposed rule contains information
collection requirements. Accordingly, a request for approval of a new information collection requirement concerning
Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews and Subcontractor Consent is being submitted to the Office of Management
and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture, proposes to revise its regulations
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR Part 110, governing recordkeeping of federally restricted use pesticides by certified applicators. The regulations
governing recordkeeping of federally restricted use pesticides by certified applicators were published on April
9, 1993, and became effective on May 10, 1993. Since that time, issues have been raised regarding the regulations.
A lawsuit was filed challenging the substance of limited portions of the regulations. The changes specified in the
proposed rule would clarify certain provisions of the regulations, ensure consistency with the objectives of section
1491 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, and provide for a more pragmatic approach to the
implementation of the Pesticide Recordkeeping Program.

). This proposed rule will (1) clarify certain definitions within the regulations; (2) clarify the availability
of pesticide record information to facilitate medical treatment or first aid; (3) clarify the utilization and release
of pesticide record information by licensed health care professionals; (4) modify the time period by which the information
required by the regulations shall be officially recorded, and (5) ensure uniformity in recording the location of
pesticide applications by removing the distinction between recording spot applications and other applications
of federally restricted use pesticides. We do not anticipate that any of these proposed changes will result in any
significant additional economic impact on certified (private and commercial) applicators of federally restricted
use pesticides.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub.L. 101&hyph;624; 7 U.S.C. 136i-1), hereinafter
referred to as the FACT Act, Congress mandated the establishment, by the Secretary of Agriculture in consultation
with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, of requirements for recordkeeping by all certified
applicators of federally restricted use pesticides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicator certification programs are administered by EPA, other Federal Agencies, and States. A restricted use
pesticide, as distinguished from a general use pesticide, is one that has been classified as such under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA, at 7 U.S.C. 136a(d)(1)(C)). EPA regulations issued under FIFRA,
further provide that restricted use pesticides may be applied only by, or under the supervision of, a certified applicator.
Applicator certification requirements are provided in the EPA regulations (40 CFR 171). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A certified applicator may be a commercial applicator or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private applicator. A private applicator is one who uses or supervises the use of any restricted use pesticide for
purposes of producing any agricultural commodity: (1) On property that is owned or rented by the applicator, or the
employer of the applicator; or (2) if applied without compensation other than trading of personal services between
producers of agricultural commodities, on the property of another person. A commercial applicator is one who uses
or supervises the use of a restricted use pesticide for any purpose or on any property other than as provided under the
definition of a private applicator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 9, 1993, final regulations were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``Recordkeeping Requirements for Certified Applicators of Federally Restricted Use Pesticides.'' These regulations
went into affect on May 10, 1993. USDA proceeded to implement a national program for recordkeeping of federally restricted
use pesticides. One of USDA's first goals was to inform certified pesticide applicators of their responsibilities
under the new regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early in the implementation phase of the USDA recordkeeping program, State regulatory agencies and others raised
issues involving specific interpretations of the regulations. A lawsuit was filed against the Secretary of Agriculture
and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency by the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides
and others. The lawsuit challenged the substance of limited portions of the final regulations promulgated by USDA.
After careful consideration of the issues raised by the lawsuit and a thorough review of the regulations, we agreed
to propose changes to the regulations for the reasons set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendments to &sect;110.2 Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concerns were raised that the regulation's definition of ``medical emergency'' was too restrictive and could hinder
the medical treatment by licensed health care professionals of an individual(s) who may have been exposed to a federally
restricted use pesticide. It was pointed out that some particular pesticide exposures could require immediate medical
treatment or first aid, but would not meet the criteria of the current definition. It is not the intent of USDA to limit
medical treatment of an individual(s) who may have been exposed to a restricted use pesticide. Because reactions
to some pesticide exposures could require treatment immediately and not fit the current definition of ``medical
emergency,'' USDA is proposing to amend the definition of ``medical emergency'' to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Medical Emergency. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A medical emergency shall be defined as a situation that requires immediate medical treatment or first aid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions also were raised concerning the definition of ``licensed health care professional.'' There was some confusion
as to whether medically trained individuals who had been certified by a State, such as medical technicians on an ambulance
or emergency response vehicle, met the definition. USDA wishes to clarify that individuals that have been licensed
or certified by a State to provide medical treatment are considered to be ``licensed health care professionals.''
Therefore, individuals such as physicians, nurses, physician assistants, or emergency medical technicians, licensed
or certified by a State to provide medical treatment, would fall into the definition of ``licensed health care professionals.''
However, individuals who have been certified only to provide first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through
organizations such as the American Red Cross would not be ``licensed health care professionals.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to clarify this definition, USDA is proposing to amend the definition of ``licensed health care professional''
to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Licensed health care professional. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

A physician, nurse, emergency medical technician, or other qualified individual, licensed or certified by a State
to provide medical treatment.

Proposed Amendment to &sect;110.3(a)(6)_Spot Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reduced requirements for recording information for spot applications were intended to provide private certified
applicators with an incentive to record small spot applications on noxious weeds or similar type applications, without
recording each location, due to the usually small amount of pesticide associated with a spot treatment. Concerns
were raised that the spot application record provision does not require a specific location for each spot application,
which could be important information for the purpose of providing first aid or medical treatment. USDA has reviewed
the spot application provision and agrees that, in some instances, the location of spot applications could be valuable
information when needed to determine if a pesticide exposure could have occurred in a field or area. Therefore, we
are proposing to delete &sect;110.3(a)(6). Under the proposed regulations, spot applications would be required
to be recorded in the same manner as are other applications of federally restricted use pesticides. This would provide
field or area locations which could be utilized to help determine if an individual could have been exposed to a federally
restricted use pesticide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendment to &sect;110.3(b)_Time for Making an Official Record
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USDA has reevaluated the 30 day time period allowed certified applicators to make an official record after concerns
were expressed regarding the accuracy of the records for both collecting information for a pesticide use data base
and for medical treatment if application information was not required to be recorded for 30 days. USDA recognizes
the importance of compiling accurate pesticide use data and believes that data recorded in a shorter time period would
be more accurate. USDA also reexamined existing State requirements for making official records of pesticide applications
for private and commercial certified applicators. We found that many State regulations require applicators to have
records available ``upon request'' which, in some situations, could be interpreted to be immediately after an application.
Therefore, to assure more accurate information for both medical treatment and accuracy of collected data on pesticide
use, USDA proposes to change the time period from 30 days to 7 days. USDA considers the proposed 7 day requirement adequate
to allow the private certified applicator time to make an accurate official record without causing an undue hardship
in peak production periods. This proposed requirement also is less stringent than similar existing State requirements
for recordkeeping in many States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, concerns were raised regarding the certified applicator's responsibility to provide federally
restricted use pesticide information concerning a specific application prior to the time to make an official record
for purposes of providing medical treatment. USDA interprets the current regulations to require certified applicators
to provide the record information for purposes of providing medical treatment or first aid, in accordance with the
provisions of &sect;110.5(a), whether or not the time to make an official written record has elapsed. Nonetheless,
in order to make this clear, we propose to add explicit language to this effect. The proposed amendment would read as
follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The information required in this section shall be recorded within seven (7) days following the pesticide application.
However, whether or not the written record has been completed, the certified applicator shall provide the information
to be recorded in accordance with the provisions of &sect;110.5(a) of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendments to &sect;110.5(a)_Availability of Records to Facilitate Medical Treatment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions also have been raised concerning the availability of records to facilitate medical treatment. Concern
was expressed that the current regulations could hinder access to record information if a strict interpretation
was applied to the need for the licensed health care professional to personally make the record information request.
USDA never intended to prevent an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health care professional
from requesting record information. We are aware that, in some instances, the attending licensed health care professional
may rely on a person acting under his/her direction to make the contacts necessary to obtain the pesticide record information.
However, the regulations also presume the request for pesticide record information is supported by indications
of pesticide exposure and the need for medical treatment or first aid. For example, the attending licensed health
care professional, such as a registered nurse, may determine that the pesticide record information will be necessary
to treat the patient, and instruct someone under his/her direction, to obtain the record information.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to clarify the availability of pesticide record information to facilitate medical treatment, USDA proposes
to amend &sect;110.5(a) to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When a licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health
care professional, determines that any record of the application of restricted use pesticide required to be maintained
under &sect;110.3 of this part is necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual who may have
been exposed to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is or will be maintained, the certified applicator
required to maintain the record shall promptly provide the record information and any available label information.
If it is determined by a licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending
licensed health care professional, to be a medical emergency, the record information of the restricted use pesticide,
relating to the medical emergency, shall be provided immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendments to &sect;110.5(b)_Release of Record Information by licensed Health Care Professionals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current regulations, licensed health care professionals may release record information obtained through
&sect;110.5(a) only when necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual who may have been exposed
to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is maintained. Concerns were raised that some confusion could
exist among licensed health care professionals as to the extent to which they could share or utilize pesticide record
information. Concerns were expressed that licensed health care professionals, or an individual acting under the
direction of the attending licensed health care professional, could be reluctant to release pesticide record information
to other medical professionals, who may need to be consulted, to provide proper medical treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues also were raised concerning the release of the record information as it relates to pesticide poisoning incident
reports, and the need to assure licensed health care professionals that they could release pesticide record information
for this purpose. Some States require pesticide poisoning incident reporting to a designated State or county agency.
For example, California has a law that requires physicians to submit a pesticide poisoning incident report to the
California Worker Health and Safety Division. Additionally, in States which do not require the filing of a pesticide
poisoning incident report, physicians or other medical professionals are encouraged to report incidents to the
local poison control centers. These local poison control centers then may send data to the Toxic Exposure Surveillance
System of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) database, which provides an annual compilation
of poisoning statistics from around the United States. USDA believes the release of pesticide record information
for this purpose is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA also recognizes that a licensed health care professional may deem it necessary under their responsibility to
a code of medical ethics to utilize pesticide record information to prevent additional poisoning or injuries. For
example, as a result of treating an individual who had been exposed to a federally restricted use pesticide, the licensed
health care professional may feel it necessary to release the record information to the proper State or county authorities
in order to remove workers from an area where pesticide exposure could be occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in order to clarify the circumstances under which the federally restricted use pesticide information
can be utilized and released, and who has authority to release this information, USDA proposes to amend &sect;110.5(b)
to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A licensed health care professional, or an individual acting under the direction of the attending licensed health
care professional, may utilize and release record or record information obtained under paragraph (a) of this section
when necessary to provide medical treatment or first aid to an individual or individuals who may have been exposed
to the restricted use pesticide for which the record is or will be maintained. Further utilization and release of such
record or record information is limited to licensed health care professionals who may use it: (1) To submit pesticide
poisoning incident reports to appropriate State or Federal agencies, or (2) where consideration of medical ethics
may necessitate such utilization and release.

Proposed Amendments to &sect;110.7_Penalties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several State pesticide regulatory agencies had questions in regard to the penalty provision in &sect;110.7 of the
current regulations. These agencies interpreted this section to provide that the Administrator, or his designee,
would have discretion to reduce the penalty for a second violation of the regulations to less than $1,000 if it was determined
that the certified applicator made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations, but, that the Administrator,
or his designee, would not have discretion to reduce the penalty to less than $1,000 for other subsequent offenses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA has reexamined this issue and agrees that the current language could be unclear. We, therefore, propose to amend
the penalty section to eliminate any ambiguity. We are proposing that all offenses subsequent to the first offense
would be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000, except that the penalty shall be less than $1,000 if the Administrator,
or his designee, determines that the certified applicator made a good faith effort to comply with the regulations.
This proposed change follows the language of the statute and provides the Administrator, or his designee, flexibility
in assessing penalties for all subsequent offenses, not just the second offense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, USDA proposes to amend &sect;110.7 to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

of 1990. Therefore, as provided in section 1491(d) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990,
any certified applicator who violates the requirements of 7 U.S.C. 136i&hyph;1 (a), (b), or (c) shall be subject to
a civil penalty of not more than $500 in the case of the first offense, and in the case of subsequent offenses, be subject
to a fine of not less than $1,000 for each violation, except that the penalty shall be less than $1,000 if the Administrator,
or his designee, determines that the certified applicator made a good faith effort to comply with this Part.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA) directed the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) to make
program changes as necessary to improve actuarial soundness of the Federal crop insurance program and to achieve,
by the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1995, a projected overall loss ratio not to exceed 1.10 (110 percent) (section
1501(a)). Section 1501(c)(2) further directed the Department to issue for public comment a comprehensive plan or
``blueprint'' that identifies, among other things:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Steps FCIC intends to take to achieve a projected overall loss ratio of no greater than 1.10 on and after October
1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Additional steps if further action is required, based upon actual program experience or unforeseen external
circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Modifications to be considered if initial actions to improve actuarial soundness work better than anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Projections, assumptions, and analyses which underlie the FCIC conclusions that the above actions will achieve
the required loss ratio within the stated deadline while maintaining fairness and effective coverage to agricultural
producers, and which thereby demonstrate FCIC's compliance with the performance standard identified in section
1501(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following notice outlines such a plan. Readers are requested to identify additional issues other than those outlined
herein that they believe are relevant and important in assisting FCIC in its actions to manage the program to achieve
the target loss ratio. This notice encourages comment and participation from the affected public. Comments and inquiries
should be sent to the address listed below.

Actions identified herein result from internal analysis by FCIC and information previously provided to FCIC by numerous
interested parties. These include the Commission for the Improvement of Crop Insurance (a Congressionally established
work group in 1989 and 1990), various crop insurance industry organizations, members of Congress, agricultural
producers, crop insurance agents and insurance companies, the General Accounting Office, and others. Information
was not solicited specifically for this draft but was compiled from previous recommendations. Not all of the specific
recommendations made by any or all of these groups are included herein. This document establishes initiatives to
achieve the above actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimates of the financial impact of an action, based on available data and professional judgment, are provided whenever
possible. Readers should recognize that these estimates are fluid due to the nature of the data and the ever-changing
program. In particular, since FCIC does not have a single aggregate mathematical or statistical model that describes
its programs, estimates of financial impact are based on partial analysis which considers the effect of one particular
action in the absence of any other action or initiative. Also, the exact steps to be taken under this Blueprint depend
in part upon the public comment and recommendations received before investing resources in detailed studies of potential
impacts. Readers are encouraged to provide information, rationale, and where possible, estimates of costs or potential
savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases the financial impact of an action may not be quantified. This does not mean the action is not important
or that it cannot contribute to achievement of the goal. For example, enhanced management reporting systems do not
produce a measurable financial impact. However, such systems can enhance FCIC's ability to estimate the potential
impacts of program changes and assure that ongoing management decisions recognize the impact of the decision on future
actions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Crop insurance is delivered primarily by commercial insurance companies that have entered into a cooperative financial
arrangement [the Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA)] with FCIC. Under this arrangement, the company agrees to
deliver an FCIC designed and priced product to eligible buyers. The company is responsible for all aspects of customer
service, and guarantees payment of the insured person's share of the premium to FCIC. In return, FCIC reimburses the
company for administrative expenses and requires the company (on a state basis) to share in insurance experience
whether favorable or unfavorable. FCIC also provides stop loss reinsurance that limits the maximum loss the company
can sustain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A small and decreasing portion of the total sales is managed directly by FCIC through sales and service contractors.
These contractors agree to sell an FCIC designed and priced product and to perform certain servicing functions related
to the sale (such as determining the average yields). FCIC reimburses the contractor for administrative expenses
associated with selling and servicing the product; however, FCIC is directly responsible for premium collection,
loss adjustment, and payment of losses. These latter functions are the responsibility of the reinsured company under
that delivery system. FCIC intends to eliminate direct sales after the 1994 crop year because this system now delivers
less than 10 percent of the total business, and maintaining a nationwide capability for delivery at an acceptable
cost is difficult.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The crop insurance plan for most crops indemnifies insured persons for losses in yield exceeding a predetermined
threshold amount. To establish this threshold an average yield is determined based on the individual's production
history. The first portion of the loss (deductible of the insurance), equal to 25, 35, 50, or 65 percent of the average
yield, must be sustained by the insured person. These are the choices of deductibles now offered by FCIC, and typically
are described by the maximum loss in yield covered by the insurance; e.g., 75 percent coverage, 65 percent, etc. The
50 and 75 percent coverage levels are required by the Act to be available to all persons. The level of coverage is chosen
by the insured individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The insured person also must choose a price at which the yield is valued for the purposes of computing the amount of premium
and any applicable amount of loss; this variable is called the price election. FCIC must offer a price election that
is not less than the anticipated market price at time of harvest. This determination is made well before the possibility
of loss is known during the crop year. Otherwise, insured persons would choose low price elections if no loss is sustained
(minimizes premium payments) the highest possible price election if a loss occurs (maximizes indemnities).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC establishes premium rates for the various coverage levels, yields, crop types and farming practices (e.g.,
irrigated) for each county. All planted acres of the crop are covered by the insurance policy unless for some reason
the acreage is uninsurable. The premium owed by the insured person is determined by multiplying the average yield
per acre by the coverage level, multiplied by the number of acres planted, the price election, and the premium rate.
For example, if the average yield is 100 bushels per acre, the coverage level is 65 percent, planted acres are 50, the
price election is $2.25, and the premium rate is 5.2 percent, the premium is equal to 100 &times; 0.65 &times; 50 &times;
$2.25 &times; 0.052, or $380.25. The potential indemnity in the event of a total loss is $7,312.50 (determined by multiplying
the average yield, coverage level, planted acres, and price election). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A portion of the total premium is subsidized to encourage participation in the program. The subsidy is 30 percent of
the total premium for coverage levels up to and including the 65 percent level. The subsidy for 75 percent level of coverage
is equal to the dollar amount that would be paid at the 65 percent level of coverage. The premium subsidy for the above
example would be $114.08; thus, the insured person would pay $266.17. The same $114.08 subsidy would be paid if the
insured person chose the 75 percent coverage level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of a loss, the amount of production that was harvested, or that was determined should have been harvested,
is measured by the insurer. An indemnity payment is made if the determined production is less than the total guarantee
for the acreage (yield multiplied by coverage level and acres planted). For example, if the insured person harvests
1,000 bushels from 25 acres and does not harvest a potential yield of 10 bushels per acre from the remaining 25 acres,
the total of the production to count is 1,250 bushels (1,000 bushels harvested plus 25 acres multiplied by 10 bushels).
This is subtracted from the total bushel guarantee for the acreage (100 &times; 0.65 &times; 50, or 3,250 bushels),
resulting in a loss of 2,000 bushels. The indemnity is equal to the number of lost bushels multiplied by the price election.
For this example, the indemnity would be 2,000 bushels &times; $2.25, or $4,500.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crop insurance does not guarantee revenue. As the above example illustrates, it provides an insurance indemnity
only if production is less than the established guarantee. No protection is provided if the market price is less than
the price election.

B. Legislative Background and Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal crop insurance was established as a pilot program in the 1930's. Prior to 1980, crop insurance was available
only on major crops in major producing areas. The coverage level often was limited to 60 percent or less of a long-term
average yield for an area. Congress amended the Act in 1980 to expand the scope and coverage of the program with the intent
that it be the sole means of providing public disaster assistance to U.S. farmers. Participation in the program increased
after the 1980 amendments, but remains below levels deemed necessary to be regarded as the principal vehicle for disaster
assistance. Insured acreage peaked at about 40&hyph;45 percent of the total acreage planted to insurable crops in
1988&hyph;89, but more commonly has been in the 30&hyph;35 percent range. Losses also increased with the expansion
of the program. The loss ratio has exceeded the break-even amount of 1.00 in every year since 1980. Cumulative losses
for the years 1980&hyph;1992 were approximately $2.9 billion, with a cumulative loss ratio of about 1.45 for the 13
years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program participation is an issue influencing the Federal crop insurance program. Full participation (i.e., 100
percent of eligible acres insured) is the measure of program success that is accepted (at least implicitly) by some
persons. This measure may not be the most appropriate. A rational decision to buy insurance of any kind must be based
on the magnitude of the financial difficulties that accompany a loss. For example, buying collision coverage on a
15-year old automobile makes little financial sense. Similarly, buying insurance on a crop that contributes only
a small portion of the expected income of the insured person may not make financial sense. Full participation in the
crop insurance program may not represent an efficient use of the taxpayer's resources. However, participation must
be high enough to minimize or eliminate perceived needs to legislate disaster assistance funded under dire emergency
provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act. The level of participation in the crop insurance program that maximizes
returns to the public is not known, and is an area needing further definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many losses paid in the 1980's and early 1990's were due to widespread disasters, the adverse financial effects of
which Congress intended to mitigate under the Act. However, continuing loss ratios exceeding 100 percent, enactment
of disaster assistance in nearly every year since 1988, and lower than desirable participation indicate that the
public policy goals of the program have not been fully realized. The Secretary of Agriculture has proposed a reform
of the crop insurance program to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposals contained in this Blueprint focus on these three areas that directly relate to the goal of achieving
the targeted loss ratio. They are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Actuarial matters such as premium rates and yield guarantees,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Underwriting matters such as terms and conditions of insurance policies, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Management issues such as compliance and risk-sharing arrangements with commercial insurers.

II. Management Actions To Achieve a Loss Ratio of 1.10
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Develop More Accurate Insurance Yields
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The insurance yield may be the single most important factor in determining the success or failure of the crop insurance
program. A yield that is too high compared to the productive potential of the person or land will increase the number
of years that a loss is paid. An excessively high yield also increases the amount paid when a loss occurs. A yield that
is too low will not effectively protect farmers from loss and, because it is regarded as insufficient, will not induce
desired levels of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the 1985 through 1993 crop years, insured yields were based on a program called the Actual Production History
(APH) Plan. The goal of this program was to obtain 10 previous yields to establish the insured yield for the next crop
year. Proxy yields largely based on ASCS farm program payment yields or county averages were allowed whenever farmers
would not or could not provide 10 years of history. Analysis by FCIC and others determined the proxy yields were benefiting
farmers whose yields tended to be lower than average and discouraging farmers whose yields tended to be above average.
Consequently, a modified-APH program that reduced the influence of the proxy yields was introduced beginning with
the 1994 crop year; thus, a ``ladder'' was introduced into the proxy yields. Only 65 percent credit is given to the proxy
yield if no actual yields are reported, 80 percent credit is given if one actual yield is reported, 90 percent if two
actual yields are reported, and 100 percent if three actual yields are reported. The proxy yields are not used after
four actual yields are available. The insured yield is a simple average of the 4 years of actual and modified proxy yields
for the first 4 years, and then (after 4 years) is the simple average of the actual yields reported. Acquiring 10 years
of production history remains the goal of the program. These revised procedures are the core of the initiatives to
comply with the mandate of OBRA 93 to institute rules to demonstrate actual production histories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised rules are expected to substantially reduce losses of the Federal crop insurance program. Analysis performed
by FCIC indicates the new rules would reduce losses by 15 percent for corn, 22 percent for soybeans, and 18 percent for
wheat. These analyses were based on simulations of loss histories using the rules for the two computational methods_the
previous APH and the proposed modified-APH plans. The analyses encompassed nine states each for corn and soybeans
and three states for wheat. These states and crops represented nearly 60 percent of the total premiums earned in 1990.
The results indicated that the modified-APH rules would reduce losses by a weighted average of 19 percent and are believed
to be representative for most crops.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The actual loss ratio for the 1990 crop year was 1.23. If the modified-APH rules did reduce losses by an average of 19
percent, the loss ratio would have been 0.996. This would achieve significant compliance with the loss ratio target
of 1.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these results, FCIC implemented modified-APH for the 1994 crop year by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promulgating regulations for the program during calendar year 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Measuring the impact of the modifications upon net program losses by calculating insured yields, premiums,
and indemnities of policyholders under 1993 and 1994 rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Where possible, determining whether the modified-APH rules had the intended effect of providing a more accurate
offer for farmers who previously elected not to purchase crop insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Determining whether the average number of yields reported for prior years has changed under the modified-APH
rules compared with APH rules for 1990 through 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Implementing a tracking system to assure that insurance experience remains associated with a person in future
years (see item D below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Developing reporting processes to assure that the accuracy of yield determinations is continuously monitored
and improved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Actions requiring analysis of the effects of the modified-APH rules upon the accuracy of insured yields cannot
be completed until losses from the 1994 crop year are processed. For wheat and other fall planted crops, such availability
will occur by about the fourth calendar quarter of 1994. For spring planted crops, this does not occur until about the
middle of the first calendar quarter of 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC believes that these actions to implement modified-APH will reduce the average loss ratio over time by 10&hyph;15
percentage points (e.g., from an average of 1.40 for several years to 1.25 to 1.30). This estimate is based on a conservative
expectation of the actual results of the simulations described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Catastrophic Yield Adjustment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC recognizes that the average of a series of observations as short as 4 years is subject to significant variations
due to abnormally large or small yields during that time. For example, if a major disaster year such as 1993 is included
in the 4 years, the procedure implicitly states that a similar year will occur once every 4 years. This is not likely.
Thus, FCIC will examine certain adjustments to the modified-APH rules with a goal to assign more appropriate probabilities
to the individual observations. These adjustments commonly are called catastrophic yield adjustments. However,
just as the yields for 1 year may be abnormally low, they also may be abnormally high. Capping the abnormally high years
may also be appropriate so that average yields are not excessively high due solely to a few observations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC will evaluate alternative methods to recognize catastrophic and unusually good crop years, and consider implementing
appropriate adjustments to the modified-APH plan effective for the 1995 crop year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Implement Group Risk Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC is implementing a program of insurance that is based on the average yield of an area, not upon individual yield
coverage as is offered under the traditional APH program. The area coverage is called the Group Risk Plan (GRP) by FCIC.
GRP was introduced as a pilot program for the 1993 crop year for soybeans in 96 counties. It was expanded for the 1994
crop year to include seven additional crops encompassing, 1,872 county crop programs (one crop in one county) in 27
states. Crops now included under GRP are barley (three states), corn (17 states), cotton (seven states), forage (two
states), grain sorghum (four states), peanuts (four states), soybeans (24 states), and wheat (eight states).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GRP is intended to protect the insured person against the financial consequences of a disaster that strikes all
or nearly all farmers in an area. It sets an expected county yield for each year based on historical yields, adjusted
for any trends. Whenever the actual county average yield for the year is less than the expected county yield by a predetermined
amount, an indemnity is paid. The principal differences of the GRP compared to traditional individual coverage area:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Coverage is based on a trend projected yield, which probably will exceed the average yield of all farmers insured
under individual yield coverage is there is a positive trend in yields for the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Higher coverage levels (deductibles are as low as 10 percent) at affordable premium rates can be sold.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, in the proper circumstances, GRP will offer risk protection that may be better than the individual coverage,
and may do so at a lower cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GRP has characteristics that make it unsuitable for managing the adverse financial consequences of crop loss in certain
circumstances. A farmer's yield each year must change in the same direction and by about the same amount as the county
yield if it is to be fully effective coverage for the individual. For example, if the county's yield decreases by 25
percent from the expected yield for that year, the farmer's yield also should decline by about 25 percent from the yield
he or she would have expected. In financial market terms, the ``beta'' or the farmer's yields and the county yields
should be near 1.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequate data are a limitation to further significant expansion of GRP. The concept as presently developed uses many
years (30 or more) of county yields. These data are routinely available only for counties in which the crop has been
grown in commercially significant quantities. Weather data and crop growth models may permit expansion into counties
in which the historical yield data are not available, but research is needed to develop and test these approaches.
Further, acceptance of GRP by bankers as collateral for loans is yet to be determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant expansion of GRP is not anticipated until its contributions to agricultural risk management can be measured.
No estimates of savings can be attributed to GRP because customer acceptance is not known. Customer acceptance of
the soybean GRP for the 1993 crop year was limited. Fewer than 500 policies (of nearly 700,000 total for the crop insurance
program) were sold. Even if the plan improves the actuarial soundness of crop insurance, the present volume of business
is not sufficient to make any noticeable difference in program results.

D. Implement Data Base of Taxpayer Identification Numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to the Federal Crop Insurance Act enacted in 1990 authorize FCIC to collect and use social security numbers
and employer identification numbers to administer its programs. These regulations were appropriately approved
and were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in late 1992. OBRA 93 further directed FCIC to implement a database of these numbers for certain uses not later than
the 1995 crop year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC implemented the database described above in January 1994, effective for the 1994 crop year. This database is
used to locate production history that is not reported by a person to assure that classifications assigned under the
nonstandard classification system (NCS_see paragraph E below) are used for both the individual who accumulated
the adverse history and any person having a significant beneficial interest in a crop produced by that person, and
for other related purposes. In particular, further efforts will be made to accumulate information about persons
involved in sales and servicing of crop insurance_agents, loss adjusters, and other insurance providers_so that
their contributions to achieving the target loss ratio can be measured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing this database will make both modified-APH and the NCS more effective by permitting FCIC and reinsured
companies to assure that all appropriate experience and premium rating factors are used. Incremental improvement
in the loss ratio due to modified-APH and NCS is difficult to quantify. The database will enhance those programs as
well as permit FCIC to systematically measure the performance of insurance providers for the first time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC will also use the social security numbers and employer identification numbers for the implementation of an Ineligible
File Tracking System. This system will be used to restrict (through an automated environment) producers who have
been declared ineligible to obtain benefits provided by the Federal crop insurance program. The FCIC expects to implement
the Ineligible File Tracking System beginning with the 1995 fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Expand the Nonstandard Classification System (NCS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC instituted the NCS for the 1990 crop year because evidence indicated that a small percentage of insured persons
had losses in nearly every year. The losses paid to these persons far exceeded paid premiums. For various reasons,
the insured yields for these individuals exceeded their apparent capabilities, and the premium rates were not representative
of the risks posed by these persons. NCS was intended to reduce the insurance guarantee and increase the premium rate
for such individuals. Modified-APH eliminates the need to reduce insured yields because the insured yield will be
based solely on actual yields when a person is selected for NCS. However, NCS will continue to increase the premium
rates as appropriate for those individuals who persistently have losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug, and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for the 1994 fiscal year
prohibited FCIC from using any funds appropriated to insure crops in certain counties unless an NCS program had been
implemented in those counties. Counties were affected if the loss ratio, after applying the 1993 premium rates, was
greater than 1.10 more than 70 percent of the years that the crop had been insured in that county. Approximately 2,100
county crop programs were affected by this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the 1994 crop year, NCS has been extended to 11 crops encompassing over 90 percent of the total value of insurance
in force. Additionally, all of the county crop programs affected by the Appropriations language have been included
under the NCS. Over 25,000 individuals (about 3.6 percent of all active policies for the 1993 crop year) were included
under this program. Not all of these persons had been insured during the base period. NCS also extends to persons who
participated in growing the crop in some way but who may not have been insured. These persons also are classified under
NCS so that the acreage cannot simply be insured under a different name to avoid the NCS classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, FCIC commissioned a study of the NCS to determine its effectiveness. A draft report of that study indicates
that the NCS reduced the loss ratio by 5 to 10 points. This report is undergoing final preparation as this Blueprint
for Financial Soundness is finalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC will expand the NCS program for the 1995 crop year. All eligible crops will be included, although greater flexibility
in selections may be authorized whenever program factors that led to poor experience have been identified. NCS is
not suited to certain insured crops (e.g., Texas citrus trees) that are subject to infrequent losses of great severity.
The additional savings from NCS are likely to be small in terms of the total business because the crops that constitute
the majority of premiums and losses already are included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Institute Premium Rate Adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Premium rates are essential to the success of the crop insurance program. Rates that are too low will not produce adequate
income and will lead to persistent losses. High rates will, paradoxically, likely lead to the same outcome. Excessive
premium rates discourage participation by a broadly based cross-section of the farming community. Instead, persons
who are most likely to collect indemnities will buy, and it is not likely that rates can be increased as rapidly as the
relative risk of the pool of insured persons increases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC has increased premium rates for all crops in a systematic fashion beginning with the 1991 crop year. Rates have
increased as much as 70 percent for some crops in some counties from the 1991 to the 1994 crop years. Decreases of up to
20 percent have been made for some crops in counties with histories of low losses. By an amendment to the Act in 1990,
Congress limited general premium rate increases to 20 percent annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above statistics indicate the amounts that FCIC has increased the base premium rates. The average premium rate
actually earned (actual premium paid divided by actual liability) may not have increased by the same magnitude for
various reasons. Most importantly, insured persons may choose a lower coverage level when the rate increases. By
doing so, they accept a lesser degree of protection but also pay a lower premium rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC proposes to continue premium rate increases as needed to help achieve the required loss ratio. The rate increases
made during 1991&hyph;1994 have done much to enhance the actuarial soundness of the program. However, the premium
rates for some crops and areas of the country remain below the levels needed to achieve the overall 1.10 loss ratio target.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of premium rate adjustments has been evaluated by using data for the 20 years from 1973&hyph;1992. The effectiveness
of the adjustments was measured by applying the current 1993 premium rate levels to the historical period from 1973
and all subsequent years. The loss ratios were recalculated by using the revised premium amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This method does not include any change in sales that may occur due to a higher or lower cost of insurance. It assumes
the 20-year base period is adequate to measure actuarial performance, an assumption that may not be the most appropriate
definition of actuarial soundness. Events such as a 1993 Midwestern flood may or may not be appropriate to include
in the 20-year base period for a particular area of the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, seven crops (barley, corn, cotton, grain sorghum, oats, soybeans, and wheat) constituted 75 percent of total
premiums. The loss ratio for 1980&hyph;1992 for these seven crops was 1.45, identical to the loss ratio for all insured
crops for this same period. Thus, changes in premium rates for these crops should be representative of the changes
that have been made for all crops in recent years. The premium rate changes for the seven crops through the 1994 crop
year are estimated to have been adequate to reduce the 1980&hyph;1992 loss ratio from 1.45 to 1.08. This aggregate
result meets the 1.10 standard required by OBRA 93, but only two of the seven crops individually meet this standard.
Within each of these crops, many parts of the country will meet the standard but others will not. Hence, additional
rate changes in 1995 and later years are appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC recognizes that premium rate increases are an important component of a viable crop insurance program. It is also
recognized that increasing premium rates to the levels suggested by the most recent 20 year experience may not be good
public policy. Extremely high premium rates will preclude realization of the social benefits and public policy goals
of the program because participation will be discouraged. If this happens, experience indicates that ad hoc disaster
assistance will be enacted. Such assistance is less likely to satisfy social objectives with regard to maintaining
rural communities and adequate supplies of food and fiber because it is uncertain for any particular year or region
of the country. Thus, a catastrophic adjustment process may be needed to temper the influence of a year such as 1993.
If the weather of 1993 truly is a 1 in 100 year event (or, as some have suggested, a 1 in 500 year event), its influence should
be tempered in terms of the premium rates charged to insured persons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to changing premium rates as needed, FCIC proposes to take a number of additional actions to enhance the
accuracy and adequacy of its actuarial activities. These include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop computer software and other tools to enhance the quality of the data used to establish premium rates and perform
actuarial analyses (``STATPLAN'' database, due for completion in October 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Plans to contract with a major actuarial consulting firm to review all aspects of FCIC's actuarial methods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enhance staff skills by additional training in analytical methods for existing personnel and more emphasis
on recruitment of actuarial trainees (ongoing) for appropriate functional units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continue to contract with external specialists such as the Economic Research Service, land grant universities,
the Cooperative Extension Service, and others (ongoing). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop models to measure sources of change in premium volumes and track the effects of premium rate changes as isolated
from changes induced by factors such as price elections, coverage level choices, insured crops, and other factors
that are not controllable by the rate-making function (development to begin immediately). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Improve Underwriting of Crop Insurance Contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Underwriting begins by establishing the basic terms and conditions of the coverage. These include defining conditions
that result in a covered loss, measuring the amount of that loss, and defining the responsibilities of the insured
and the insurer. Underwriting continues with proper classification of an insured risk. For example, planting crop
B the year after crop A was grown on the same acreage may be riskier that if other crops were grown the previous year. Some
land, such as flood plains, is more prone to losses. Quality of management also is important. A farmer who is organized,
plans, performs preventive maintenance on equipment, and performs field operations in a timely manner may minimize
losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comprehensive underwriting system requires effective risk management strategies and goals, standards, and documentation.
Initiatives to improve underwriting that began in the early 1990's will be continued as part of the strategy detailed
in this Blueprint. The following specific actions will be pursued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fully automate the actuarial documents to facilitate more comprehensive underwriting at the point of sale and to
verify the classification of risk in an automated environment (completed by the 1996 crop year). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop standards and classification systems to assess and classify individual risk, including completion of research
intended to develop a ``scoring model'' for risk that is based on measurable attributes of a person or situation similar
to a credit rating model (for implementation by crop year 1996 if this model is feasible). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continue to rewrite crop insurance policies to better describe the insurance coverage and limitations and to reduce
vulnerabilities to actuarial soundness that exist due to imprecise, unclear, or omitted terms and conditions (ongoing,
with major crops scheduled for the 1995 crop year). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Encourage development of supplemental or alternative insurance coverages authorized by section 508(b) of the Act
so that coverage may be improved with most of the risk remaining in the commercial sector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improved underwriting will improve program performance. However, meaningful measures to quantify possible benefits
are not readily available. For this reason, FCIC cannot attribute a specific dollar amount to the benefits of improved
actuarial systems and crop insurance policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. Emphasize Program Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCIC Compliance function is designed to confirm that the Federal crop insurance program is operated and delivered
as intended. Through internal reviews based on generally accepted auditing principles, it assures that program
controls are in place against excess losses due to waste, fraud and abuse. Compliance emphasis will focus on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Program Delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1987, the Compliance staff conducted reviews of program delivery to assess compliance with regulations,
policy, and procedure. That year, according to GAO and OIG audits, errors in claims payment represented an estimated
15 percent of all losses paid equaling $55 million of taxpayer dollars. Since that time, Compliance efforts have reduced
these errors to approximately 5 percent of indemnities but still need continued improvement. Losses due to claim
payment errors are not included in underwriting calculations of risk, so this reduction in excess losses has a direct
and immediate impact of lowering the program loss ratio without increasing program cost or premium rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further reduce claims overpayment the Compliance Staff will review the entire operations of each delivery company
in coordinated nationwide reviews. The review methodology was recently revised to reflect generally accepted auditing
principles and statistically projectable sampling techniques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning with the 1995 crop year, Compliance requirements will be expanded to define specific quality control and
performance measurement processes for each delivery company. Policy service error rates will be monitored. The
performance of each company will then be compared to an established national standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Program Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance reviews for several years have shown that a proportion of the excess losses are attributable to features
in program construction that produce unintended results. The Compliance Staff will conduct program performance
reviews that assess regulations, policies and procedures designed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse and that the
program, policies, and procedures perform as intended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, in 1989 GAO claims that construction of policy language in the California Safflower program alone resulted
in approximately $20 million in excess losses. It is not possible to determine how much of FCIC losses may be attributable
to unintended features of program construction. However, recent program performance pilot reviews of the peanut
program and regional irrigated practices resulted in an estimated 4 to 10 percent reduction in losses for those areas
that may otherwise have gone undetected.

For the past several years Compliance has conducted ad hoc program reviews on topical issues. These reviews will be
expanded to identify and target reviews for crop insurance programs with the greatest potential vulnerability.

3. Fraud Prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk of fraud is particularly acute in the insurance industry. Estimates for property-casualty insurance indicate
insurance fraud may represent as much as 15 percent of all losses paid. Recent efforts at crop insurance fraud detection
and subsequent prosecution have been increasingly successful. However, after-the-fact controls on program abuse
are not fully effective. Compliance will work with the delivery companies to focus on practical, cost efficient fraud
prevention. Compliance operations, program performance, and complaint reviews will emphasize identifying systemic
vulnerabilities and assessing program safeguards. Discrepancies noted in review findings will be evaluated to
determine the underlying causes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emphasis also will be placed on measures to control program abuse that include strict contract enforcement and pro-active
policy analyses that identifies potential abuse and targets additional claims review. These measures will be coupled
with the aggressive implementation of civil sanctions, agent/loss adjuster debarment, and designating producer
ineligibility in finding related to program abuse.

I. Assure that Adequate Risk is Borne by the Commercial Insurance Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendments to the Act in 1990 directed FCIC to assure that adequate risk is borne by the commercial insurance companies
reinsured by FCIC, consistent with their ability to bear risk and the availability of commercial reinsurance. For
the 1992 reinsurance year (a 12 month period that began on July 1, 1991 and ended on June 30, 1992), FCIC substantially
modified its Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA) with the commercial insurers which participate in the program.
Both the amount and the probability of losses on the part of the commercial insurers were increased in this agreement.
Additional incremental changes in the amount of potential gains and losses were made for both the 1993 and 1994 SRA's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GAO suggests in a report entitled Crop Insurance Program Has Not Fostered Significant Risk Sharing by Insurance
Companies (GAO/RCED 92&hyph;25, January 13, 1992) that the changes in the 1992 SRA are not significant enough in the
area of risk bearing by the commercial insurance companies. Still, the 1992 SRA fundamentally changed the manner
in which gains and losses are calculated, a subtle but effective measure to increase risk. The amount of potential
loss increased, but the change in the formula increased the chances that the company would lose in years of poor experience.
As a comparison, the commercial industry lost approximately $8 million in 1988 when the crop insurance program sustained
a loss ratio of 2.45 primarily due to drought in the Midwest. If that experience is restated to the larger 1993 premium
amounts, the loss still would have amounted to only about $10&hyph;$15 million. Results from the 1993 crop year are
not yet complete, but current estimates indicate that commercial insurers will sustain losses of $80&hyph;$85 million
although the loss ratio will be less than in 1988. The difference is caused by the SRA changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some will argue that industry-wide losses of $80&hyph;$85 million are not significant compared to overall program
losses that may be near $900 million in 1993. Two factors bear on this issue:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The ability of the insurance companies to earn reserves under the SRA, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The effect of losses upon an insurance company's operations in future years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commercial industry can bear a greater share of the losses only if there is corresponding opportunity to achieve
comparable earnings in favorable years. Over the long term, the industry must achieve a satisfactory rate of return
on invested capital, or it would make economic sense for participants to invest in other endeavors. The SRA must allow
adequate opportunity to earn this satisfactory rate of return. It also must permit accumulation of reserves to pay
losses in years that disasters strike. Under the present SRA and the conditions of actuarial soundness of the program,
there is no opportunity to accumulate the reserves needed to bear a large portion of a $900 million loss.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Losses directly impact the capital structure of the companies. An insurance company leverages its capital (the term
``surplus'' is used by the industry) to support the volume of business that it writes. As a general rule, an insurance
company is permitted by regulators to bear the risk associated with $2 to $3 of premium per $1 of surplus. The ratio of
premiums to surplus may be lower for risky lines of insurance such as multiple peril crop insurance. Thus, whenever
an insurance company loses a portion of its capital, its ability to accept premiums in future years is reduced by a greater
amount, which in turn reduces its ability to earn profits and reserves. These factors must be considered when the ability
of the industry to bear risk is evaluated, as is mandated by the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As appropriate, given the factors discussed above, FCIC will evaluate (1) the need to increase risk sharing with the
commercial insurance industry as the program achieves greater actuarial soundness, (2) reducing cessions to the
assigned risk fund by requiring the industry to share in losses for loss ratios that exceed 5.00, (3) changing the stop
loss provisions of the SRA, and (4) recruiting additional commercial insurers to participate in the crop insurance
business. These changes will be made incrementally beginning with the 1995 SRA that takes effect on July 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Improve Loss Adjustment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any actuarial and underwriting system can be affected by errors in adjustment of losses. These errors include both
overpayment and underpayment of claims. Underpayment would not seem to be a factor influencing actuarial soundness,
but failure to pay a loss when due will cause insured persons to question the value of the insurance and potentially
reduce participation. The insurance experience also will not accurately depict the nature of the risk insured, leading
to inaccuracies in future premium rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some problems in loss adjustment are directly related to deficiencies in underwriting. For example, if the crop insurance
policy is not clear on a particular point, the loss adjuster may find it necessary to make a determination in favor of
the insured person.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC will undertake the following initiatives to assure high quality of loss adjustment determinations so that results
are fair to insured persons and taxpayers:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Develop uniform loss adjustment standards that clearly specify the requirements for accurate determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Continue research to improve loss adjustment methods, such as yield appraisal methods and techniques for
unharvested crops, and measurement techniques for stored production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Strengthen the quality adjustment provisions of crop insurance contracts and develop standards to prevent
abuse of production determinations when quality losses are claimed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contributions of these factors to achieve the 1.10 target loss ratio will be measured by a reduction in improper
amounts paid on claims and a reduced error rate. The potential impact of these actions is difficult to quantify since
the initiatives to improve underwriting also affect this area. These actions are ongoing. Loss adjustment standards
for major crops and changes to the quality adjustment provisions are targeted for the 1995 crop year.

K. Marketing Crop Insurance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FCIC marketing efforts for 1994 will be directed by a strategic marketing plan based on information and data received
from market research compiled across the country. The plan's main objectives will be to inform members of the farming
community about changes in the program and to educate farmers about risk management, emphasizing the value of crop
insurance to farming operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FCIC will conduct a year-long media campaign targeted at publications and broadcast markets with an agricultural
audience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, emphasis on outreach to minority farmers, traditionally under-represented in the program, will be coordinated
through a Minority Outreach Marketing Plan that specifically identifies minority farmers in each of the 10 FCIC Regional
Service Offices.

L. Expand Participation by Introducing New Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous ideas for products that will enhance the quality and acceptance of the crop insurance program have been suggested.
These include cost of production coverage (several different concepts), dollar denominated coverage, revenue
insurance, replacement cost insurance, and others. FCIC currently has contracts with the Economic Research Service
to evaluate several alternatives in the context of public policy contributions, availability of data to support
the concepts, assessments of producer acceptance, and other factors. FCIC proposes to continue such research and
seeks comments about additional concepts that may be appropriate. Implementation of a pilot test of the best alternatives
will be pursued.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

M. Improve Accuracy of Other Program Variables
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes items that impact the program but are not easily categorized under a previous heading. These
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Unit division. A unit is a tract of land used to establish the amount of insurance and any indemnity. For example,
the crop insurance policy defines a unit as all land in a county that is owned by the farmer or rented for cash and planted
to the insured crop. This unit may be subdivided under certain conditions, including payment of additional premium.
Generally, insured persons favor a program that gives them great flexibility and freedom for establishing a unit.
Some research indicates that size of a unit may affect losses, i.e., a unit consisting of 10 acres may have a great loss
(in relative terms) than a unit consisting of 100 acres. This research, if verified, suggests that a surcharge may
be needed for small acreage units regardless of how these are formed (by dividing larger units or because this is all
the land planted to the crop). FCIC will examine the research and determine if this surcharge is appropriate, both
actuarially and as a public policy initiative. FCIC also will explore the potential to provide greater flexibility
of unit determinations as a tool to enhance program acceptance by customers. The pricing needed to support greater
flexibility must be determined before it can be implemented. Implementation of changes will be targeted for the 1996
crop year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Program dates. Program dates include sales closing, acreage reporting, cancellation, and others. Several
of these dates may directly affect the actuarial soundness of the program. For example, neither the farmer nor the
insurer should be able to predict the potential for loss on the sales closing date. However, a study by one university
indicates that farmers may achieve better than a 50&hyph;50 probability of predicting a loss with the current sales
closing date of April 15 in the Midwest. Arguments in favor of having a sales closing date as late as possible generally
focus on the need to maximize sales opportunities; i.e., that interest in purchasing crop insurance is greatest as
planting time approaches. In a draft report, the GAO has encouraged FCIC to close sales earlier. FCIC proposes to close
sales for the 1995 crop year by 15&hyph;30 days earlier than the present dates. FCIC requests comments regarding other
actions with regard to program dates that will facilitate achievement of the targeted 1.10 loss ratio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Staged guarantees. Staged guarantees reduce the amount of insurance when a crop is lost before harvest. For
example, a farmer who abandons a crop within 30 days of planting might be paid only 40 percent of the amount of insurance.
The concept underlying staged guarantees is investment costs; the farmer's investment is less than the total needed
to produce and harvest the crop. Some believe this approach will reduce outlays for indemnities and help achieve actuarial
soundness. However, in the long run its efforts could be to reduce premium rates from levels otherwise needed. The
impact of staged guarantees upon customer acceptance of crop insurance may be the valid measure of this concept. FCIC
specifically requests comments on this feature and assessments of its potential contribution to achieving the targeted
1.10 loss ratio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;De minimis yields. This term denotes a yield below which any production is disregarded for the purpose of determining
the amount of indemnity. The concept is advanced by interested parties as an equity issue_that it costs the farmer
more to harvest the crop than it is worth in the market. If allowed by the program, indemnities will increase compared
to the present provisions of the crop policies, which, in turn, requires higher premium rates to achieve the goal.
Readers are encouraged to comment on the desirability of increasing premium rates by an amount needed to permit this
feature to be included in crop insurance policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Suspension and debarment. Inappropriate determinations and poor administration of the crop insurance program
is alleged about agents, loss adjusters, and others who are involved with delivery of crop insurance. The SSN/EIN
database is intended to help FCIC monitor the conduct of these persons. However, monitoring in and of itself is insufficient
if there are no penalties for violations of program rules. FCIC proposes to develop clear and concise suspension and
debarment procedures for agents, loss adjusters, reinsured companies and others who fail to observe the highest
standards of performance in program delivery and administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Price Elections. The GAO recommended in a 1991 report that for the major crops, FCIC set its price elections
equal to the forecasts issued by the World Agricultural Outlook Board in its semi-annual estimates. These estimates
correspond to the cycle used to prepare the annual budget of the United States Government. These estimates are available
only twice each year. Based on a sampling of a few years, GAO stated that overall losses would be reduced if this recommendation
were adopted. FCIC is committed to offering a price election that complies fully with the requirements of the law.
In addition, the offer must be meaningful to farmers. FCIC requests comments regarding this recommendation and assessments
by readers of its likelihood of contributing to reduced loss ratios and improved participation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Readers are requested to identify additional issues that they believe are relevant and important to assist FCIC in
its actions to manage the program to achieve the target loss ratio while maintaining or increasing participation
levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Management Actions If Section II Are Not Successful
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The actions identified in Section II of this document represent a continuation of current management initiatives
that have been and continue to be important for the effective administration of a public program. FCIC believes that
successful completion of these actions will meet the objective of achieving actuarial soundness as required by OBRA
93. Several years must elapse before it will be possible to observe FCIC's achievement of the objective. In the interim,
attainment must be measured by realistic models of risk that adequately represent the crop insurance program. Flexibility
in managing the program to attain the objective while simultaneously achieving other important policy objectives
must be stressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Few options that do not adversely affect participation in a material manner are available in the event the actions
described in this blueprint are determined to be inadequate. One option is to focus better on defining the risk that
is included in the premium rates charged to current insureds. Extreme crop disasters (such as the 1993 flooding and
cold, wet growing season) tend to be widespread and occur infrequently. Crop insurance is not actuarially sound in
a commercial sense because the private sector cannot manage the magnitude of these risks or arrange the financing
over the long periods of time needed to accumulate reserves for a major disaster. This characteristic of crop disasters
argues that actuarial soundness perhaps should be measured on a basis that separates normally expected conditions
from the extreme disasters. This would serve to more precisely define the risk included in the premium rates for current
insureds, and the risk that should be amortized over longer time periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the above is not acceptable, another action would be to limit the liability of crop insurance to specific areas and
crops. This limitation could take the form of complete withdrawal of insurance in some cases, or limitations on the
volume of business that would be accepted in a year for a crop or area. Commercial insurers use this process to manage
their exposure to avoid concentrations geographically or by product line. Crop insurance may need the same management
of its exposures rather than accepting any and all risk whenever farmers decide to enter and exit the program. This
extreme action would indicate that the program was unable to completely fulfill its social and public policy responsibilities,
and must be regarded as an initiative of last resort.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Management Actions If Actions in Section II Are More Successful Than Needed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The greatest impediment to increased program participation will be high premium rates that might result from the
actions defined in this plan. Moderation of premium rate increases will be a priority if more stringent program administration
reduces the loss ratio below the target. If this occurs, experience should be examined to identify losses paid that
no longer should be expected. Once the impact of those losses is eliminated from the experience, some improvement
in premium rates would be anticipated. FCIC believes that the remaining management actions that have improved administration
of the program or that have better defined the coverage provided to U.S. agriculture should not be relaxed because
these generally represent good administration of public policy.

 The Access Board published its accessibility guidelines for the Americans with Disabilities Act in July 1991. 36
CFR part 1191, Appendix A. These guidelines, known as the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines
(ADAAG), have been adopted by the Department of Justice and the Department of Transportation as the accessibility
standards for newly constructed and altered places of public accommodation, commercial facilities, and transportation
facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act.

covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. 57 FR 60612 (December 21, 1992). Under Department of Justice regulations,
State and local governments presently have the option of using ADAAG or an earlier accessibility standard, the Uniform
Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), when constructing or altering buildings and facilities. 28 CFR 35.151(c).
The Department of Justice is expected to amend the regulations in the near future to eliminate this option. The Access
Board is also working with other Federal agencies to use ADAAG as the basis for the accessibility standard for federally
financed facilities covered by the Architectural Barriers Act. Eventually, it is anticipated that there will be
a single accessibility standard for all public and private buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with
Disabilities Act and the Architectural Barriers Act.

When it initially published ADAAG, the Access Board announced that it would periodically review and update the guidelines
to ensure that they remain consistent with technological developments and changes in national standards and model
codes, and meet the needs of individuals with disabilities. 56 FR 35410 (July 26, 1991). The Access Board also stated
that it would work cooperatively with national standards and model code organizations to achieve a single standard
over time that meets the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and that can be adopted as an accessibility
code by State and local governments throughout the country. Id.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Access Board will begin the process of reviewing and updating ADAAG this fiscal year by establishing an ADAAG Review
Advisory Committee (Committee). The establishment of the Committee would be in the public interest and would support
the agency in performing its duties and responsibilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Committee
will review ADAAG in its entirety and make recommendations to the Access Board on:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 14, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 65336) the final results of administrative review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina
(57 FR 48779, September 26, 1991). The review covered the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Silarsa did not respond to the Department's request for cost of production and constructed value information,
for the final results we relied on best information available (BIA) for Silarsa. As BIA, we used the dumping margin
petitioners had constructed by using the information on the record of the review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the final results, we received timely allegations of ministerial errors from Silarsa.
Silarsa requested that we correct certain claimed errors in the calculation of Silarsa's cost of manufacturing (COM)
and constructed value (CV), which affected the final margin we assigned to Silarsa. Silarsa pointed out that, contrary
to basic accounting principles, the Department had erroneously double-counted the cost of materials by adding ``1992
WIP (work in process)'' and ``1992 Finished Goods'' to Silarsa's ``1992 Purchases''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, petitioners stated that Silarsa's request was without foundation. Petitioners noted that the Department
assigned Silarsa a BIA rate of 54.97% because Silarsa terminated its participation in the review only after the Department
initiated a sales-below-cost investigation based on petitioners' allegations. Petitioners further asserted
that the arguments raised by Silarsa in its clerical error allegation did not constitute the type of ministerial error
discussed in 19 CFR 353.28(d), which covers ministerial errors of a clerical or arithmetic nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contended that Silarsa argued its case in its rebuttal brief and in its December 23, 1993, clerical error
allegation. In petitioners' view, this attempt by Silarsa to bring its post-decision reargument of its case under
the guise of allowing for identification of ministerial errors is an abuse of that rule and should be rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 2, 1994, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Silarsa S.A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Court No. 94&hyph;01&hyph;00030), issued an order remanding the final results of the 1991&hyph;1992 administrative
review of the antidumping duty order on silicon metal from Argentina for the correction of ministerial errors. We
agreed with Silarsa and the CIT that certain inventory items were double-counted in petitioners' calculation of
Silarsa's cost of materials. On March 17, 1994, the Department submitted its redetermination on remand to the CIT.
On March 24, 1994, the CIT affirmed the Department's redetermination on remand.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment to the Final Results of Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our correction of this ministerial error, we have determined that the weighted-average margin for Silarsa
for the period March 29, 1991 through August 31, 1992 is 24.62 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department will determine, and the Customs Service will assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate
entries. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, a cash deposit of 24.62 percent will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise produced
by Silarsa and entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the publication date of this notice.
The cash deposit requirement for manufacturers/exporters other than Silarsa specified in the final results of this
administrative review remain unaffected by this amendment.

On December 2, 1993, the Department of Commerce (Department) initiated antidumping duty investigations of silicomanganese
from Brazil and Venezuela. On March 25, 1994, Elkem Metals Company and the Oil, Chemical &amp; Atomic Workers Local
3&hyph;639 (petitioners), requested that the Department postpone its preliminary determinations until June 10,
1994, in order to allow the Department to consider and act upon the sales-below-cost allegations submitted by petitioners,
and to further evaluate the deficiencies in respondents' questionnaire responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 733(c)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the Act), as amended and 19 CFR 353.15(c), we find
no compelling reasons to deny petitioners' request and are, accordingly, postponing the dates of these preliminary
determinations until no later than June 10, 1994.

We preliminarily determine that color negative photographic paper and chemical components thereof (CNPP) from
Japan are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section
of this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on September 20, 1993 (58 FR 50331, September 27, 1993), the following
events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 15, 1993, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 15, 1993, the Department presented an antidumping duty questionnaire for CNPP to Fuji Photo Film, Company,
Ltd., hereinafter referred to as ``Fuji'' or ``respondent'' (see February 28, 1994, memorandum to the file). Respondent
submitted sales questionnaire responses in December 1993 and January 1994. The Department issued supplemental
sales questionnaires in February 1994. Respondent submitted the responses to these supplemental questionnaires
in February and March 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 14, 1993, respondent submitted a statement in support of the Department postponing the preliminary determination
in this investigation. On December 23, 1993, petitioner requested that the Department postpone the preliminary
determination until March 29, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1993). The Department granted this request on January
6, 1994 (59 FR 1927, January 13, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 2, 1994, petitioner submitted an allegation that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of
CNPP from Japan. On March 4, 1994, the Department sent respondent a critical circumstances questionnaire. Respondent
submitted responses to the Department's critical circumstances questionnaire on March 18, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1994, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondent requested that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary
determination, the Department postpone the final determination.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this investigation, color negative photographic paper is all sensitized, unexposed silver-halide
color negative photographic paper, whether in master rolls, smaller rolls or sheets. Chemical components include
sensitized (whether chemically or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions
used in making color negative photographic paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unsensitized silver-halide emulsions consist of silver-halide microcrystals dispersed in a gelatin and water
matrix after preparation and washing to remove soluble salts. Unsensitized emulsions are naturally sensitive to
blue and ultraviolet light, but cannot efficiently convert light to form a color image without further processing.
Sensitized emulsions have been treated to increase their sensitivity across the entire spectrum and/or treated
by the addition of spectral sensitizing dyes to make the emulsions selectively sensitive to specific wavelengths
of light. A coupler is a colorless, water-insoluble chemical capable of reacting with a silver-halide development
product to form a dye. A coupler dispersion consists of a coupler dispersed in a water-gel solution, and may contain
organic solvents, chemicals to stabilize the coupler and other substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically excluded from this investigation are all paper and chemical products not used in the silver halide process
which are used in other imaging technologies. Products outside the scope include toner and developer chemicals used
in electrostatic or indirect imaging processes (e.g., xerography), products used in laser printing, and instant
photography products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also excluded from the scope of the investigation is paper that is designed exclusively for use in graphic arts proofing
equipment and does not exceed 160 microns in thickness, and emulsions classified under subheading 3707.10.0000
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that are used in the manufacture of monochrome graphic
arts film or paper that are not used in the production of color negative photographic paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The color negative photographic paper subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings
3703.10.3030 and 3703.20.3030. Emulsions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.10.0000 and
3707.90.3000. Couplers and coupler dispersions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.90.3000,
3707.90.6000, 2933.19.3000, 2933.90.2500 and 2934.90.2000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience
and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid suspension of liquidation of non-subject chemicals, those items entered under the HTSUS subheadings listed
above, which are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process, must be accompanied by an
importer's declaration to the Customs Service to that effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be excluded from the suspension of liquidation ordered in this notice, all sensitized (whether chemically
or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions entered into the United States must
be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to the effect that they are not for use in the color
negative photographic paper production process and will not be used in the color negative photographic paper production
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 18, 1994, petitioner and respondent submitted comments on whether the chemical components are in the
same class or kind of merchandise as color negative photographic paper. Petitioner argues that the subject merchandise
constitutes one class or kind of merchandise, whereas respondent argues that the merchandise included in the scope
of investigation constitutes two classes or kinds of merchandise. We determined that color negative photographic
paper and the chemical components constitute one class or kind of merchandise (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum
from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). We based our determination on the criteria set forth in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this investigation, we have only examined sales of color negative photographic paper; we have not examined sales
of chemical components because respondent did not make such sales during the POI (see October 22, 1993, memorandum
from James Maeder to David Binder). We have determined for purposes of the preliminary determination that the color
negative photographic paper covered by this investigation comprise a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise.
Respondent reported products that are identical according to the Department's matching criteria, but have minor
cost differences based on the emulsions contained in each product. For purposes of the preliminary determination,
we are treating these products as identical and are making no adjustments for differences in merchandise between
the products as claimed by respondent in accordance with 19 CFR 353.57. This is because respondent failed to provide
a narrative description for its adjustments for differences in merchandise that explains the exact nature, source,
and size of each difference. We have instructed the respondent to submit a thorough description of its adjustments
for differences in merchandise so that these adjustments can be considered for use in the final determination (see
February 23, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

To determine whether sales of CNPP from Japan to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the
United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 22, 1994, respondent submitted clarifications regarding its response to section C of the Department's questionnaire
regarding U.S. sales. Respondent requested that the Department consider backup calculations for reported ocean
freight charges, and U.S. short-term interest rates. In this submission, Fuji also provided clarification concerning
certain Fuji-Hunt (a U.S. entity related to Fuji) delivery expenses and certain Fuji-Hunt indirect selling expenses.
This submission was received too late to be used for purposes of the preliminary determination; however, we will consider
this submission in our final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information submitted by respondent, we reclassified a certain movement expense as revenue, and added it
to the U.S. gross unit price. We added, where appropriate, freight revenue to the U.S. gross price, before adjusting
for freight costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates, and the following movement charges: foreign brokerage,
foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. broker's commission,
U.S. duty, and several U.S. inland freight charges including inland freight insurance. For certain inland freight
charges applicable to sales made through Fuji-Hunt, as minor charge-specific best information available (BIA),
the Department increased the reported charges to account for missing values. Additionally, we deducted commissions
and direct selling expenses which include advertising, credit expenses, and a combination of promotional expenses
which constitute other direct selling expenses. We recalculated U.S. imputed credit using the reported dates of
shipment and payment because the amounts reported by the respondent did not consistently reflect the method described
in the questionnaire response. We then adjusted the U.S. price for additional product preparation performed by certain
parties after exportation. The preparation performed by certain parties was treated as a component of total packing
costs which were deducted from USP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also deducted indirect selling expenses which include those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-USA (Fuji's
principal related U.S. entity) incurred in its general sales activities, those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-Hunt
incurred in its sales and marketing activities, foreign and U.S. pre-sale warehousing expenses, inventory carrying
costs, premiums for product liability insurance, and indirect selling expenses incurred in Japan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are accepting respondent's treatment of Fuji-USA's commissions
paid to an unrelated party and Fuji-Hunt's commissions as direct selling expenses and commissions paid to Fuji-USA's
employees as indirect selling expenses pending the receipt of additional information to be used for the final determination.
We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is
directed at their customers' customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made an adjustment to U.S. price for the consumption tax paid on the comparison sales in Japan. In

Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), the Court of International Trade (CIT) prohibited us from applying a
purely tax-neutral margin calculation methodology. Accordingly, we made our tax methodology conform to the instructions
of the CIT, and adjusted U.S. price for taxes by multiplying the home market tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise
at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the home market chain of
commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market consumption tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, the tax levied on the subject merchandise in the home market is three percent. We calculated
the appropriate tax adjustment to be three percent of the price of the U.S. merchandise net of discounts reflected
on the invoice at the time of sale (which, in this case, is the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that
is analogous to the point in the home market chain of commerce at which the foreign government applies the home market
consumption tax). We then added this amount to the U.S. price. We also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that
was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from the price to calculate
USP (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses and charges that were deducted from the price of the
U.S. merchandise). We deducted this amount after all other additions and deductions had been made. By making this
additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax
dumping is zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department instructed respondent to report by April, 1, 1994, a revised sales listing for sales of further manufactured
merchandise. Since respondent will submit this sales information too late to be included in our preliminary analysis,
and because respondent's first submission was too deficient to use for purposes of this preliminary determination,
we have not included further manufacturing sales in our analysis (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard
W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We compared the volume of home market sales of subject merchandise to the volume of third country sales to determine
whether there was a sufficient volume of sales in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV. We found
that the home market was viable for sales of CNPP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department excluded from its analysis certain sales of control paper, hobby paper, crystal paper, and softech
paper, because these sales were made outside of the ordinary course of trade due to the nature of the products and were
made in insignificant quantities. We omitted error entries and inventory adjustment entries because these entries
are not sales of CNPP, and because respondent did not directly tie these entries to the relevant sales in the CNPP database.
Additionally, we dropped cancellation transactions from the sales database, as respondent has stated that it cannot
identify the original transaction to which a specific cancellation entry applies. We also excluded certain low-priced
sales of CNPP because, despite a specific request to do so, respondent did not adequately explain the nature of, or
circumstances surrounding, these low-priced sales.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We used the Department's current related party test, which considers differences in the level of trade, to determine
whether sales to related customers were made on an arm's-length basis. For purposes of the preliminary determination,
we considered a party as related to respondent whenever respondent had substantial ownership in, or contractual
agreements constituting business control over, the party. See Appendix II to the Final Determination of Sales at
Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina (58 FR 37077, July 9, 1993) for
more information on the Department's related party test. We did not include in our analysis any sales to related customers
that we determined were not at arm's length.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated FMV based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing. We made deductions for inland freight, rebates
and discounts, and direct selling expenses, including promotional and advertising expenses, credit expenses,
warranty and guaranty expenses, and interest for guarantee deposits, where applicable. For those rebate programs
where respondent did not identify in the database which customer actually received the rebate, we made no adjustment.
We disallowed any rebate not established before the filing of the petition. For one expense claimed as a rebate, we
determined that the expense, although viewed as a direct selling expense for CNPP, was overstated through a misallocation
of the costs; consequently we did not make any adjustment for this expense, but will consider doing so subsequent to
verification and further explanation. With regard to one promotional program reported as a direct selling expense,
we did not make an adjustment to FMV because respondent failed to report the expense properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is
directed at the customers' customers. We deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs in accordance
with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. Where respondent's reported total packing costs in Japan for certain transactions
for certain packing forms omitted a particular packing processing charge, we added, as minor charge-specific BIA,
the reported average charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made the following deductions from FMV in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56. We calculated home market credit expenses
using the reported dates of shipment and payment. Where no payment had been received we used the average credit period
for home market sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deducted from FMV the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying
costs, warehousing expenses, product liability premiums, technical service expenses, and two promotional minilab
programs, up to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales. We reclassified these two promotional
programs as indirect selling expenses. While respondent had reported these as direct selling expenses, we have preliminarily
determined that respondent has not directly tied them to specific sales of CNPP. We also reclassified technical expenses
as indirect selling expenses because respondent's documentation illustrates that these expenses relate to general
long-term assistance, rather than customer- or sales-specific expenses. We offset commissions paid to unrelated
parties in the United States by the amount of indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market by respondent,
capped by the sum of U.S. commissions and indirect selling expenses incurred, both in Japan and the United States,
for U.S. sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have treated all movement expenses as direct selling expenses.
Therefore, in accordance with the decision in

Slip Op. 93&hyph;1239 (Fed. Cir., January 5, 1994), we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for home market movement
expenses. We recalculated indirect selling expenses incurred in the home market by reallocating certain rebates
and promotional programs as indirect selling expenses rather than as charges or direct selling expenses, respectively,
because we found that respondent misclassified these expenses. We classified product liability expenses as indirect
selling expenses because respondent's explanations demonstrate that its liability policy is general in nature
and not tied to specific sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included in FMV the amount of the consumption tax collected in the Japanese home market. We also calculated the amount
of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from home
market price to calculate FMV (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses, charges, and offsets that
were deducted from the home market price). We deducted this amount from the FMV after all other additions and deductions
were made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping
margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero. In addition, we calculated a re-adjustment of the amount of tax to take into
account the amount of packing expenses added to FMV (i.e., three percent of the packing expenses).

On March 2, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of CNPP and chemical
components thereof from Japan. We preliminarily find that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports
of CNPP from Japan, in accordance with section 733(e)(1) of the Act. To determine whether or not there have been massive
imports of CNPP (one of the criteria in a critical circumstances analysis) we compared the export volume for the six
months subsequent to the filing of the petition to that for the six months prior to the filing of the petition. We found
that exports of this merchandise from respondent during the period subsequent to receipt of the petition had decreased.
Unless we find that imports of the subject merchandise were massive, we do not need to determine whether there is a history
of dumping in the United States or elsewhere or whether there is knowledge that the exporter was selling the merchandise
at less than its fair value.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that color negative photographic paper and chemical components thereof (CNPP) from
the Netherlands are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section
733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margin is shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''
section of this notice.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on September 20, 1993, (58 FR 50331, September 27, 1993), the following
events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 15, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 19, 1993, the Department presented an antidumping duty questionnaire to Fuji Photo Film B.V. (respondent).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent submitted its responses to the Department's sales and cost questionnaires in December 1993 and January
1994. The Department issued deficiency sales and cost questionnaires in February 1994. Respondent submitted its
responses to these deficiency questionnaires in February and March 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 14, 1993, respondent submitted a statement in support of the Department postponing the preliminary determination
in this investigation. On December 23, 1993, Eastman Kodak Company (petitioner) requested that the Department postpone
the preliminary determination until March 29, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1993). The Department granted
this request on January 6, 1994 (59 FR 1927, January 13, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 2, 1994, petitioner submitted an allegation that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of
CNPP from the Netherlands. On March 4, 1994, the Department sent respondent a critical circumstances questionnaire.
On March 18, 1994, respondent submitted its response to the questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 8, 1994, respondent requested that, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), in the event of an affirmative preliminary
determination, the Department postpone the final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this investigation, color negative photographic paper is all sensitized, unexposed silver-halide
color negative photographic paper, whether in master rolls, smaller rolls or sheets. Chemical components include
sensitized (whether chemically or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions
used in making color negative photographic paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unsensitized silver-halide emulsions consist of silver-halide microcrystals dispersed in a gelatin and water
matrix after preparation and washing to remove soluble salts. Unsensitized emulsions are naturally sensitive to
blue and ultraviolet light, but cannot efficiently convert light to form a color image without further processing.
Sensitized emulsions have been treated to increase their sensitivity across the entire spectrum and/or treated
by the addition of spectral sensitizing dyes to make the emulsions selectively sensitive to specific wavelengths
of light. A coupler is a colorless, water-insoluble chemical capable of reacting with a silver-halide development
product to form a dye. A coupler dispersion consists of a coupler dispersed in a water-gel solution, and may contain
organic solvents, chemicals to stabilize the coupler and other substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically excluded from this investigation are all paper and chemical products not used in the silver halide process
which are used in other imaging technologies. Products outside the scope include toner and developer chemicals used
in electrostatic or indirect imaging processes (e.g., xerography), products used in laser printing, and instant
photography products.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also excluded from the scope of the investigation are paper that is designed exclusively for use in graphic arts proofing
equipment and does not exceed 160 microns in thickness, and emulsions classified under subheading 3707.10.0000
of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that are used in the manufacture of monochrome graphic
arts film or paper that are not used in the production of color negative photographic paper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The color negative photographic paper subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings
3703.10.3030 and 3703.20.3030. Emulsions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.10.0000 and
3707.90.3000. Couplers and coupler dispersions are currently classifiable under HTSUS subheadings 3707.90.3000,
3707.90.6000, 2933.19.3000, 2933.90.2500 and 2934.90.2000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience
and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid suspension of liquidation of non-subject chemicals, those items entered under the HTSUS subheadings listed
above, which are not for use in the color negative photographic paper production process, must be accompanied by an
importer's declaration to the Customs Service to that effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to be excluded from the suspension of liquidation ordered in this notice, all sensitized (whether chemically
or spectrally) and unsensitized emulsions, couplers, and coupler dispersions entered into the United States must
be accompanied by an importer's declaration to the Customs Service to the effect that they are not for use in the color
negative photographic paper production process and will not be used in the color negative photographic paper production
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 18, 1994, petitioner and respondent submitted comments on whether the chemical components are in the
same class or kind of merchandise as color negative photographic paper. Petitioner argues that the subject merchandise
constitutes one class or kind of merchandise, whereas respondent argues that the merchandise included in the scope
of investigation constitutes two classes or kinds of merchandise. We determined that color negative photographic
paper and the chemical components constitute one class or kind of merchandise (see March 24, 1994, decision memorandum
from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). We based our determination on the criteria set forth in

Period of Investigation (POI) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We initiated this investigation using a six-month POI from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 1, 1993, through August 31, 1993. On October 13, 1993, petitioner requested that the Department expand the POI.
We expanded the POI in order to capture U.S. shipments made pursuant to an October 1, 1991, contract with the single-largest
unrelated purchaser (see December 30, 1993, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).
We instructed respondent to submit foreign sales information of the subject merchandise for the month of November
1991 to be the basis for the foreign market value (FMV) comparison to the U.S. shipments made pursuant to the long-term
contract (see January 17, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

Such or Similar Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this investigation, we have examined sales of color negative photographic paper; we have not examined sales of
chemical components because respondent did not make such sales during the POI (see October 22, 1993, memorandum from
James Maeder to David Binder). We have determined for purposes of the preliminary determination that the color negative
photographic paper covered by this investigation comprise a single category of ``such or similar'' merchandise.
Respondent reported products that are identical according to the Department's matching criteria but have minor
cost differences based on the emulsions contained in each product. For purposes of the preliminary determination,
we are treating these products as identical and are making no adjustments for differences in merchandise between
the products as claimed by respondent in accordance with 19 CFR 353.57. This is because respondent failed to provide
a narrative description for its adjustments for differences in merchandise that explains the exact nature, source,
and size of each difference. We have instructed the respondent to submit a thorough description of its adjustments
for differences in merchandise so that these adjustments can be considered for use in the final determination (see
February 23, 1994, decision memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).

Fair Value Comparisons/Multinational Corporation Provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its petition, Kodak alleged that all of the criteria for invoking the multinational corporation (MNC) provision
have been met. To determine whether sales of CNPP from the Netherlands to the United States were made at less than fair
value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the appropriate FMV as required by the MNC provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MNC provision, contained in section 773(d) of the Act, requires the Department to determine if the following three
criteria are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Merchandise exported to the United States is being produced in facilities which are owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by a person, firm or corporation which also owns or controls, directly or indirectly, other facilities
for the production of such or similar merchandise which are located in another country or countries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The sales of such or similar merchandise by the company concerned in the home market of the exporting country are
nonexistent or inadequate as a basis for comparison with the sales of the merchandise to the United States; and,

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in one or more of the facilities outside the country of exportation
is higher than the FMV of such or similar merchandise produced in the facilities located in the country of exportation.
(In this comparison, we must adjust the FMVs for any differences between the costs of production in the two countries
(including taxes, labor, materials and overhead), pursuant to section 773(d) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the above criteria are met, then the MNC provision instructs the Department to compare USP to the FMV of such or similar
merchandise produced in one or more facilities outside the country of exportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the first criterion, Fuji Photo Film B.V. is wholly owned by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. in Japan. Further,
Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. produces the subject merchandise in Japan. Thus, Fuji Photo Film B.V. meets the first criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the second criterion, we compared the volume of home market sales of color negative photographic paper
to the volume of third country sales of color negative photographic paper, in accordance with section 773(d)(2) of
the Act and 19 CFR 353.48(a), in order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of color negative photographic
paper in the home market to compare to sales of color negative photographic paper to the United States. We found that
the Netherlands home market was not viable for comparison to sales to the United States (see January 11, 1994, memorandum
from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We determined, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.49, that Germany is the most appropriate third country market for purposes of
the comparison of FMVs under the MNC provision because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Germany is the largest single third country market;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The type of merchandise sold in Germany is more similar to Dutch exports of color negative photographic paper to
the U.S. than the type of merchandise sold elsewhere; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The channels of distribution in Germany are most similar to those for color negative photographic paper from the
Netherlands sold in the United States (see December 30, 1993, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the third criterion, we compared German and Japanese FMVs. To calculate the FMVs, we first compared the
German and Japanese prices to U.S. price (see the ``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice for a complete description
of how we calculated the German and Japanese FMVs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once we had calculated the two FMVs, we calculated a comparison adjustment for each product-specific FMV to determine
whether any of the observed differences in value between the FMV of products produced in Japan and the FMV of products
produced in the Netherlands and sold in Germany were attributable to differences in costs of production. The comparison
adjustment included the costs of materials, labor, fixed and variable overhead, general and administrative expense
and interest incurred in producing the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the German adjustment, the Department relied on the submitted cost information except in the following instances
where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) We excluded income from investment grants as this generally relates to income tax credits which are not considered
a production cost; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) We did not include foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from sales transactions as they are not related to
production costs; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) We reallocated CNPP specific research and development costs to reflect the benefits experienced by facilities
in Japan and the Netherlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Japanese adjustment, the Department relied on the submitted cost information except in the following instances
where the costs were not appropriately quantified or valued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) We excluded losses from the disposal of fixed assets as these costs did not appear to relate to the subject merchandise;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) We did not include foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from sales transactions as they are not related to
production costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) We reallocated CNPP specific research and development costs to reflect the benefits experienced by facilities
in Japan and the Netherlands; and,

(4) We excluded the enterprise tax in our calculation of general and administrative expenses because this tax is based
on income and is not considered a production cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calculating the FMVs, Japanese prices included a consumption tax and German prices did not. Thus, we adjusted the
Japanese FMV by deducting the consumption tax.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Next, we deducted the German comparison adjustment from the German FMV and the Japanese comparison adjustment from
the Japanese FMV. We multiplied the resulting amount for each product by the quantity of U.S. merchandise to which
the product was compared in order to provide for an equitable comparison. Finally, we aggregated the values. From
these aggregated values, we determined that the Japanese value was higher than the German value. Thus, the third criterion
for invoking the MNC provision has been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because all of the above criteria for the MNC provision have been met, we are required to base the FMV for the Netherlands
on sales prices by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd. in Japan (see the March 10, 1994, memorandum from the team to Barbara R. Stafford
for a further discussion of the Department's MNC methodology).

We based USP on exporter's sales price (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act, because the subject merchandise
was sold to the first unrelated purchaser after importation into the United States. Respondent did not provide a revised
sales listing for the foreign extended POI sales because of ambiguous language in our deficiency questionnaire regarding
the due dates. Therefore, we have not considered the extended U.S. POI sale for purposes of the preliminary determination,
but will do so for purposes of the final determination. Additionally, we determined that it is not necessary to examine
U.S. further-manufactured sales from the Netherlands for purposes of this investigation (see January 17, 1994,
memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 21, 1994, respondent submitted clarifications regarding its response to section C of the Department's questionnaire
regarding U.S. sales. Respondent requested that the Department recalculate a certain inland insurance expense
and a certain indirect selling expense. This submission was received too late to be used for purposes of the preliminary
determination; however, we will consider this submission in our final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on information submitted by respondent, we reclassified a certain movement expense as revenue, and added it
to the U.S. gross unit price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates and for the following movement charges: foreign
brokerage, foreign inland freight, marine insurance, ocean freight, U.S. brokerage and handling charges, U.S.
duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S. inland insurance. We added an amount for duty drawback. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deducted commissions and direct selling expenses which include advertising, credit expenses, and a combination
of promotional expenses which constitute other direct selling expenses. We recalculated U.S. imputed credit using
the reported dates of shipment and payment because the amounts reported by the respondent did not consistently reflect
the method described in the questionnaire response. We have adjusted USP for additional product preparation performed
by certain parties after exportation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also deducted indirect selling expenses which include those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-USA (respondent's
principal related U.S. entity) incurred in its general sales activities, those indirect selling expenses that Fuji-Hunt
(a U.S. entity related to respondent) incurred in its sales and marketing activities, foreign and U.S. pre-sale warehousing
expenses, inventory carrying costs, premiums for product liability insurance, and indirect selling expenses incurred
in Japan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we are accepting respondent's treatment of Fuji-USA's commissions
paid to an unrelated party and Fuji-Hunt's commissions as direct selling expenses, and commissions paid to Fuji-USA's
employees as indirect selling expenses. We treated all advertising costs as direct selling expenses because respondent
reported that all advertising is directed at their customers' customers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 CIT (October 7, 1993), the Court of International Trade prohibited us from applying a purely
tax neutral margin calculation methodology. Accordingly, we made our tax methodology conform to the instructions
of the CIT, and adjusted U.S. price for tax by multiplying the Japanese tax rate by the price of the U.S. merchandise
at the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise that is analogous to the point in the Japanese chain of commerce
at which the Japanese government applies the consumption tax.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, the tax levied on the subject merchandise in Japan is three percent. We calculated the appropriate
tax adjustment to be three percent of the price of the U.S. merchandise net of discounts reflected on the invoice at
the time of sale (which, in this case, is the point in the chain of commerce of the U.S. merchandise, that is analogous
to the point in the Japanese market chain of commerce at which the Japanese government applies the consumption tax).
We then added this amount to the U.S. price. We also calculated the amount of the tax adjustment that was due solely to
the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from the price to calculate USP (i.e., three
percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses and charges that were deducted from the price of the U.S. merchandise).
We reduced this tax adjustment to take into account the adjustment to U.S. price for duty drawback (i.e., three percent
of the duty drawback amount that was excluded from the tax base). We deducted this amount after all other additions
and deductions had been made. By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the
creation of a dumping margin even when pre-tax dumping is zero.

Foreign Market Value
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in the ``Fair Value Comparisons/Multinational Corporation Provision'' section of this notice, we
had to calculate FMVs in both Germany and Japan in order to make our MNC comparison. We calculated FMVs based on German
and Japanese home market sales prices, pursuant to section 773(d) of the Act. Respondent did not provide a revised
sales listing for the foreign extended POI sales because of ambiguous language in our deficiency questionnaire regarding
the due dates. Therefore, we have not considered the extended U.S. POI sale for purposes of the preliminary determination,
but will do so for purposes of the final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For German sales, we classified respondent's discounts and rebates to reflect the Department's standard definitions
of discounts and rebates (i.e., a discount is a price concession before invoicing, whereas a rebate is a price concession
after invoicing). We determined that certain discounts were, in fact, rebates, and were treated accordingly. Additionally,
we recalculated credit expenses in Germany using the reported dates of shipment and payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Japanese sales, we excluded certain sales of control paper, hobby paper, crystal paper, and softech paper from
our analysis because these sales were made outside of the ordinary course of trade due to the nature of the products
and were made in insignificant quantities. We omitted error entries and inventory adjustment entries because these
entries are not sales of CNPP, nor did respondent directly tie these entries to the pertinent sales in the CNPP database.
We also dropped cancelling transactions as respondent stated that it could not identify the original transaction
to which a specific cancellation entry applies. Finally, we excluded certain low-priced sales of CNPP in Japan because,
despite a specific request to do so, respondent did not adequately explain the nature of, or circumstances surrounding,
these low-priced sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, for Japanese sales, we made no adjustment for those rebate programs where respondent did not identify
in the database which customer actually received the rebate. Additionally, we disallowed any rebate not established
before the filing of the petition. For one expense claimed as a rebate, we determined that the expense, although viewed
as a direct selling expense to CNPP, was overstated through a misallocation of the costs; consequently, we did not
make any adjustment for this expense, but will consider doing so subsequent to verification and further explanation.
With regard to one promotional program reported as a direct selling expense, we did not make an adjustment to FMV because
respondent failed to report the expense properly. Because respondent failed to report shipment dates, we were unable
to recalculate credit expenses; thus, we made no adjustments for credit expenses. We treated all advertising costs
as direct selling expenses because respondent reported that all advertising is directed towards the customers'
customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Japan sales, we recalculated indirect selling expenses incurred in the Japanese home market by reallocating
certain rebates and promotional programs as indirect selling expenses rather than as charges or direct selling expenses,
respectively, because we found that respondent has misclassified these expenses. We classified product liability
expenses as indirect selling expenses because respondent's explanations demonstrate that its liability policy
is general in nature and not tied to specific sales. We also reclassified technical expenses as indirect selling expenses
because respondent's documentation illustrates that these expenses relate to general long-term assistance, rather
than customer- or sales-specific expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both German and Japanese sales, we used the Department's current related party test, which considers differences
in the level of trade, to determine whether sales to related customers were made on an arm's-length basis. For purposes
of the preliminary determination, we considered a party as related to respondent in Japan whenever there was evidence
of substantial ownership in, or contractual agreements constituting business control over, the party. See Appendix
II to the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from
Argentina (58 FR 37077, July 9, 1993) for more information on the Department's related party test. For both German
and Japanese sales, we did not include in our analysis any sales to related customers that we determined were not at
arm's length.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated German and Japanese FMVs based on delivered prices, inclusive of packing. We made deductions for discounts
and rebates, where applicable. For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have treated all movement expenses
as direct selling expenses. Therefore, in accordance with the decision in

expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We further deducted from the Japanese FMV the appropriate direct selling expenses, including advertising expenses
and warranty expenses. We deducted credit expenses from the German FMV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deducted German and Japanese indirect selling expenses, including inventory carrying costs, technical services
(Japan only), warehousing (Japan only), and product liability premiums (Japan only) from FMV, capped by the sum of
U.S. indirect selling expenses and the U.S. commission amount.

We deducted German and Japanese packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included in FMV the amount of the consumption tax collected in the Japanese home market. We also calculated the amount
of the tax that was due solely to the inclusion of expenses in the original tax base that are later deducted from home
market price to calculate FMV (i.e., three percent of the sum of any adjustments, expenses, charges, and offsets that
were deducted from the home market price). We deducted this amount after all other additions and deductions were made.
By making this additional tax adjustment, we avoid a distortion that would cause the creation of a dumping margin even
when pre-tax dumping is zero. In addition, we calculated a re-adjustment of the amount of tax to take into account the
amount of packing expenses added to FMV (i.e., three percent of the packing expenses).

Critical Circumstances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 2, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of color negative
photographic paper and chemical components thereof from the Netherlands. We will preliminary determine that critical
circumstances exist in accordance with section 733(e)(1) of the Act if we determine that there is a reasonable basis
to believe or suspect that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding requisite (A)(i) above, we normally consider whether there has been an antidumping order in the United
States or elsewhere on the subject merchandise in determining whether there is a history of dumping. Regarding requisite
(A)(ii) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more for purchase price comparisons and 15 percent or
more for exporter's sales price comparisons as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping. Because the preliminary
estimated dumping margin for all exporters of color negative photographic paper and chemical components thereof
from the Netherlands is in excess of 15 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping under section 733(e)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 19 CFR 353.16(f), we normally consider the following factors in determining whether imports have been massive
over a short period of time:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The volume and value of the imports;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Seasonal trends (if applicable); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The share of domestic consumption accounted for by imports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether or not there have been massive imports of CNPP, we compared export volumes for the six months subsequent
to the filing of the petition to the six months prior to the filing of the petition. We found that exports of the subject
merchandise from the Netherlands during the period subsequent to receipt of the petition had increased by an amount
sufficient to categorize the imports as massive. Accordingly, we preliminarily determine that critical circumstances
do exist.

Suspension of Liquidation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, and with 19 CFR 353.16(c), we are directing the Customs Service to
suspend liquidation of all entries of CNPP from the Netherlands, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section
of this notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date which is 90 days
prior to the date of publication of this notice in the

The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated preliminary dumping margin,
as shown below. The suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

 (59 FR 4691) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on cotton sheeting and sateen from Peru (48 FR 4501;
February 1, 1983). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer
of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation
or no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 25, 1994, ATMI and five member companies who are interested parties objected to our intent to revoke the
order. ATMI and its member companies were petitioners in the original investigation. Therefore, because the requirements
of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995, is estimated at $388,898. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Anaheim, California Geographic Service Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.

MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

research permit application P557A). This hearing was held in Silver Spring, Maryland. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application P557 is a request to allow harassment of marine mammals and sea turtles by low frequency (70 Hz) sound sources
at depths of 850&hyph;900m. This source is part of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) program, and is
proposed to be operated from March 1994 through December 1995 off Hawaii. The maximum duty cycle will be 8%, with a transmission
bandwidth of 20 Hz at a level of 195 dB (re 1 uPa at 1m), and with a spectrum level for the peak frequency (70 Hz) at 182 dB.
The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through a variety of methods.

 The Secretary proposes priorities for awards to be made in fiscal year (FY) 1995 using funds appropriated in FY 1994
under the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology
Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the proposed absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved
for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies
in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition,
the Secretary intends to invite applications that, within the absolute priority of correctional education, incorporate
one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) Advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional
education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also proposes to impose requirements related to the
priorities and other matters, and to use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition
only.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cooperative Demonstration Program provides financial assistance for, among other things, model projects that
demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector (including employers, consortia of employers,
labor organizations, building trade councils, and private agencies, organizations, and institutions) and public
agencies in vocational education (including State boards for vocational education, State or local corrections
or correctional education agencies, or eligible recipients as defined in 34 CFR 400.4). This program can help further
the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports
Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in
a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on
the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population.
The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described
a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
About seven in ten prisoners *&blank;*&blank;* are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require
them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve
two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p.vi).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success'' published in the Journal
of Correctional Education, found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison
were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees since the majority of the Nation's
criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. There were about 4.5 million individuals
under correctional supervision in the United States by the end of 1991, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Of these, 3.3 million, or approximately 73 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the
community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills,
and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing
their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic
life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without
basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will announce the final priority in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final priority will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations of
the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, the nature of the final priority,
and the quality of the applications received. The publication of this proposed priority does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only this priority, subject to meeting
applicable rulemaking requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Vocational and Adult Education's Office of Correctional Education coordinates programs for criminal
offenders with other Department of Education offices and other Federal offices, including the Department of Justice's
Federal Bureau of Prisons, National Institute of Justice, and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention.
The Office of Correctional Education collaborated with these Department of Justice offices in preparing this notice.

I. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Office of Environmental Management (EM) is seeking to award grants or cooperative agreements to applicants,
to fund (in whole or in part) projects, or cost share in projects, that will help EM implement a program to develop credible
risk assessment and risk management practices to protect the public health and environment at DOE facilities and
sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For more information about EM's needs in risk assessment and risk management, including information related to the
integration of risk assessment and risk management, interested applicants are referred to the National Research
Council's report ``Building Consensus Through Risk Assessment and Management of the Department of Energy's Environmental
Remediation Program,'' National Academy Press, 1994, and the presentations contained therein by Assistant Secretary
Thomas Grumbly and concerned stakeholders. Copies of the National Research Council's report may be obtained from
the Department of Energy by calling Ms. Mary Wilson, Telephone (202) 586&hyph;2661. It is strongly recommended that
interested applicants review this document prior to submitting a proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EM's program in integrated risk management faces two critical activity areas: First, a statutory requirement to
report to Congress on the risks to the public health and safety posed by the conditions at the Nation's nuclear weapons
complex; and second, the need for long-term assistance in risk assessment and risk management at DOE facilities and
sites. The first activity was mandated by Congress in Public Law 103&hyph;126, enacted October 28, 1993. The DOE is
addressing the Congressional requirement through actions that are on a separate track and not addressed by this announcement.
It is the second activity that this solicitation addresses, i.e., the long-term needs for assistance in developing
credible processes and methods for risk assessments and risk management decisions that include meaningful involvement
of affected parties, future land and facilities use planning, cost of proposed remediation activities, public and
worker health and safety, and environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the National Research Council's report and in specific remarks by Assistant Secretary Thomas Grumbly,
DOE is seeking to define the risks to human health and the environment on a site-by-site basis. Further, DOE is seeking
approaches and methods: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To systematically identify and characterize, on a site-by-site basis, the risks to human health and the environment;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To systematically identify and characterize the data gaps and uncertainties, and identify methods for filling
gaps and reducing uncertainties, in our present understanding of the above cited risks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To systematically review and recommend the process by which the above cited risks will be reduced; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To systematically review and recommend how public participation should be involved in risk evaluation and
how such risks should be communicated to non-technical audiences; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To systematically review and define the costs for risk reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the credibility of DOE and its site contractors is a serious issue that must be appropriately addressed
if valid and persuasive risk assessments are to be conducted, i.e., serious consideration must be extended to the
question of who performs the risk assessment, who performs the risk reduction assessment, who performs the cost assessment,
etc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Research Council has identified several obstacles associated with using a risk based approach at DOE
sites. These obstacles include the fact that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The use of risk assessment to set priorities for remediation is viewed with skepticism;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
&bull;Risk assessment is viewed as a mechanical process, without opportunity for public input, that often fails
to give due consideration to affected stakeholders; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Stakeholders have voiced concerns that risk assessments may result in an inequitable distribution of resources
both among and within facilities and sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding these obstacles, the National Research Council has concluded that a risk based approach to environmental
cleanup is both feasible and desirable. In order for such an approach to be effective in influencing Remedial Action
Decisions, it is necessary that risk management and risk assessment theory and processes, robust public participation
programs, and public policy decision makers be brought together and integrated into one coherent decision making
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EM is interested in receiving proposals from applicants that propose creative and innovative methods for providing
credible risk assessments and credible practices for implementation of risk-based decisions. Proposals should
address cost/risk policy and priority setting at the DOE sites involving decontamination, decommissioning, environmental
restoration, facilities transition, technology development, and site management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals that include an integrated-systems approach that includes technology-based solutions for reducing,
eliminating, or mitigating risks at the weapons complex are most desirable. In addition, proposers should demonstrate
an organizational capability both to work with diverse multi-disciplinary technical groups and to work with social
and cultural issues in the risk assessment arena. Additional factors to be considered in decision-making and in establishing
priorities include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Federal Facilities Agreements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;State and local agreements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Tribal agreements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Public participation and outreach to affected citizen groups; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Innovative approaches to development of credible risk assessments and implementation of risk-based decision
making; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Strategies and methods for identifying and filling data gaps and reducing uncertainties; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Environmental justice, socioeconomic and sociopolitical issues; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other environmental, worker, and public health and safety issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the country. Task I of the proposed project is designed to extend the implementation of a Risk-Based Data Management
System (RBDMS) in four states. Alaska, Mississippi, Montana, and Nevada would be given assistance with converting
data from existing data management systems; coding and internal testing of the RBDMS; preparing documentation,
training, and technology transfer; and project management. Task II of the proposed project would offer assistance
in conducting four regional training seminars related to Area of Review (AOR) investigations and environmental
compliance.

The Underground Injection Practices Council (UIPC) was formed in 1983 to work with various federal agencies, state
underground injection control (UIC) officials, municipal and county officials, representatives of environmental
groups, industry, scientists, and others on safe and effective methods for waste disposal. The UIPC, through its
Research Foundation, conducts a comprehensive program of original research and data collection and serves as a clearinghouse
for information on underground injection. The UIPC also conducts a variety of educational programs and serves as
a forum for the development of more sound regulations and technical standards.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Greater emphasis is currently being placed on the ability of states to justify their regulatory decisions, with interest
in developing reliable procedures for assessing the risks posed by oil and gas injection wells increasing rapidly.
Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, agencies that implement UIC programs are required to prevent subsurface injection
that endangers an underground source of drinking water (USDW). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The UIPRF just completed a grant from DOE that involved the investigation of state environmental, oil, and gas data,
and data management systems that pertain to underground injection control. The primary goal of this research was
to increase the base of technical and environmental knowledge related to the application of the UIPRF model that has
been developed to assess the risk of injection water contaminating a USDW. The project involved four major tasks:
(1) Conducting an inventory and needs assessment of the database management systems of the 21 states that have primacy
to supplement the UIC requirements for Class II wells, (2) conducting investigations of six state's data management
system capabilities and making hardware and software improvements, (3) conducting a Technical Symposium on Class
II injection wells relating to the application of the UIPRF model that was developed to assess risk of injection water
contaminating USDWs, and (4) conducting investigations of four states' data management system capabilities and
making hardware and software improvements. Task I of the current project proposed by UIPRF seeks to expand upon Task
IV of the just-completed grant by extending the implementation of the RBDMS in four states (Alaska, Mississippi,
Montana, and Nebraska). These states will be given assistance with converting data from existing data management
systems, coding and testing RBDMS, preparing documentation, and training efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i) criteria (A) and (D), a noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award to the
UIPRF has been justified. This effort is a continuation of the just-completed grant and opening up a continuation
effort to competition would have a significant adverse effect on continuity of the activity. The Applicant has exclusive
domestic capability to perform this activity successfully, based upon the unique technical expertise of the UIPRF
which will ensure maximum utilization of existing state, federal, industry and commercial sources of data necessary
to complete the study. This effort therefore is considered suitable for noncompetitive financial assistance and
would not be eligible for financial assistance under a solicitation, and a competitive solicitation would be inappropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE funding for this research is estimated to be $499,745 for the duration of the project. These funds will be used to
pay for the reasonable cost of research staff, administrative support personnel, consultants, experts, and printing
costs as necessary for the research project.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Energy Information Administration (EIA), as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent
burden (required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. 3501

), conducts a presurvey consultation program to provide the general public and other Federal agencies with an opportunity
to comment on proposed and/or continuing reporting forms. This program helps to ensure that requested data can be
provided in the desired format, reporting burden is minimized, reporting forms are clearly understood, and the impact
of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed.

 Currently, EIA is soliciting comments concerning the proposed extension of the Forms EIA&hyph;23, ``Annual Survey
of Domestic Oil and Gas Reserves,'' EIA&hyph;23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA&hyph;64A,
``Annual Report of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production.'' It is proposed that Forms EIA&hyph;23P and EIA
64A be extended without modification. For large operators reporting on Form EIA&hyph;23, the form will be modified
to also collect estimates of reserves and production associated with enhanced oil recovery methods and nonconventional
gas. This proposed modification reflects the growing importance to U.S. oil and gas supplies of enhanced oil recovery
and nonconventional gas. To offset the incremental burden associated with this proposed modification, the requirement
to report indicated additional reserves on Form EIA&hyph;23 will be discontinued. For small operators reporting
on Form EIA&hyph;23, the form will be extended without modification.

In order to fulfill its responsibilities under the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Pub. L. No. 93&hyph;275)
and the Department of Energy Organization Act (Pub. L. No. 95&hyph;91), the Energy Information Administration is
obliged to carry out a central, comprehensive, and unified energy data and information program. As part of this program,
EIA collects, evaluates, assembles, analyzes, and disseminates data and information related to energy resource
reserves, production, demand, and technology, and related economic and statistical information relevant to the
adequacy of energy resources to meet demands in the near and longer term future for the Nation's economic and social
needs.

Operators of crude oil and natural gas wells are the target respondents of the Form EIA&hyph;23 and operators of natural
gas plants are the target respondents of the Form EIA&hyph;64A. The amount of crude oil, associated-dissolved and
nonassociated natural gas, and lease condensate production and reserves by field are requested of major oil and gas
well operators. In addition a selected sample of small operators provides production and reserves of crude oil, natural
gas and lease condensate at a State level on the Form EIA&hyph;23. The amount of natural gas processed, natural gas
liquids produced, the resultant shrinkage of the natural gas, and the amount of natural gas used in processing are
requested of natural gas plant operators. In response to Public Law 95&hyph;91 Section 657, estimates of U.S. oil
and gas reserves are to be reported annually. These estimates are essential to the development, implementation,
and evaluation of energy policy and legislation. Data will be used directly in the annual publication 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
U.S. Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Liquids Reserves, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and incorporated in a number of other publications and analyses. Secondary publications which use the data include

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
This notice is for a proposed three-year extension of the Forms EIA&hyph;23, ``Annual Survey of Domestic Oil and Gas
Reserves,'' EIA&hyph;23P, ``Oil and Gas Well Operator List Update Report,'' and EIA&hyph;64A, ``Annual Report
of the Origin of Natural Gas Liquids Production,'' until December 31, 1997. Forms EIA&hyph;23P and EIA&hyph;64A
will be extended without modification. For large operators reporting on Form EIA&hyph;23, the form will be modified
to also collect estimates of reserves and production associated with enhanced oil recovery methods and nonconventional
gas. Implementation of this proposed modification is contingent upon the availability of resources required to
make the EIA&hyph;23 data system capable of handling the new data. To offset the incremental respondent burden associated
with reporting enhanced oil recovery and nonconventional gas reserves and production, and to focus the survey more
effectively on proved reserves, the requirement for large operators to report indicated additional reserves (a
reserves category that is not proved) will be discontinued. For small operators reporting on Form EIA&hyph;23, the
form will be extended without modification.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the applications for an original license for the Edenville, Secord, and Smallwood Hydroelectric Projects, located
on the Tittabawassee River, Gladwin County, Michigan and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for
the projects. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
projects and has concluded that approval of the projects, with appropriate mitigation or enhancement measures,
would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission established policies for the recovery of the costs incurred by pipelines in connection with the transition
required by that restructuring rule. One category of costs recognized by the Commission were the costs the pipelines
would incur to realign the gas supplies they had under contract with producers in order to make bundled sales. After
unbundling, as required in the restructuring rule, the Commission expected that pipelines would have to reform their
supply contracts to market levels or terminate the contracts altogether. In Order No. 636 the Commission adopted
the policy that pipelines would be permitted full recovery of prudently incurred gas supply realignment costs.

Subsequently, in cases concerning the implementation of the restructuring rule, the Commission decided that, in
certain circumstances, it would permit a pipeline to recover the difference between the contract price and the market
price as a gas supply realignment cost for a two-year period.

 The premise underlying the Commission's decision was that allowing the recovery of pricing differentials for a two
year period would be less costly than requiring the pipeline to hastily arrange to buy out of the contract.

The Commission's recent experience with pipeline filings to recover pricing differentials has raised questions
about whether this method for recovering gas supply realignment costs is an effective way to minimize gas supply realignment
costs_the Commission's original goal in approving the use of such mechanisms. If it is not an effective method for
minimizing gas supply realignment costs, then the Commission requests proposals for alternatives that are consistent
with the Commission's policy to permit pipelines the full recovery of their prudently incurred gas supply realignment
costs. The purpose of the conference is limited to consideration of the pricing differential mechanism. The Commission
does not intend to reexamine its other policies on the recovery of transition costs.

With this notice of Public Conference, the Commission is initiating an inquiry into whether permitting the recovery
of pricing differential costs (PDC) is an ``effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs.'' The Notice
includes the Commission's reassurance that, if PDC recovery is not an effective method for minimizing gas supply
realignment (GSR) costs, we will limit ourselves to the consideration of ``alternatives that are consistent with
the Commission's policy to permit pipelines full recovery of their prudently incurred gas supply realignment costs.''
Notwithstanding this reassurance, I am troubled by the prospect that the Commission would appear to be considering
a mid-stream change in its mechanism for the recovery of Order No. 636 transition costs.

 the Commission authorized PDC recovery for a period of two years. The Commission made clear that at the end of this period,
the effectiveness of PDC recovery as a means to minimize transition costs would be subject to reexamination. In particular,
the Commission has provided pipelines with warnings that:

The Commission already has established a procedure for determining whether, ultimately, these costs will be recoverable.
In addition to examining the eligibility and prudence of PDCs, if raised by parties to the proceedings, the Commission
has stated that the burden will be on the pipeline to demonstrate that the PDC methodology will minimize GSR costs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., 62 FERC at 61,125. Also, to ensure cost minimization, the Commission required
that Texas Eastern maintain a list of above-market contracts (List A) and a list of below-market contracts (List B)
and credit net revenues from List B gas sales against the pricing differential from List A gas sales.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission is initiating a proceeding, docketed as a rulemaking, to consider whether the PDC recovery mechanism
is ``an effective way to minimize gas supply realignment costs'' and to consider proposals for alternatives. I would
hope that the end result of this proceeding is not a termination or modification of the PDC recovery mechanism effective
prior to the end of the two-year period. Rather, I would hope that the record developed in this proceeding, together
with the case-specific records developed in the section 4 GSR cost proceedings, will be used to inform the Commission's
decision whether to terminate, modify, or continue the PDC recovery mechanism beyond two years.

Absent compelling evidence that the PDC recovery mechanism is not minimizing GSR costs, I would be reluctant to modify
the mechanism mid-stream. I believe that regulatory certainty is important, and that pipelines have relied on the
two-year time horizon provided by the PDC recovery mechanism. Therefore, I would urge my colleagues to consider carefully
the consequences of modifying this aspect of the Order No. 636 transition cost recovery procedure at this time.

Take notice that on March 25, 1994, the Corporation Commission of the State of Oklahoma (Oklahoma) submitted the above-referenced
notice of determination pursuant to &sect;271.703(c)(3) of the Commission's regulations, that part of the Atoka
Formation at a depth of 12,436 feet, underlying portions of Caddo, Blaine and Custer Counties, Oklahoma, qualifies
as a tight formation under section 107(b) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. The recommended area is described as
all of Section 6, Township 12 North, Range 13 West; Section 31, Township 13 North, Range 13 West; Section 1, Township
12 North, Range 14 West and Section 36, Township 13 North, Range 14 West.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of determination also contains Oklahoma's findings that the referenced formation meets the requirements
of the Commission's regulations set forth in 18 CFR part 271.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application for determination is available for inspection, except for material which is confidential under
18 CFR 275.206, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
Persons objecting to the determination may file a protest, in accordance with 18 CFR 275.203 and 275.204, within 20
days after the date this notice is issued by the Commission.

 New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the Phosphate Fertilizer Industry (Subparts T, U, V, W, and X). (EPA ICR
No. 1061.06; OMB No. 2060&hyph;0037). This is a request for renewal of a currently approved information collection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Owners or operators of phosphate fertilizer plants must notify EPA or the delegated regulatory authority of construction,
modification, startups, shutdowns, malfunctions, and dates and results of initial performance tests. Owners and
operators must install, calibrate, and maintain monitoring devices to determine the mass flow of phosphate-bearing
feed, and devices to measure and record continuously pressure drop across the scrubbers, and must keep records of
the mass of phosphate bearing feed. This industry is not required to submit excess emission reports. EPA or the delegated
authority reviews the records during routine inspections to ensure compliance with the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Burden Statement:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reporting requirements apply only to the initial performance tests, and since no new or reconstructed sources
are expected to become subject to the standards in the next three years, there is no burden projected for reporting.
The public recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 87.5 hours per recordkeeper
annually. The estimated burden includes the time needed to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather
the data needed and review the collection of information.

 Worker Characterization and Blood-Lead Study of Renovation and Remodeling Workers. (EPA ICR No. 1689.01). This

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Residential Lead-Base Paint Hazard Reduction Act, also designated as Title IV of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA), became law on October 29, 1992. Section 402(c)(2) of Title IV of TSCA, directs EPA to conduct a study of persons
engaged in various types of building renovation and remodeling activities. The purpose of the study is to establish
the extent to which workers involved in these activities are exposed to lead, or disturb lead and create a lead-based
paint hazard on a regular or occasional basis. The study involves a targeted survey of three categories of renovation
and remodeling workers in two cities, and the collection of venous blood samples from those workers. The categories
of renovation and remodeling workers are: union laborers, union carpenters, and independent non-union contractors.
The two types of data that will be collected are: (1) Worker blood samples that will be chemically analyzed for lead;
and (2) questionnaire data that will characterize the workers and will be used to understand differences in blood-lead
levels. The questionnaire will be administered either by telephone or self-administered and data collected includes
information relevant to lead exposure on: (a) Demographics; (b) work history (both current and long-term); (c) personal
characteristics and habits; (d) non-work activities; (e) medical history; and (f) previous training or knowledge
of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA will use data resulting from the survey to determine which groups of workers require training, certification
or educational materials. These data will also be used in conjunction with other studies conducted by the Agency,
and may be distributed to other agencies in summary form for use in addressing other requirements of the Act.

., and 40 CFR part 142, subpart B, the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR), that the State of Michigan
is revising its approved Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) primacy program. The Michigan Department of Public
Health (MDPH), has adopted drinking water regulations for 27 synthetic organic chemicals and 8 inorganic chemicals
that correspond to the NPDWR for synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic chemicals promulgated by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) on January 30, 1991, (56 FR 3526&hyph;3597) and, as amended on July 1, 1991, (56 FR 30266&hyph;30281).
The U.S. EPA has completed its review of Michigan's PWSS primacy program revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. EPA has determined that the Michigan rule revision meets the requirements of the Federal rule. Therefore,
the U.S. EPA is proposing to approve the MDPH's rule revision.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is announcing that it will temporarily cease review and processing of tolerance petitions received under the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and the associated registration applications received under the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) if any of the pesticide uses that are subject of the applications
and petitions appear to result in a residue that needs a food additive regulation under section 409 of the FFDCA and
such a regulation would be barred by the Delaney Clause. EPA is adopting this policy to concentrate on food additive
regulations currently in force which are inconsistent with the Delaney Clause and to avoid expending EPA resources
on action which may be revised once various policy issues are resolved.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
EPA's regulations regarding FIFRA registration in 40 CFR 152.112(g) require that all needed tolerances for pesticide
residues in food be in place prior to the approval of a FIFRA registration for the use of a pesticide which will result
in such residues. Raw food tolerances for pesticides are established under section 408 of FFDCA, 21 U.S.C. 346a, and
tolerances for certain processed foods and for feed additives (``food additive regulations'') for pesticides are
established under FFDCA section 409, 21 U.S.C. 348.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's current policy is that a food additive regulation is needed when there is a possibility that the processing of
a raw food containing pesticide residues would result in residues in the processed food or in animal feed at a level
greater than the raw food tolerance. EPA determines whether there is such a possibility based on the review of processing
data supplied by the applicant for registration purposes or the petitioner for a tolerance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 409, a food additive regulation for a pesticide residue may not be promulgated if EPA concludes that
the pesticide ``induces cancer'' in man or animal as specified in the Delaney Clause. 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3). In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the Delaney Clause barred the establishment of
a food additive regulation for any pesticide that meets the induce-cancer standard no matter how infinitesimal the
risk, 968 F.2d 985 (9th Cir. 1992), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
cert. denied
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 113 S. Ct. 1361 (1993). The court overturned EPA's interpretation of the Delaney Clause as subject to an exception
for pesticide residues which pose a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FIFRA and section 408 of the FFDCA contain no Delaney Clause and instead require consideration of both risks and benefits
in making regulatory decisions. Thus, pesticide uses which might qualify under the standards for registration and
a section 408 tolerance could still fail to meet the standard for a food additive regulation under section 409. Where
that is the case, and a section 409 food additive regulation is needed, EPA regulations state that a FIFRA registration
may not be granted, and it is EPA policy not to approve a section 408 tolerance for such a use either. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the wake of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the National Food Processors Association (NFPA) and other food processing and production groups have petitioned
EPA to change its policy linking actions under section 408 (raw food) and section 409 (processed food). Such a change
in policy would require EPA to amend its regulations concerning the registration requirement that all needed section
409 food additive regulations be in place. Additionally, the NFPA petition challenges the factual basis for EPA's
conclusion that processing studies are an accurate measure of whether processed foods will contain pesticide residues
greater than the section 408 tolerance and thus need a section 409 tolerance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the NFPA petition, EPA has published for public comment a notice (``NFPA petition notice'') summarizing
the petition and current EPA policies and procedures that are potentially affected by issues raised in the NFPA petition,
including EPA's procedures for determining when a 409 food additive regulation is needed and EPA's policy of coordinating
the decision on the 408 tolerance and registration with the 409 food additive regulation (58 FR 7473, Feb. 5, 1993).
Further, EPA also has released, on Febrary 2, 1993, a list of 32 pesticides that either have or need section 409 food
additive regulations under EPA's policy and that also appear to induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney Clause.
EPA intends to update this list periodically. Although EPA has not made a formal ``induces cancer'' finding for many
of these pesticides, EPA currently believes that most, if not all, of the pesticides classified in Group A, B, or C according
to EPA's Cancer Assessment Guidelines will come within the Delaney Clause standard. EPA places a high priority on
responding to the legal, policy, science, and factual issues raised by the NFPA petition and the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision. However, these issues are both complex and interrelated and cannot be addressed quickly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Reasons for Policy on Tolerance Petitions and Registration Actions Affected by Delaney Clause
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is adopting this policy at the present time as part of the priorities it has established following the decision
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision clearly established that the Delaney Clause bars the existence of a food additive regulation for any pesticide
that induces cancer in man or animal. EPA has determined that there presently exist as many as 50 food additive regulations
for pesticides that may meet the induce-cancer standard. EPA's first priority, thus, following the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Les v. Reilly
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision is to determine which of these regulations must be revoked and to do so promptly. Because food additive regulations
are only established in situations where EPA believes they are needed to prevent the adulteration of food, EPA's second
priority will be to determine what action should be taken, if any, against the FIFRA registrations and section 408
tolerances which are associated with the food additive regulations to be revoked. This issue has been made more complex,
as explained above, by the NFPA petition which challenges EPA's existing policies on this matter. Finally, EPA's
third priority is to address the many petitions for establishing food additive regulations which raise Delaney Clause
problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ideally, EPA would prefer to address simultaneously all pending petitions to establish food additive regulations
and all existing food additive regulations which are inconsistent with the Delaney Clause. EPA, however, has limited
resources. EPA estimates that in the next several months it will initiate revocation actions against over 25 food
additive regulations based on the Delaney Clause. EPA will also have to resolve what policy to follow on the associated
section 408 tolerances and registrations and implement those actions as well. This could result in EPA action against
80 or more pesticide uses. Aggressively moving to deny pending applications which raise Delaney Clause problems
could exhaust EPA's limited resources on pesticide uses not on the market while tolerances inconsistent with the
statute remain in place. Finally, EPA also must take into account that it receives thousands of registration and tolerance
actions each year. Devoting substantial resources to petitions raising Delaney Clause issues will delay action
on the more routine actions. This is especially the case where EPA has not yet resolved the important policy issues
relating to the interrelationship of section 409 food additive regulations and section 408 tolerances and FIFRA
registrations because actions taken today might have to be revised if EPA policies are altered. EPA will reexamine
this policy once it has resolved the policy issues raised by the NFPA petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will temporarily stop all review and processing work related to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
establishing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a registration and/or tolerance(s) for any chemical/crop combination in which: (1) either the chemical has been
found to induce cancer in man or animal or the chemical has shown evidence of carcinogenicity in animals or humans;
and (2) the pesticide residue in or on a raw agricultural commodity concentrates when that commodity is processed
or EPA otherwise determines that a food additive regulation is needed for the use. This will include any work on registrations
under FIFRA section 3, experimental use permits under FIFRA section 5, associated tolerances under section 408 of
the FFDCA, as well as food additive regulations under section 409 of the FFDCA. Work on tolerances and registrations
for other uses of the chemical, where a food additive regulation is not needed, may continue. However, EPA approves
or denies tolerance petitions in toto. Therefore, if a petition seeks a tolerance for any residue that appears subject
to the Delaney Clause, that petition cannot be approved and work on all tolerances in that petition will temporarily
stop. The Agency advises any person who has submitted a pending tolerance petition containing a tolerance that appears
to be subject to the Delaney Clause to amend the petition to separate the tolerances not affected by the Delaney Clause
so that work on these tolerances may resume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will also disapprove any State registrations approved under section 24 of FIFRA if the registration depends on
the existence of a food additive regulation that is subject to revocation under the Delaney Clause. The basis of such
disapproval would be that the registration is ``inconsistent with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,'' FIFRA
sec. 24(c)(3). States are urged not to approve such section 24(c) registrations, since State approval followed within
90 days by EPA disapproval will be disruptive and cause unncessary economic burdens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once the determination has been made that a pesticide use may result in a residue that appears to be subject to the Delaney
Clause, the PM will notify the applicant or petitioner in writing of the status of the tolerance petition and associated
application(s), i.e., that all review and processing work has been stopped and the reason for this action. These registrations
and petitions will continue to be considered pending; EPA is not denying these registrations and petitions. If a registrant
wishes to amend the tolerance petition after such notification to allow work to continue on uses not affected by the
Delaney Clause, such an amendment may be submitted to the PM by the usual procedure. The tolerance petitions or registration
applications will not be returned to the registrant or subject to any ``abandoned petition'' policy unless EPA, in
the future, prescribes some further action that registrants must respond to affirmatively within a set time period.
EPA will notify applicants and petitioners if and when the the Agency resumes review and processing of a petition and
associated registration applications on which review was stopped under this policy. Such notice may be by letter,
or by issuance of a policy notice or rule in which implementation is addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes its limited resources are best directed at first removing regulations inconsistent with the statute
and EPA policies and then making final determinations on petitions which, because they meet the above criteria, are
likely to be denied. To the extent, however, that a petitioner believes that EPA has wrongly characterized its petition
as meeting the criteria or that there exists some other basis for granting the petition, EPA will, on a case-by-case
basis, consistent with its obligation to protect the public health, adjust its priorities so that a formal action
can be taken on the petition. In addition, EPA will give any petitioner a denial, if that is requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 60 actions currently in review that EPA believes are subject to this policy. EPA will begin
sending individual notices to registrants and petitioners within 30 days of this notice and expects to complete notification
within 90 days. A registrant who receives no notification may assume that petitions and application actions continue
in active review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy does not affect the registration of new products or new uses which have an associated 409 tolerance that
has already been established even if, under the Delaney Clause, that tolerance would not now be granted. However,
EPA intends to revoke such tolerances in the future, and will, after revocation, immediately stop review and processing
of additional pending actions dependent on the tolerance at that time. Registrants who intend to submit new registration
applications under these circumstances may wish to await further Agency action before submitting applications
that may be affected by such revocations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final decision on whether to approve or deny the tolerance petitions and associated FIFRA applications that appear
to be subject to the Delaney Clause must await resolution of the complex, interrelated issues raised in the NFPA petition
and summarized above and will be staggered in such a manner so as to conserve resources for addressing currently approved
food additive regulations, tolerances, and registrations. Some of these issues may be addressed by pending legislation.
In the absence of such legislative changes, EPA does not believe that most of the issues will be addressed until later
this year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has received specific exemption requests from the Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture (hereafter referred
to as the ``Applicants'') to use the pesticide Imidacloprid (CAS 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to treat up to 13,000 acres
of apples to control aphids. The Applicants propose the use of a new chemical; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR
166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicants have requested the Administrator to issue specific
exemptions for the use of imidacloprid on apples to control aphids. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166
was submitted as part of this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicants state that aphids have been a chronic pest of apples in Oregon and Utah. Aphids feed on the plant tissues
of young trees, which can stunt growth and affect future tree productivity. On large, vigorous trees, the primary
concern is fruit damage. Aphids excrete such large amounts of honeydew that it drips on the fruit, causing russetting
or providing a substrate for the growth of sooty mold. The value of such damaged fruit is considerably reduced, as it
is diverted to a processing market. The Applicants state that some of the registered alternative pesticides, while
once effective, have lost much of their effectiveness due to build-up of resistant aphid populations. Others are
said to only provide suppression, and not adequately control aphids. One of the registered alternatives (phosphamidon)
that is still somewhat effective for this pest problem was withdrawn from the market in 1991, due to non-support for
re-registration, and existing stocks have been mostly depleted. Another chemical (mevinphos) was previously used
for this pest, but because of human risk concerns the manufacturer removed all labeled uses of mevinphos on apples
and pears from the label in 1993. Therefore, the Applicants claim that Oregon and Utah apple growers are left without
adequate means to control aphids. The Applicants anticipate crop value losses of approximately 10 percent without
the availability of imidacloprid this growing season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture propose that imidacloprid be used at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active
ingredient (a.i.), or 6.4 fluid oz. of product, per acre with a maximum of 5 applications. No more than 0.5 lb. a.i. (32
fluid oz. of product) applied per year. Oregon proposes treatment on up to 9,500 acres of apples. This would total approximately
4,750 lbs. of a.i, or 2,375 gal. of product. Utah proposes treatment on up to 3,363 acres of apples. This would total
approximately 1,682 lbs. of a.i., or 841 gal. of product. This is the first time the Applicants have applied for the
use of imidacloprid on apples. A section 18 for this use of imidacloprid was issued by the Agency to Washington State
on March 7, 1994 for up to 160,980 acres.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the applications themselves. The regulations governing section
18 require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical
(i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity
for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject
to the Field Operations Division at the address above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a state agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific
exemption for the use of imidacloprid on melons to control the sweet potato whitefly (SPWF). Information in accordance
with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SPWF is common on many wild and cultivated crops such as tomatoes, cotton, cucurbits and solanaceae. The sweet
potato whitefly (SPWF) is a relatively new pest on melons. The SPWF has caused severe economic damage to several other
commodities nationwide including cotton, lettuce, squash, beans, peanuts, and ornamentals. According to the Applicant,
SPWF populations for this season are expected to be widespread, and heavy enough to cause serious economic loss to
the melon crop. SPWF causes damage through feeding activities, and also indirectly through the production of a honeydew,
which encourages growth of sooty mold and other fungi. The Applicant claims that adequate control of the SPWF is not
being achieved with the currently registered compounds and that without imidacloprid, melon growers will incur
a significant economic loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with this request, the Applicant has also requested a specific exemption for use of a different chemical (bifenthrin)
on melons for control of the SPWF. The Applicant justifies requests for two chemicals, by stating that the imidacloprid
would be applied at or near planting/transplanting, as a soil incorporated treatment; since imidacloprid is a systemic,
it would be taken up by the small seedlings, and protect them from SPWF feeding during this early stage of development.
The Applicant states that bifenthrin, being non-systemic, is only of use as a foliar spray, which is of little value
during the early phase of development, when there is limited leaf area. Thus the Applicant proposes that use of bifenthrin
be allowed later in the crop season, as a foliar treatment, to maintain season-long control. The Applicant indicates
that imidacloprid would not be of use as both a soil treatment and a foliar spray, because its mode of action is such that
resistance development is a concern. The Registrant of imidacloprid will not support the use of this chemical further
into the growing season for this reason. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.25 lb. (dry) active ingredient (16 fluid oz. of
product) per acre with a maximum of one application per crop season on a total of 25,000 acres of melons. Use under this
exemption could potentially amount to a maximum total of 6,250 lbs. of active ingredient, or 3,125 gal. of product.
This is the first time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on melons. However, the Applicant
requested, and was granted, specific exemptions for the use of bifenthrin for SPWF control in melons for the past two
years (this is the third consecutive year for the request for bifenthrin).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator
may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency
conditions exist which require such exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of the mancozeb, available
as Dithane DF (EPA Reg. No. 707&hyph;180) from Rohm and Haas Co., to control leaf, stem blight, caused by the fungus

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternaria panax
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phytophthora cactorum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, on a maximum of 4,167 acres in Wisconsin. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this
request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Applicant, Alternaria blight rarely kills the ginseng root, which is the marketed portion; however,
loss of the foliage results in significant root yield loss in a harvested crop, and retards root growth and overwintering
ability in younger crops. Infestations of Alternaria blight in one season greatly increase the potential for epidemics
in subsequent seasons, since the fungus remains in the infected plant debris. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternaria panax
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 has become resistant to Rovral 50W, the only fungicide carrying a section 3 label for use against Alternaria blight
on ginseng. Rovral by itself can no longer be effective to control Alternaris. Other fungicides are also substantially
less effective than Dithane. If not controlled, the disease can be expected to infest all of Wisconsin's 5,000 acres
of ginseng.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed exemption 2.0 lbs of product (1.5 lbs of a.i.) per acre will be used on 4,167 acres. A maximum of 12
applications at a minimum of 7&hyph;day intervals will be made by ground equipment using a minimum of 80 gallons of
water per acre. A 28&hyph;day pre-harvest interval will be observed. Applications will be made by certified private
or commercial applicators or persons under their direct supervision. In addition, applicators, mixer/loaders,
and persons entering treated ginseng gardens to work must wear chemical-resistant gloves, long-legged pants and
long-sleeved shirts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18
require that the Agency publish notice of receipt in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been subject to
a Special Review, and is intended for a use that could pose a risk similar to the risk posed by any use of the pesticide
which is or has been subject of the Special Review. [40 CFR 166.24 (a)(5)].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency initiated a Special Review of the ethylene bisdithiocarbamate (EBDC) fungicides on July 17, 1987, which
includes mancozeb. A notice of final determination was issued March 2, 1992. The Agency took this action based on an
assessment of the risks from exposure to ethylenethiourea (ETU) present in, or formed as a result of metabolic conversion
from, pesticide products containing the active ingredient mancozeb. ETU, a potential human carcinogen, teratogen,
and thyroid toxicant, is present as a contaminant, degradation product, and metabolite of all the EBDC pesticides.
The Agency concluded that the estimated cumulative risk of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from all current 55 food uses was unacceptable and, therefore, canceled the following 11 food uses: apricots, carrots,
celery, collards, mustard greens, nectarines, peaches, rhubarb, spinach succulent beans and turnips. These cancellations
reduce estimated lifetime dietary risk to 1.6

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which the Agency has determined does not outweigh the benefits of the 44 retained uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations governing section 18 also require the Agency to publish a notice of receipt in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and solicit public comment on an application for a specific exemption if an emergency exemption has been requested
or granted for that use in any 3 previous years, and a complete application for registration of that use has not been
submitted to the Agency [40 CFR 166.24 (a) (6)]. Exemptions for the use of mancozeb on ginseng have been requested for
the past 7 years (1987 thru 1993). Mancozeb was granted for use on ginseng in 1991 and 1993 and Wisconsin went crisis
in 1992. An application for registration of this use has not been submitted to the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the
address above. The Agency will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining
whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer
Protection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On ~March 2, 1994, EPA approved two new products (one end-use and one technical) as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. K-Othrine SC 5.0 (EPA Registration Number 432&hyph;763) for use in and around residential, industrial, institutional
structures, and their immediate surroundings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Deltamethrin Technical (EPA Registration Number 432&hyph;762) for formulating purposes only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of deltamethrin, and information
on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency has considered
the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent of potential
exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which show that use
of deltamethrin when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice, will not generally cause
unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More detailed information on these registrations is contained in a Chemical Fact Sheet on deltamethrin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division

~These applications ~were approved on December 22, 1993 as Sentinel 40WG Turf Fungicide (EPA Registration Number
55947&hyph;132) for foliar application on turf, Technical Cyproconazole (EPA Registration Number 55947&hyph;133)
for manufacturing purposes only, and Sentinel 40WG For Repackaging Use Only (EPA Registration Number 55947&hyph;156)
for repackaging use only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the Administrator
first imposed the data requirements, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration
period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional
registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide
is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has considered the available data on the risks associated with the proposed use of cyproconazole, ~~~and
information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from such use. Specifically, the Agency
has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent
of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health and safety determinations
which show that use of cyproconazole ~~~during the period of conditional registration is not expected to cause any
unreasonable adverse effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that these conditional registrations are in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More detailed information on these conditional registrations is contained in the EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on cyproconazole.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Assessment of Medical Technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), through its Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA),
announces that it is initiating a Technology Assessment or a Technology Review (see below) of the safety, clinical
effectiveness and indications for the use of signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG). This technique reduces
the level of background noise that is present in the standard electrocardiography and allows the detection of signals
of very low amplitude, such as ventricular late potentials. The AHCPR is particularly interested in whether the performance
of SAECG has a positive effect on health outcomes and whether it influences the medical management of the patient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of AHCPR's process for conducting technology assessments and technology reviews was published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, December 3, 1993. In brief, the full assessment process includes an extensive review of the published literature,
consultation with other components of the Public Health Service (PHS), obtaining information from relevant specialty
groups and evaluation of information received in response to a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A technology review is a shorter evaluation of a technology; it may be performed if the medical or scientific
questions posed are limited, the available evidence is limited and the published medical literature is insufficient
in quantity or quality, or the time frame available precludes utilization of the full assessment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AHCPR is interested in receiving information which would help in the assessment or review of the technology as
described above. To enable the scientific community to evaluate the information included in the assessment or review,
AHCPR will discuss in the assessment or review only those data and analyses for which a source(s) may be cited. Respondents
are therefore encouraged to include with their submissions a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the sources
of the data and comments provided. Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information
collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
299a-l(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could identify an individual or entity described
in the information, or could identify an entity or individual supplying the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information and comments should be submitted in writing no later than July 5, 1994 to the AHCPR Office of Health Technology
Assessment at the address below.

State-Based Programs to Reduce the Burden of Diabetes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Health Systems Approach; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Availability of Funds for Fiscal Year 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
new applications for cooperative agreements to develop, implement, and evaluate State-based diabetes control
programs (DCPs). The program is designed to establish the DCP as a key component of an evolving health care environment.
The conceptual framework within which successful applicants should operate is characterized by four areas of program
activity: (1) Defining the nature, extent, distribution, and causes of the burden of diabetes; (2) Developing new,
effective approaches for reducing the diabetes burden which complement emerging health care systems; (3) Implementing
specific measures to ensure the widespread application of accepted standards, policies, and protocols to reduce
the burden of diabetes; and (4) Coordinating the diabetes-related efforts of the public health system with private
health care providers and payers, as well as with all appropriate governmental, voluntary, professional, and academic
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This announcement addresses two distinct levels of program support, both of which are consistent with the conceptual
framework described above. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which defines basic diabetes prevention and control
activities to be carried out through existing and evolving health care systems. The second is an Enhanced Program,
which is intended to introduce additional, innovative elements to a State's diabetes prevention and control efforts,
and is also carried out through existing and evolving health care systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led, national activity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life. This announcement is primarily related to Priority
Area 17, Diabetes and Chronic Disabling Conditions_with particular attention to populations at disproportionate
risk of developing diabetes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including minorities and the elderly. However, it also is relevant to other priority areas, including Physical Activity
and Fitness, Nutrition, Tobacco, Educational and Community-Based Programs, Maternal and Infant Health, Heart
Disease and Stroke, Clinical Preventive Services, and Surveillance and Data Systems. (To order a copy of Healthy

Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The program described in this announcement reflects a significant shift by the DCP from the direct provision of personal
health services to a responsibility for leadership and coordination of overall efforts of the health system to reduce
the burden of diabetes. Both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program are conceptualized by the four categories
of program activity described under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
INTRODUCTION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this announcement. The central objective of a Core Capacity Program is to assist the State to establish the basic
public health framework for leading and coordinating the efforts of the health care system and other public and private
resources to reduce the burden of diabetes. A Core Capacity Program must address all four categories of program activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An established Core Capacity Program is the foundation on which an Enhanced Program is built. The central objective
of an Enhanced Program is to move the State program vigorously into a position from which it can take the lead in ensuring
that diabetes-specific, community preventive health services are an integral part of a reformed health system.
An Enhanced Program must involve the addition of innovative approaches not employed in the Core Capacity Program
to reduce the burden of diabetes. Simple expansion of Core Capacity Program activities does not constitute an Enhanced
Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A recipient of an award for an Enhanced Program may choose to focus its initial enhancement efforts on fewer than all
four of the basic categories of program activity. However, at a minimum, the recipient must indicate that activities
will be undertaken in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first budget year related to (1) defining the burden of diabetes and (2) coordinating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the overall effort to reduce the diabetes burden. It is expected that each Enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program will be fully operational, including all four categories, within four years of the State's initial Enhanced
Program award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conducting activities to achieve the purpose of this program, the recipient shall be responsible for the activities
described under A., below, and CDC shall be responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for carrying out the activities described under B., below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Recipient Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes through the establishment and maintenance of a State-based surveillance
system which focuses on diabetes as a public health problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop new approaches to reduce the burden of diabetes through the development or adaptation of specific interventions
to be applied within the existing and evolving health care system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes by ensuring the widespread application of accepted
standards, policies, and protocols developed for that purpose. These should include protocols designed to prevent
or postpone the occurrence of the major complications of diabetes, as well as diabetes-related cardiovascular disease.
In addition, they should include protocols to ensure that persons with diabetes improve their efforts to achieve
levels of glycemic control consistent with the results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the establishment
of appropriate linkages with other governmental agencies; private health care providers; academic institutions;
community-based organizations; voluntary agencies; health care reimbursement organizations; national organizations
representing populations disproportionately burdened by diabetes, such as minorities and the elderly; and others.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. CDC Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Define and monitor the burden of diabetes by providing technical assistance in the development of surveillance
and other data systems to measure and characterize the burden of diabetes and its complications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Develop new approaches for reducing the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for, and
technical assistance in, the development or adaptation of specific interventions to be applied within the existing
and evolving health care system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Implement specific measures to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision of program guidelines for,
and by collaborating in the implementation of, accepted standards, policies, and protocols within the existing
and evolving health care system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Coordinate overall program efforts of the health care system to reduce the burden of diabetes through the provision
of program guidelines, and by facilitating communication among DCPs and with other governmental agencies, private
health care providers, academic institutions, community-based organizations, voluntary agencies, health care
reimbursement organizations, and others, to assist them in ensuring optimal coordination among all components
of the public health and health care systems to address the burden of diabetes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Community Services Block Grant Act as amended authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make funds
available under several programs to support program activities which will result in direct benefits targeted to
low-income people. This Program Announcement covers the grant authority found at Section 681A, Community Food and
Nutrition, which authorizes the Secretary to make funds available for grants to be awarded on a competitive basis
to eligible entities for local and statewide programs (1) to coordinate existing private and public food assistance
resources, whenever such coordination is determined to be inadequate, to better serve low-income communities;
(2) to assist low-income communities to identify potential sponsors of child nutrition programs and to initiate
new programs in underserved or unserved areas; and (3) to develop innovative approaches at the State and local levels
to meet the nutrition needs of low-income people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also requires that 20 percent of appropriated funds in excess of $6 million be awarded on a competitive basis
to eligible agencies for nationwide programs, including programs benefitting Native Americans and Migrant Farmworkers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Department of Health and Human Services is committed to improving the health and well-being of individuals through
improved preventive health care and promotion of personal responsibility. The Department seeks to unify the approach

The Department is specifically interested in improving the health status of minority and low-income persons. HHS
encourages community efforts to improve the coordination and integration of health services for all low-income
families, and to identify opportunities for integrating other programs and services for this population.

are applicable to the determination of low-income eligibility for this OCS program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Number of Projects in Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An application may contain only one project and this project must address the basic criteria found in Part C. Applications
which are not in compliance with these requirements will be ineligible for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Part C_Program Priority Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. General Projects_FN 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application should include a description of the target area and population to be served as well as a discussion
of the nature and extent of the problem to be solved. The application must contain a detailed and specific work program
that is both sound and feasible. Projects funded under this Announcement must produce permanent and measurable results
that fulfill the purposes of this program as described in the above. The OCS grant funds, in combination with private
and/or other public resources, must be targeted to low-income individuals and communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants will certify in their submission that projects will only serve the low-income population as stipulated
in the DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines (Attachment A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to comply with the cited Act may result in the application being ineligible for consideration for funding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an applicant is proposing a project which will affect a property listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places, it must identify this property in the narrative and explain how it has complied with the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended. If there is any question as
to whether the property is listed in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, applicant
should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer. The applicant should contact OCS early in the development
of its application for instructions regarding compliance with the Act and data required to be submitted to the Department
of Health and Human Services. In the case of projects proposed for funding which mobilize or improve the coordination
of existing public and private food assistance resources, the guidelines governing those resources apply. However,
in the case of projects providing direct assistance to beneficiaries through grants funded under this program, beneficiaries
must fall within the official DHHS Poverty Income Guidelines as set forth in Attachment A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications which propose the use of grant funds for the development of any printed or visual materials must contain
convincing evidence that these materials are not available from other sources. OCS will not provide funding for such
items if justification is not sufficient. Approval of any films or visual presentations proposed by applicants approved
for funding will be made part of the grant award. In cases where material outlays for equipment (audio and visual) are
requested, specific evidence must be presented that there is a definite programmatic connection between the equipment
(audio and visual) usage and the outreach requirements described in Part A.1.b of this Announcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCS also is interested in projects that address the needs of homeless families, welfare families, low-income and
minority health initiatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OCS welcomes project proposals which seek to develop innovative approaches to promote health, particularly among
low-income and minority populations. These proposals should have as their goals the reduction of incidences of premature
death and chronic disease among the targeted populations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs, and 45 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 100, Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities. Under the
Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All States and Territories except Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected
to participate in the Executive Order process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants
from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Applicants for projects to be administered
by Federally-recognized Indian Tribes are also exempt from the requirements of E.O. 12372. Applicants must submit
any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments
as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC
and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424,
item 16a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 45 CFR 100.8(a) (2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing
continuation awards. Applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications
and receive any necessary instructions. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements
as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory
comments and those official State process recommendations which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services
Administration for Children and Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Division of Discretionary Grants, 6th Floor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, DC 20447. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Attachment E of this Announcement.

4. Application Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications which meet the screening requirements in Section 5 below will be reviewed competitively. Such applications
will be referred to reviewers for a numerical score and explanatory comments based solely on responsiveness to program
guidelines and evaluation criteria published in this Announcement. Applications will be reviewed by persons outside
of the OCS unit which would be directly responsible for programmatic management of the grant. The results of these
reviews will assist the Director and OCS program staff in considering competing applications. Reviewers' scores
will weigh heavily in funding decisions but will not be the only factors considered. Applications will generally
be considered in order of the average scores assigned by reviewers. However, highly ranked applications are not guaranteed
funding since the Director may also consider other factors deemed relevant including, but not limited to, the timely
and proper completion of projects funded with OCS funds granted in the last five (5) years: Comments of reviewers and
government officials; staff evaluation and input; geographic distribution; previous program performance of applicants;
compliance with grant terms under previous DHHS grants; audit reports; investigative reports; and applicant's
progress in resolving any final audit disallowances on OCS or other Federal agency grants. OCS reserves the right
to discuss applications with other Federal or non-Federal funding sources to ascertain the applicant's performance
record.

Grantees are subject to the audit requirements in 45 CFR Parts 74 and 92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 319 of Public Law 101&hyph;121, signed into law on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 23, 1989, imposes [new] prohibitions and requirements for disclosure and certification related to lobbying
when applicant has engaged in lobbying activities or is expected to lobby in trying to obtain the grant. It provides
limited exemptions for Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Current and prospective recipients (and their subtier
contractors and/or grantees) are prohibited from using appropriated funds for lobbying Congress or any Federal
agency in connection with the award of a contract, grant, cooperative agreement or loan. In addition, for each award
action in excess of $100,000 (or $150,000 for loans) the law requires recipients and their subtier contractors and/or
subgrantees (1) to certify that they have neither used nor will use any appropriated funds for payment to lobbyists,
(2) to submit a declaration setting forth whether payments to lobbyists have been or will be made out of non-appropriated
funds and, if so, the name, address, payment details, and purpose of any agreements with such lobbyists whom recipients
or their subtier contractors or subgrantees will pay with the nonappropriated funds and (3) to file quarterly up-dates
about the use of lobbyists if any event occurs that materially affects the accuracy of the information submitted by
way of declaration and certification. The law establishes civil penalties for noncompliance and is effective with
respect to contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans entered into or made on or after December 23, 1989.
See Attachment F for certification and disclosure forms to be submitted with the applications for this program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This form is designed so that application can be made for funds from one or more grant programs. In preparing the budget,
adhere to any existing Federal grantor agency guidelines which prescribe how and whether budgeted amounts should
be separately shown for different functions or activities within the program. For some programs, grantor agencies
may require budgets to be separately shown by function or activity. For other programs, grantor agencies may require
a breakdown by function or activity. Sections A, B, C, and D should include budget estimates for the whole project except
when applying for assistance which requires Federal authorization in annual or other funding period increments.
In the latter case, Sections A, B, C, and D should provide the budget for the first budget period (usually a year) and
Section E should present the need for Federal assistance in the subsequent budget periods. All applications should
contain a breakdown by the object class categories shown in Lines a&hyph;k of Section B.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the authority granted the Secretary of the Interior by section 2 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (Pub.
L. 90&hyph;542, as amended; 16 U.S.C. 1273, et seq.) and upon proper application of the Governor of the State of Ohio,
85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks are hereby designated as State-administered components of the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1, 1990, the Governor of Ohio petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add 85.9 miles of the Big and Little
Darby Creeks to the National System. On January 24, 1992, the Governor of Ohio reaffirmed the same request which was
followed by a revised application dated February 3, 1992. This river had been designated a State scenic river on June
22, 1984, pursuant to the Ohio Scenic Rivers Act. In response to the Governor's request, the Secretary conducted a
complete review of the State application and documents associated with the designation decision. As a result of that
review, the Secretary has determined that 85.9 miles of the Big and Little Darby Creeks should be designated as a State-administered
component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, as provided for in section 2(a)(ii) of the Wild and Scenic
Rivers Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Ohio has fulfilled the requirements of the act by designating these segments as a ``State Scenic River''
and by adopting a program of action that will adequately protect the creek from adverse State actions. The National
Park Service evaluation of the river concluded that these segments of the Big and Little Darby Creeks meet the criteria
for scenic classification under the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the following river segments are classified as scenic pursuant to section 2(b) of the act to be administered
by State and local government:

Notice is hereby given of intent to prepare Category I plan amendments to the Diamond Mountain, Browns Park, and Ashley-Duchesne
Management Frameworks Plans (MFPs) and the Book Cliffs Resource Management Plan (RMP). The proposed plan amendments
will be prepared in conformance with the planning requirements and policies of the Federal Land Policy and Management
Act of 1976. The proposed plan amendments and accompanying environmental assessment will provide the basis for designating
additional public lands to those lands previously identified for sale in the land tenure adjustment portions of the
existing MFPs and RMP. The sale of public lands not previously identified in the above-referenced planning documents
will be subject to existing planning criteria and will meet the disposal standards established in section 203(a)
of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1713; 90 Stat. 2750).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Vernal District's Diamond Mountain and Book Cliffs Resource Areas are situated in northeastern Utah near the
Colorado-Utah border and include portions of Uintah, Daggett, and Duchesne Counties. The issue in completing the
proposed plan amendments is the degree of potential adverse environmental impacts that may occur should the public
land be conveyed into non-Federal ownership. As part of the proposed plan amendment process, an environmental assessment
will be prepared to provide a detailed analysis of the following resource concerns: wildlife and fisheries habitat,
recreation, watershed, paleontological and cultural resources, threatened and endangered plants and animals,
and land uses. Upon completion of the environmental assessment and approval of the proposed plan amendments, additional
public lands may be disposed of through public lands sales. The public, state and local governments, and other Federal
agencies are asked to participate in the proposed plan amendment process.

Section 215(a) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) (19 U.S.C. 2704(a)) requires that the Commission
submit annual reports to the Congress and the President on the impact of the act on industries and consumers in the United
States. Section 215(b) of the CBERA requires the Commission to assess the actual effect of the act on the United States
economy generally as well as on appropriate domestic industries and to assess the probable future effects of the act.
The Commission instituted the present investigation under section 332(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(b))
on March 21, 1986, for the purpose of gathering and presenting such information on the CBERA. Notice of institution
of the investigation and the schedule for such reports was published in the

On February 14, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Floral Trade Council,
Haslett, MI, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury
by reason of LTFV imports of fresh cut roses from Colombia and Ecuador. Accordingly, effective February 14, 1994,
the Commission instituted antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;684 and 685 (Preliminary). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission instituted these investigations effective November 26, 1993, following preliminary determinations
by the Department of Commerce that imports of certain steel wire rod from Brazil and Japan were being sold at LTFV within
the meaning of section 733(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b(b)). Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations
and of a public hearing to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the
Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 16, 1993 (58 FR 65732). The hearing was held in Washington, DC, on February 15, 1994, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on March 25,
1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2761 (March 1994), entitled ``Certain Steel
Wire Rod from Brazil and Japan: Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;646 and 648 (Final).''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License
No. DPR&hyph;61 which authorizes operation of the Haddam Neck Plant, and Northeast Nuclear Energy Company (NNECO
or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;21. DPR&hyph;65 and NPF&hyph;49 which
authorize operation of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 1, 2, and 3 (Millstone) respectively. The license
provide, among other things, that the Haddam Neck Plant and Millstone plants are subject to all rules, regulations
and Orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Haddam Neck Plant is a single-unit pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site located in Middlesex
County, Connecticut. The Millstone plants consist of a boiling water reactor and two pressurized water reactors
located at the licensee's site in New London County, Connecticut.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 26.21(b) of title 10, of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that Fitness-For-Duty (FFD) refresher
training be completed on a nominal 12-month frequency or more frequently where the need is indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated February 10, 1994, the licensees requested a one-time exemption from their requirements of 10 CFR
26.21(b). The exemption is needed because the licensees perform FFD refresher training as part of a consolidation
of various annual training requirements. While the consolidation of annual training requirements results in substantial
gains in efficiency, it also results in the potential for individuals who would have been scheduled to receive FFD
refresher training during January 1994, to go until October 1994, before receiving this training. In addition, there
will be individuals whose scheduled training interval is extended for shorter durations. However, the 9-month delay
is the most bounding, so an overall extension from 12 to 21 months has been requested by the licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensees state in there February 10, 1994, application that they are confident that affected personnel understand
the FFD program and requirements, and that no adverse impact will result from this requested change. Between the four
units, approximately 15 percent of the on-shift personnel will fall outside of the nominal 12-month window. All of
the individuals have received FFD training in the past, and will read and sign a synopsis of the FFD requirements prior
to exceeding the nominal 12-month window. In addition, within each shift, the supervisory personnel will be trained
within the nominal 12-month frequency pursuant to 10 CFR 26.22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has reviewed the licensees' rationale for a one-time exemption from 10 CFR 26.21(b) in order not to
separate FFD refresher training from other annual training requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its review, the Commission finds the licensees have shown good cause for the requested exemption from 10 CFR
26.21(b). Therefore, the exemption to extend the time requirement to 21 months for completing FFD refresher training
is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 26.6, the exemption is authorized by law and will
not endanger life or property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest and hereby
grants an exemption from the time requirements of 10 CFR 26.21(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuance of this exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of human environment (59 FR 13750).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has received, by letter dated
November 18, 1993 from Energy Fuels Nuclear, Inc., an application for a source material license to commercially produce
uranium oxide by in-situ leaching (ISL) of uranium ores, at its Reno Creek, Wyoming ISL facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility will be located approximately 12 miles southwest of the town of Wright, in Campbell County, Wyoming.
The operation is anticipated to extract about 181,440 kilograms (400,000 pounds) &blank;of &blank;uranium &blank;oxide

) per year, with a maximum quantity of 7000 kilograms (15,400 pounds) of source material on site at any one time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant plans to use a series of injection wells, which will introduce hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate/bicarbonate
(lixiviant) into the ore zone; and extract the mobilized uranium through a series of pumping wells. The uranium-rich
water will be routed to an on-site processing building (satellite plant) where the uranium will be concentrated in
ion-exchange resin tanks. The uranium-depleted fluids will be recharged with lixiviant and recirculated into the
ore zone through the injection wells to mobilize more uranium. The loaded ion-exchange resin will be hydraulically
transferred to tank trucks and periodically shipped to another NRC-licensed facility for elution and further processing.
The designed production rate for total circulation of leaching solutions will be about 7570 liters per minute (2000
gallons per minute). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the extraction of the uranium from the ore zone, the ground water affected by the mining operation will be
restored to a quality of use equal to or better than the water uses prior to extraction operations. The ground-water
restoration techniques will include pumping the well field without lixiviant injection (ground-water sweep),
followed by circulating and injecting water treated by reverse osmosis to achieve final restoration. Ground-water
quality will be monitored in perimeter monitoring wells during extraction operations and ground-water restoration
activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from the requirements
of 10 CFR 50.71(e)(3)(i) to Texas Utilities Electric Company (the licensee) for the Comanche Peak Steam Electric
Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in Somervell County, Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 50.71(e)(3)(i) of title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations requires the licensees of nuclear power reactors
to submit an Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The UFSAR is defined as ``a revision of the original FSAR
[Final Safety Analysis Report] containing those original pages that are still applicable plus new replacement pages.''
By letter dated October 14, 1993, the licensee requested an exemption from 10 CFR 50.71(e) that would eliminate the
requirement to resubmit those original pages of the FSAR that are still applicable when submitting the UFSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has maintained the FSAR current since the original FSAR submittal in 1978 to the present by issuing amendments
to the FSAR, which contain new replacement pages, approximately every three months. The licensee has committed to
maintain the FSAR using this process until the issuance of the UFSAR. The final amendment to the FSAR, containing only
replacement pages, would convert the FSAR to the UFSAR. The amendment to convert the FSAR to the UFSAR would be submitted
by February 2, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 50.71(e) requires that licensee submit, within two years of receiving an operating license, a UFSAR that
contains the original FSAR pages that are still applicable and new replacement pages. The purpose of this requirement
is to assure that the Final Safety Analysis Report is updated to contain the latest material developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station FSAR is approximately 7,500 to 8,000 pages of text and tables, and 1,500 to
2,000 sheets of figures. As the licensee has maintained the FSAR current by frequent amendments, the vast majority
of this material does not require revision and the number of new replacement pages associated with the UFSAR submittal
would be relatively small. Thus, the CPSES FSAR meets the intent of 10 CFR 50.71(e) for issuance of the UFSAR because
it contains the latest material developed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, an exemption is warranted since the licensee has maintained the FSAR in a manner that is consistent with
the underlying purpose of issuing the UFSAR in accordance with 10 CFR 50.71(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed exemption affects only the size of the UFSAR submittal and does not affect the risk of facility accidents.
Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not differ from those determined previously, and the proposed exemption
does not otherwise affect facility radiological effluents, or any significant occupational exposures. With regard
to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption does not affect plant nonradiological effluents
and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no measurable radiological
or nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternatives either will have no environmental impact or will have a greater environmental impact. The principal
alternative to the exemption would be to require that the licensee submit the original FSAR pages that are still applicable
with the UFSAR replacement pages. Such an action would not enhance the protection of the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, dated September 1981, and Supplement dated October 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Agencies and Persons Contacted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request. The staff consulted with the State of Texas regarding the environmental
impact of the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. On the
basis of the environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on
the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated October 14, 1993, which is
available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the University of Texas at Arlington Library, Government Publications/Maps, 701 South

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to add new Commentary .02 to Rule 126(g), to allow a member who has an order to buy and an order to
sell 25,000 shares or more of the same security, where neither order is for the account of a member or a member organization,
to cross those orders at a price that is at or within the prevailing quotation without the transaction being broken
up at the cross price. Thus, the member's bid or offer would be entitled to priority at such cross price, irrespective
of pre-existing bids or offers at that price. The proposal, therefore, is intended to facilitate execution of agency
cross transactions on the Exchange. In addition, confining the proposed size priority threshold to block size orders
of 25,000 shares or more would limit the effects of the rule primarily to actively traded, liquid securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The member would be required to follow the crossing procedures of Rule 151 and make a public bid and offer on behalf of
both sides of the cross. However, unlike existing block cross procedures under Rule 126(g), Commentary .01,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 such an order would not be required to be on parity with other orders on the Floor; that is, it would not be required that
the priority of earlier bids and offers first be removed, by means of a sale, before effecting the cross. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal furthers the important auction market principle of price improvement by allowing another member to
trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross transaction to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross
price; however, the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer at a price which is the same as the cross price.
The member who is providing a better price to one side of the cross transaction would be required to trade with all other
market interest having priority at that price before trading with any part of the cross transaction. A transaction
effected at the cross price in reliance on Commentary .02 would be printed as ``stopped stock.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid conflict with the proposed agency cross rule, Commentary .01 of Rule 126(g) would be amended so as to afford
size precedence to orders to cross 25,000 shares or more only when members or member organizations are involved as
principal on one or both sides of the cross. As is currently the case, such orders to cross would be entitled to precedence
only when they are on parity with other orders on the Floor.

(a) Each member who is named as a party to an arbitration proceeding, whether in a Claim, Counterclaim, Crossclaim
or Third-Party claim, shall be assessed a $200 non-refundable surcharge when the Arbitration Department perfects
service of the claim naming the member on any party to the proceeding. For each associated person who is named, the surcharge
shall be assessed against the member or members which employed the associated person at the time of the events which
gave rise to the dispute, claim or controversy. No member shall be assessed more than a single surcharge in any arbitration
proceeding. The surcharge shall not be subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) or 44(c) of the Code.

In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed

examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B),

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 25, 1994, the NASD filed SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;11 adopting section 45 to the Code of Arbitration
Procedure (``Code'') to impose a $200 non-refundable surcharge on any member named as a party to an arbitration proceeding.
The last line of section 45(a) stated that the surcharge would not be subject to reimbursement under Subsection 43(c)
of the Code, which references customer disputes.

Subsequently, the NASD determined that it had inadvertently omitted reference in the last sentence of new section
45(a) to Subsection 44(c), which provision relates to industry and clearing controversies. The NASD is, therefore,
proposing to amend Subsection 45(a) to the Code of Arbitration Procedure to clarify that the member surcharge is not
subject to reimbursement under Subsections 43(c) and 44(c) of the Code. Thus, the provision of Subsection 45(a) that
the member surcharge is not subject to reimbursement shall apply in cases involving customer disputes as well as industry
and clearing controversies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the provisions of section 15A(b)(5) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 which require that the rules of the Association provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and
other charges among members in that the proposed rule clarifies that the member surcharge will be assessed equitably
on each member who is named and for whom service is perfected in an arbitration proceeding.

The purpose of the Rule 476A procedure is to provide for a response to a rule violation when a meaningful sanction is
appropriate, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under Rule 476 is not suitable because such a proceeding
would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the minor nature of the violation. Rule 476A
provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules or policies, while preserving
the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. Violations of these rules and
policies that are deemed by the Exchange not to be minor in nature are also subject to formal disciplinary proceedings
under Exchange Rule 476. The list of rules and policies which are eligible for the Rule 476A procedures specifies those
rule violations which may be the subject of fines under the rule and also includes a schedule of fines.

The Exchange is seeking approval to add to the list of rules subject to possible imposition of fines under Rule 476A
its policy with respect to a requirement for new members of the Exchange to have their order executions observed by
another member for a period of two weeks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of their training regimen, new Exchange members are required to participate in a New Member Orientation Program
(``Program''). The Program, consisting of six one-hour sessions over a two-week period, is designed to familiarize
the new members with regulations, systems and trading practices. Subsequent to the Program and passing the member
examination (Series 15), a new member is required to wear a temporary badge (called on the Exchange today an ``orange
badge'') for a minimum of two weeks, during which time the new member may execute orders only under the direct supervision
of another experienced member.

According to the NYSE, a new member may execute an order under the direct supervision of any fully qualified NYSE member
who is a disinterested third party to the transaction. The experienced member observes the trade, and reviews it for
compliance with the relevant Exchange rules and trading practices. This review is evidenced by placing the experienced
member's badge number on the back of the order ticket. See Amendment No. 1,

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose for the proposed rule change is to facilitate the Exchange's ability to ensure compliance with all aspects
of the above-named policy. New members would be informed that, if they are found to have executed an order during the
initial two-week period not under an experienced member's supervision, the requirement to wear the temporary badge
and have their executions observed by an experienced member would be extended for an additional week. A second violation
of the policy would result in a possible fine under the provisions of Rule 476A.

The Exchange has clarified that, because the initial violation of this policy would result in an extension of the probationary
period, the second violation would be subject to the first time fine provided by Rule 476A. See Amendment No. 1,

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes failure to comply with the requirements of this policy should be addressed with an appropriate
sanction and seeks Commission approval to add violations of these requirements to the Rule 476A List.

2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will advance the objectives of Section 6(b)(6) of the Act in that it will provide a procedure
whereby members and member organizations can be ``appropriately disciplined'' in those instances when a rule violation
is minor in nature, but a sanction more serious than a warning or cautionary letter is appropriate. The proposed rule
change provides a fair procedure for imposing such sanctions, in accordance with the requirements of Section 6(b)
(7) and 6(d) (1) of the Act.

On January 28, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>

<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>

amendments to SEC Rule 15c3&hyph;1 (``SEC Net Capital Rule'').

Amendment No. 1 to the proposal (1) added the phrase ``foreign currency option'' before ``participant organization''
in proposed Rule 703(a)(v), and (2) deleted the word ``tentative'' before the phrase ``net capital'' in proposed
Rule 703(c)(ii)(A). Amendment No. 1 also clarified that the proposed rule change does not alter the Exchange's current
net capital requirements applicable to Registered Options Traders (``ROTs''). See Letter from Gerald O'Connell,
Vice President, Market Surveillance, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Derivatives and Equity
Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 1, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). Amendment No.
2 requests accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. See Letter from Edith Hallahan, Special Counsel, Regulatory
Services, Phlx, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of
Market Regulation, Commission, dated March 11, 1994.

Pursuant to the amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, all specialists, except options market makers,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 who are currently exempt from the net capital requirements of Rule 703, will be subject to a minimum net capital requirement
of $100,000.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Exchange believes that these amendments require the deletion of Phlx Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and
(v). Currently, Rule 703(a) (iii), (iv), and (v) impose a minimum net liquid asset
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 requirement of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms which are
both equity and options specialists.

The Exchange also proposes to amend Rule 703 to require each member organization and participant organization, including
each ROT, to notify the Exchange if it fails to maintain the minimum net capital required by the SEC Net Capital Rule
or it fails to maintain liquid assets in accordance with Phlx Rule 703. Specifically, the Exchange is proposing to
add a new paragraph (v) to Phlx Rule 703(a) which would require a member organization or foreign currency option participant
organization to promptly notify the Exchange if it ceases to be in compliance with the SEC Net Capital Rule or Phlx Rule
703(a) (iii) or (iv) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, former sections (a)(vi) or (a)(vii)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the Phlx proposes to amend paragraph (c)(vi) of Rule 703 to add the requirement that a floor broker's clearing
agent guarantee orders entrusted on the floor with that floor broker, in addition to transactions and balances carried
in the account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5),
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 in that the proposal is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the amendments to the SEC Net
Capital Rule make all specialists, except options market makers, that previously were exempt from the SEC Net Capital
Rule under subparagraph (b)(1), subject to the rule. The amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule, therefore, will have
the following effects on Phlx specialists: instead of the current minimum net liquid assets requirements under Phlx
Rule 703(a) of $50,000 for equity specialists, $75,000 for options specialists, and $100,000 for firms that act as
both equity and options specialists, the SEC's minimum net capital requirement of $100,000 for dealer's would apply.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission finds that the proposal will conform Rule 703 to the SEC Net Capital Rule, as amended, and is therefore
consistent with the Act.

The Commission believes that the notification portion of the proposed rule change may prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest by providing the Exchange with the ability to respond
promptly to such notification, especially respecting options market makers. Currently, Commission Rule 17a&hyph;11
requires, among other things, prompt telegraphic notice to a broker-dealer's designated examining authority,
as well as the SEC, when a broker-dealer falls below its minimum net capital requirement pursuant to the SEC Net Capital
Rule. This rule does not apply to options market makers, because they are exempt from the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Exchange's
proposed notification provision would apply to all member organizations and participant organizations, including
options market makers. As a result, the Commission finds that the proposed notification provision is consistent
with the Act, in general, and with SEC Rule 17a&hyph;11, in particular.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission finds that the proposed requirement that a floor broker's clearing agent guarantee orders
entrusted on the floor with that floor broker may serve to protect investors and the public interest by promoting liquidity
and confidence in the credibility of floor broker orders, consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule
change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to ensure that the amendments to Rule 703 are in place prior to the April 1, 1994, effective date of the Commission's
amendments to the SEC Net Capital Rule. The Commission believes that by granting accelerated approval, the potential
for any confusion between the current net capital standards provided in Rule 703 and those that will apply on April
1, 1994, pursuant to the SEC Net Capital Rule, will be adequately minimized. Finally, the original proposal was published
for the full 21-day comment period and no comments were received, and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 are simply clarifications
of the original proposal. As a result, the Commission finds good cause for accelerating approval of the proposed rule
change and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 to the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment Nos. 1 and 2. Persons
making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Southern Pacific Lines (SP) seeks relief from the requirements of the Rules, Standard and Instructions, 49 CFR,
Part 236, &sect;236.307, to the extent that the carrier not be required to install indication locking for approximately
224 signal locations on the SP, the aspects of which are not controlled by line circuits so arranged that a single fault
will not permit a more favorable aspect than intended to be displayed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant's justification for relief is that the estimated cost of a program to achieve compliance is in excess
of $700,000 and would take several years to complete the required work.

Any interested party desiring to protest the granting of an application shall set forth specifically the grounds
upon which the protest is made, and contain a concise statement of the interest of the protestant in the proceeding.
The original and two copies of the protest shall be filed with the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh

copy of the protest shall be furnished to the applicant at the address listed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA expects to be able to determine these matters without oral hearing. However, if a specific request for an oral hearing
is accompanied by a showing that the party is unable to adequately present his or her position by written statements,
an application may be set for public hearing.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The inflation adjustment factor, nonconventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DATE>

DATES:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1993 inflation adjustment factor, nonconventional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source fuel credit, and reference price apply to qualified fuels sold during calendar year 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
INFLATION FACTOR:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The inflation adjustment factor for calendar year 1993 is 1.8918. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
CREDIT:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The nonconventional source fuel credit for calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1993 is $5.68 per barrel-of-oil equivalent of qualified fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
PRICE:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reference price for calendar year 1993 is $14.24. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the above reference price does not exceed $23.50 multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor, the phaseout
of credit provided for in section 29(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code does not occur for any qualified fuel based
on the above reference price.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department requests applications from intermediaries seeking to administer grant funds as described in the
body of this NOFA. An intermediary that applies to cover an area smaller than one State must seek to administer grants
in a jurisdiction covering at least one HUD area office. Intermediaries will receive funding, to be used as processing
fees, from a portion of the $45 million funding that is available for technical assistance grants to promote the ability
of residents of eligible low-income housing to participate meaningfully in the preservation process established
by the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA) and the Low-Income Housing Preservation and
Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA). The NOFA describes the technical assistance grants that will be made
available through intermediaries and the selection criteria that will be used for those grants; however, this is
not a request for applications for those direct technical assistance grants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Of the available funds, $13.5 million will be available for Resident Capacity Grants and $31.5 million will be available
for Predevelopment grants. Both of these grant categories are described in Appendix A of this NOFA. Dollar amounts
have been made available by State, utilizing the Department's estimates of preservation activity. Any additional
amounts made available from the termination of the September 3, 1992, NOFA, or by appropriation in future years, if
any, will be divided proportionately between the grant categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the body of this document is information concerning eligible intermediary applicants; the funding available
by State; HUD's processing of the intermediary applications; grant applicants eligible for technical assistance;
and the selection criteria for both the intermediary applicants and technical assistance grant applicants. Technical
assistance applicants should be aware that the determination of which regulatory requirements apply to an applicant's
purchase depends on the preservation program under which the owner has filed a Notice of Intent. Thus, applicants
must comply with 24 CFR part 248 and with either ELIHPA or LIHPRHA, as appropriate. (Applicants should note that part
248, as codified in the April 1, 1993, revision of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) was amended subsequently in
a rule published on July 13, 1993 (57 FR 3384), which reflects requirements of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992.)

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1993, the Department took the unusual step of publishing a draft Notice of Fund Availability (58 FR 37819),
specifically inviting public comments on the Department's proposed methodology for implementing the provisions
of section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992)
(1992 HCDA), which added sections 251&hyph;257 to the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, section 601 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), approved November 28,
1990) (LIHPRHA). The comment period expired on August 28, 1993. The Department received a total of 26 comments. Two
comments were from legal/advocacy organizations; eight were from low-income housing organizations that are involved
in development of and advocacy for affordable housing; nine were from tenant organizations; three were from community
development corporations; two were from community service organizations; one was from a local government agency;
and one was from an individual housing consultant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA implements sections 251, 252, 253, 255, 256, and 257 of LIHPRHA, as added by section 312 of the 1992 HCDA. This
NOFA does not implement section 254 of LIHPRHA, which will be implemented soon through a separate NOFA. Therefore,
the comments received on section 254 as a result of the draft NOFA published July 13, 1993, will not be addressed here,
but will be considered in that separate NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first section of this NOFA is a discussion of the public comments and modifications from the draft NOFA that were
made in response to the public comments and as a result of additional HUD consideration. The actual NOFA follows the
discussion of public comments and begins with the section designated ``II. Purpose and Substantive Description.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I. Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Direct Technical Assistance Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Resident Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed NOFA required each applicant for a technical assistance grant to notify the residents of the property
of the application. Seventeen commenters requested that this requirement be clarified or strengthened. Six commenters
requested that the notification be in writing, and be required to include a summary of the proposed plan for the property
including items on the development team, budget, and proposed tasks. The Department has adopted this recommendation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters requested that the notification advise that residents themselves can also apply for grant
funds and can endorse an eligible organization of their choice. Several others said this information should be given,
not by the applicant, but by the Department, possibly as part of current resident notification forms under 24 CFR part
248. The Department has decided to require, as part of the applicant's resident notification, a statement that residents
may themselves become eligible grantees. One commenter said the notice must have a name and contact number for the
intermediary and the applicant. The Department has implemented this requirement. The same commenter suggested
that intermediaries be required to supply a copy of the application with translations. The Department has decided
that this requirement would be too burdensome on the intermediary and too costly to the Department. In general, however,
translation expenses would be considered a reimbursable expense under the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters expressed concern that owners may thwart access to buildings to prevent distribution of notices
and/or resident meetings. Therefore, HUD should require managers to provide addresses of tenants to intermediaries,
and any costs to owners would be reimbursable. The Department agrees that this could be a problem in certain cases.
If the applicant is having difficulties getting access to the building, it may contact the administering intermediary,
who will have the authority to contact the owner for access to the property and the names and addresses of residents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve commenters requested, as part of resident notification, an advance notification of application submission
for technical assistance, followed by a tenant comment period. Many of these commenters also requested the inclusion
of a requirement that the applicants meet with the residents prior to application submission. The comments ranged
from requiring a 15-day notice prior to application submission, to a 30-day comment period following a resident meeting,
with a seven-day notification that the meeting itself will take place. One commenter said at least two resident meetings
should be required, one informational and one for tenant comment. One commenter suggested that the tenant comment
period could partially overlap with the administering intermediary's review of the application so there would be
less delay in grant awards. Another said that the general requirement to notify all residents could be too burdensome
in large projects, and when owners are not cooperative, the applicant could simply certify that a public meeting was
held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department seeks to maximize resident participation, where appropriate, without unduly delaying the grant
award process. Therefore, the Department will require written notification that a resident meeting will take place.
This notification shall include summary information on the grant proposal and an indication that the residents will
be able to comment on the grant proposal subsequent to the resident meeting. The meeting shall occur at least 14 days
prior to application submission and resident comments may be submitted to the intermediary and the applicant during
that 14-day period. If there are substantive objections by the residents, the applicant must provide a response to
the residents and to the intermediary before the grant can be awarded. If necessary, the applicant will meet again
with the residents to resolve issues. In any case, if a majority of residents are opposed to the application, the application
will be rejected.

2. Applicant Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven commenters were concerned with the requirement that, if the owner has not submitted a Notice of Intent to sell,
the applicant must have a binding commitment from the owner to sell to the applicant. Several suggested that a letter
of intent to sell should be adequate, others that a letter to work exclusively with the applicant should be sufficient.
The wording ``binding agreement to sell'' is statutory; however, the Department agrees that it would be impractical
to require a purchase and sale agreement before the applicant has become an eligible purchaser under the preservation
program and/or has become a sponsor with the capacity to purchase, own, and manage the property. Therefore, the Department
interprets the binding agreement to sell as an exclusive agreement to work with the applicant entity towards a sale
unless it subsequently becomes clear that the applicant is not moving towards that goal in a reasonable and timely
manner. If the owner seeks to work with another entity without the consent of the applicant, consultation with the
intermediary on what constitutes a timely manner would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters requested that HUD clarify what ``seeking to purchase with a majority of resident support'' means.
One suggested it should be clear that the intention of the applicant is to become an eligible purchaser in the first
six months of the sale period. Several thought applicants should be required to detail the method for securing support
and adhere to that method. One thought that to require a majority-supported preferred priority purchase in order
to receive later grant funds is not inconsistent with the statute. The application kit will require that each applicant
detail its method for securing resident support, and this will be reviewed by the intermediary in deciding whether
the plan to achieve a resident-supported purchase is reasonable and achievable. In general, applicants must adhere
to their grant plans to receive further funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters said documented resident opposition to a grantee should be sufficient to reject or terminate a grant;
four of these commenters also requested that resident withdrawal of support for a grantee stop all funding. Two commented
that HUD should be required to address the reasons for withdrawal of funding. One commented that residents should
be able to appeal the selection of a Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) applicant, and that termination
should be allowed for nonperformance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department reiterates that termination of a grant for nonperformance has always been the Department's practice.
The Department has included in the NOFA the provision that a majority of resident opposition to the applicant prior
to approval of an application would be sufficient for the intermediary to reject the application. In addition, a majority
of resident support for another eligible entity at any time would be sufficient for termination of the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that Resident Capacity grants should only be given to groups that will not seek to purchase and
recipients should be disqualified as a priority purchaser. Another, however, said that potential purchasers should
not be categorically prohibited from receiving Resident Capacity grant funds. One commenter said the NOFA should
maintain the Resident Capacity-applicant concept that RCs, Resident Groups and Community-Based Nonprofit Housing
Developers (CBDs) are equally eligible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the statute is clear on eligibility in this case. Nonprofit community-based housing
developers may receive Resident Capacity grants in order to educate and organize the residents and resident organizations.
However, in the case of competing applications for Resident Capacity grants, the intermediaries will give preference
to resident groups and resident organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter said that grantees should be required to demonstrate fiscal standards or to use grant funds to establish
them. The Department has included this requirement in previous grant programs and will continue to include the requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters suggested that the threshold for resident membership in resident groups should be raised to 10% of
the units. One suggested that all recipients should have this support. Another suggested that a committee structure
that involves residents by building or floor should be required. Another commenter, however, felt that the proposed
NOFA set a realistically low threshold for demonstrating resident support at an early stage and that, instead, the
requirement should be for ongoing progress toward gaining greater resident support. The Department has not increased
the minimum unit threshold, but will, through its guidance to intermediaries, require direct assistance grantees
to show continued effort towards gaining resident support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that resident groups that are not yet Resident Councils should not be able to apply for Resident
Capacity grants. Again, the statute is clear on this point_resident groups are eligible for these grants. Two commenters
felt that Resident Capacity grant applicants should be required to identify persons carrying out activities and
their qualifications. The Department has clarified this in the NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that joint venture applications should be permitted from any eligible applicants. The Department
has clarified this in the NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters wanted clarification that a Notice of Election to Proceed under the provision of section 604 of LIHPRHA
(Form 9610) should count as a Notice of Intent for purposes of eligibility. The Department has made this clarification.
Two others suggested that the Form 9610 should make a property eligible regardless of whether or not the owner is currently
proceeding under the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will not allow applications in properties when the owner is not proceeding under the program at this
time. A Form 9610 will count as a Notice of Intent under this NOFA only if the owner has checked box B on that form and is
proceeding under the program. Not many owners have submitted a Form 9610 electing to proceed through the LIHPRHA appraisal
process, but have not subsequently submitted a Notice to the Department indicating their intent to proceed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters suggested expanding the definition of eligible applicants. One suggested including Community
Action Agencies, which have been servicing the low-income community in all areas for more than 25 years, and Community-Based
Nonprofit Organizations. One felt Statewide organizations should be eligible for Resident Capacity grants. The
third suggested that where there is no existing CBD (in rural or underserved areas), a new CBO should be able to align
itself with an existing nonprofit that has two years of experience. Again, the Department believes the statute is
clear: these are not eligible applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter sought clarification that if the owner is not selling, residents can receive a Resident Capacity grant.
Two commenters sought further clarification that resident capacity grants are separate from Predevelopment grants
and can be awarded concurrently and to separate organizations. The Department has made both of these clarifications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter felt the word ``community'' was vaguely defined in the NOFA, and that even if an organization has not
been active throughout its entire region for some time, the organization should not be precluded from applying for
a grant. The Department has repeated the statutory requirement in this case, and believes it is clear.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested that HOPE 2 grantees not be required to wait for notification of termination of HOPE 2 grant
before applying for a technical assistance (resident capacity or predevelopment) grant because there might be HUD
delays. Because an owner cannot file a Notice of Intent (NOI) until HOPE 2 is terminated, the criterion for previous
HOPE selectees should be an owner's filing of a NOI. The Department has adopted this suggestion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that existing owner/sellers (including nonprofits) should not be able to apply for Resident
Capacity grants. In general, this is the Department's requirement, with the exception of nonprofit general partners
seeking to buy out their limited partners. Substantive objections from residents in the case of an application from
a nonprofit general partner, however, will be considered by intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned that grantees under the 1992 NOFA may not be eligible to apply for additional funds under
this NOFA because they are not Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers. The Department considers the statute
clear and finds no reason to change the statutory requirement or the NOFA. Community-Based Nonprofit Organizations
funded under the previous NOFA are not necessarily eligible under this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Eligible Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven commenters sought clarification on eligible activities for Resident Capacity grants. Suggestions for additional
eligible activities included: providing training on rights and opportunities under LIHPRHA; training on resident
issues if an owner is not selling; hiring architect or other consultants to advise residents during the Preservation
Capital Needs Assessment (PCNA)/appraisal process; hiring a tenant coordinator or a project manager; expense to
cover phone and copying; and legal services to interpret preservation documentation. The Department has made these
clarifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters sought clarification on eligible activities for Predevelopment grants. Suggestions for additional
eligible activities included: obtaining a financial feasibility analysis; preparing a Plan of Action or Resident
Homeownership Plan; preparing a Transfer of Physical Assets package; tenant and board training on ``development''
and the preservation process; legal expenses; and hiring a project manager. The Department has made these clarifications.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six commenters felt tenant-related expenses, such as child care, bus fare to meetings, and beverages at meetings,
should be allowable. The Department has made this clarification. However these expenses are only allowable to the
extent that they support residents in their ability to participate in resident meetings and in planning for the grant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggested that newly formed resident groups should be required to ensure a democratic process developed
in conjunction with the National Alliance of HUD Tenants, that residents should have oversight authority over recipients,
and that tenant input should be a criterion in receiving additional funds. The Department decided that a requirement
to work with a specific national organization would be too burdensome on the grantees. The Department is clarifying
that residents should be notified of the progress of the grant, but requiring resident oversight will be too burdensome
on the grantee and the intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that HUD consider the administrative structure necessary for providing the grants, given
that the nonprofit grantees may not end up being purchasers/sponsors. The Department considered this issue and believes
the statutory intent is clear. The creation of an eligible Community-Based Nonprofit Organization (CBO) purchaser
is a requirement of a Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer (CBD) seeking a grant to purchase a property under
LIHPRHA. The Department will work with intermediaries to ensure that grant fund release is not delayed due to the creation
of a new entity. Funds for activities subsequent to a purchase offer may be released to the new entity. However, that
new entity is expected to continue working with the Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developer through the term
of the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter suggested that the requirement that grantees be in conformance with appropriate program regulations
and guidelines is too burdensome on grantees and, rather, should be a requirement of HUD or intermediaries as part
of monitoring. The Department believes this requirement is not too burdensome. A grantee may use the grant to fund
administrative activities in order to conform with the grant and the preservation programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters felt HUD should spell out a clear priority to maximize grant funds to tenant-controlled coalitions.
Two others requested a requirement that all grantees obtain tenant group approval, to ensure maximum tenant control
over the eventual purchaser. While the Department has clarified that resident organizations have preference for
Resident Capacity grants, the Department believes that the other priorities listed by the commenters are contrary
to statutory intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Conflicts of Interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received six comments on the proposed NOFA's conflict of interest requirements. One commenter believed
that the requirements should be stronger. Another felt the requirement should involve disclosure rather than strict
guidelines, so groups could continue to work with current consultants. Three commenters believed that the conflict
of interest requirements should require grant recipients to certify that there is no violation of the Related Party
rule, as defined in 24 CFR 248.101. Further, to prevent ``straw'' buyers, the Related Party Rule should: apply to entities
other than individuals (e.g., corporations and partnerships); prohibit an identity of interest with a for-profit
owner; not prohibit use of consultants and attorneys who are arms length; and require all related parties to make disclosures.
One commenter felt the applicant should also disclose any intent to be involved in management, development, or provision
of services for money, but that continued use of architects, management agents, development consultants, etc.,
should not be prohibited after acquisition. Another felt there should not be a blanket prohibition on a grantee contracting
with owner consultants, as long as full disclosure is made and residents, through these disclosures, are able to have
a say in personnel decisions. One commenter suggested a requirement that the applicant submit: Forms 2530 for the
applicant and all board members; articles of incorporation; statements of officers and directors; financial statements
for the last five years; and a listing of properties owned and operated in the last ten years. This commenter felt that
conflicts with current management as well as the owner should be disclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has decided to tighten the proposed NOFA's conflict of interest requirements. The required certification
will state that there has been no conflict of interest relationship during the previous five years, and it will include
a requirement that the applicant not seek any financial benefit from project ownership. The Department has further
clarified that nonprofit general partners seeking to buy out their limited partners are exempt from this rule. In
addition, the NOFA will require disclosure to tenants and to the intermediary to include any relationship with owners,
management, or any other parties to the sale. The Department will also require certification by the applicant that
it will not interfere with the tenants' right to organize.

5. Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters requested that the Department allow funding for activities conducted prior to grant award. Two of
these specifically made this suggestion to prevent lack of assistance where there are delays in funding that are not
the fault of the grantee_suggesting funding of activities beginning at the earlier of award approval or 30 days after
application submission, which is the date by which funds should have been awarded. One suggestion was to allow funding
for activities conducted prior to the grant award and after NOI submission because this would be consistent with other
HUD programs_specifically the Department's Section 202 (12 U.S.C. 1701q) program. Under the Section 202 program,
previous expenses must be fully documented and fall within application budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has decided to allow reimbursement of funds back to the time when the applicant became eligible for
grant funds. For Resident Capacity grants this will be the time the owner files any Notice of Intent to Proceed. For
Predevelopment grants this will be the time the owner has indicated an intent to sell the property. This decision was
based in part on the increased resident notification period, which will inherently delay the time which grant funds
are awarded and received by the recipient. While grantees may be reimbursed for eligible activities, they undertake
these activities at their own risk. If a grant is not subsequently awarded, there will be no mechanism for compensating
the applicant. To qualify for reimbursement, activities performed prior to the grant award must be eligible activities
under the NOFA and must be clearly identified in the application submission package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that residents be informed when grant is awarded. The Department has adopted this requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has rejected a suggestion that the grants be competitive with quarterly awards, rather than ongoing
awards, in order to give residents more time to get applications and formally comment. The statute allows applications
on a rolling basis, and requiring a grantee to wait several months for an award could hinder a resident-supported purchase
for the property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned that $200,000 would not be enough to cover predevelopment costs for most projects. This
funding limit is statutory, and the Department has no discretion to alter the limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters sought clarification on what terminating the current grant program means. In order to ensure continuity
of the program, they suggest that: awardees under the September 3, 1992, NOFA should be able to apply for new funds as
soon as old funds are obligated; grantees should not be able to receive grants over the total of this NOFA; and, because
it is an ongoing process, grantees should not be required to expend all funds awarded in the 1992 NOFA. In this NOFA the
Department is allowing applications from grantees with active grants under the September 3, 1992, NOFA; however,
as awards are made by the intermediary, the previous awards shall be terminated. It is impractical for grantees to
report to both the HUD field office and the intermediary on ongoing grant status. The total grant award from both NOFAs
must not be greater than the total allowed in this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were ten comments on the Department's method for funding technical assistance grants on a State-by-State basis.
One concern was that basing fund allocation solely on active Notices of Intent, plus active Plans of Action, will be
skewed, because this does not directly correlate with preservation sales activity. The Department should not include
cases where owners have not yet indicated an intention to sell; rather, funding for predevelopment grants should
be tied to the number of NOIs to sell plus binding sales commitments. Another suggested that the same allocation formula
should not be used for both Resident Capacity and Predevelopment grants. Several commented that the formula should
remain flexible to reflect actual activity levels in States, and suggested a hold-back so that funds could be reallocated
according to actual participation levels. Several others suggested a reallocation method between States. The Department
seriously considered using only Notices of Intent to Sell as the criteria for a State breakdown of funding. The Department
cannot use binding commitments as an indicator, because it will not have these in advance of the State-by-State allocation.
However, experience from the September 3, 1992, NOFA shows that an owner's Initial Notice of Intent is only a partial
indication of what an owner will actually do. Therefore, the Department will not change its method for allocation
by State. The Department has also decided not to maintain a holdback, but will reallocate funds between intermediaries
if levels of grant activity justify a reallocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requested HUD to allocate unused funds from the 1992 NOFA using the 90/10 formula in the statute, rather
than giving all unused funds to technical assistance grants. The Department has decided to allocate unused funds
using the 90/10 formula. Another commenter sought clarification of the exact amount of funds available from 1992
NOFA and how these funds will be divided. Because the 1992 NOFA is active, and will be for several months, the Department
cannot know exactly how much will be available once the 1992 NOFA is terminated.

6. Applicant Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters felt that the application review should include review of the financial viability of the property
and an analysis of the development team, rather than a simple review of the applicant itself. One commenter was concerned
that resident support would override strong underwriting criteria. The Department has chosen not to amend this selection
criteria, but will also instruct intermediaries reviewing Predevelopment grant applications to conduct a review
on the feasibility of the purchase, including a review of the development team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that if any award is made by an intermediary or HUD, the procurement requirements of OMB Circular
A&hyph;110 should be deemed to have been met. This would permit continuity of service for consultants who were identified
by grantees prior to the availability of Federal funds. The Department finds it unnecessary to address this in the
NOFA. However, if the organization is currently meeting the OMB requirements, the Department anticipates that the
organization will continue to do so under another grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter pointed out that the NOFA says grants are awarded within 30 days, and that this should be specified as 30
calendar days. Another commenter requested that the NOFA specify the appeals process to HUD. The Department has adopted
both of these suggestions in this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters recommended requiring intermediaries to explain why an application was not funded or why items
within an application were not funded. The Department has adopted this recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that applicant resident groups should be able to request the intermediary to provide expertise
and assistance in grant activities. Because the Department does not wish to have intermediaries performing activities
inconsistently across the country, it has not made this a requirement of intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eleven comments were received regarding the NOFA's guidance on competing applications. One area of concern was the
time by which another application could be received. Several commenters suggested allowing an applicant 30 days
to gain support, others suggested 20 days, another 14 days. Several commenters also suggested giving the intermediary
additional review time should two applications be received. Several commenters felt the intermediary should attempt
to resolve the situation or require that competing applicants meet and attempt to come to a resolution. Three commenters
suggested that in the case of dual applicants, a clear priority should be for resident groups and resident councils
over Community-Based Nonprofit Housing Developers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has decided if a second application is received within 30 days of receipt of the first application,
the intermediary will have an additional 20 days to complete the review of both. If the applications are for a Resident
Capacity grant, the intermediary will give funding preference to a resident group or a Resident Council over another
applicant. If there are competing Predevelopment grant applicants and both are otherwise acceptable, the intermediary
will send back the applications and give applicants an opportunity to meet, explain differences to tenants, and come
to a resolution/compromise. If no compromise is reached the intermediary would fund the applicant that it found most
capable of performing grant and nonprofit sponsor activities. The fact that a nonprofit developer is receiving a
Predevelopment grant would not preclude a separate resident group from getting a Resident Capacity grant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Fee Structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twelve commenters were concerned that the proposed fee structure for intermediaries would not yield sufficient
funds to cover the scope of services listed in the NOFA. The proposed NOFA contemplated a $5,000 start-up fee, plus
2 percent of the grant awards for the State or States in which the intermediary administered grants. Suggestions ranged
from 4 to 5 percent of the grant awards. One commenter suggested that the minimum start-up fee should be $15,000 so smaller
States will participate. Several others suggested that the fee should vary according to the level of activities that
the intermediary is performing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department considered seriously the appropriateness of the fee and awarding a different level of funding to intermediaries
performing a higher level of activities. The Department has chosen a processing fee structure through which each
intermediary will receive a $15,000 start-up fee and five percent of each technical assistance grant it administers,
which will be allocated as the grants are disbursed. Each intermediary will also receive a flat fee of $500 for each
grant application rejected. If a selected intermediary receives no grant applications, it will receive only the
start-up fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Intermediary Selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At least one commenter felt that the Department should give preference to local intermediaries, then State and regional
intermediaries, over national intermediaries. The Department has decided to allow sub-State intermediaries in
areas where there appears to be enough preservation activity to justify a sub-State intermediary. However, any sub-State
intermediary must apply to administer grants in a geographic area covering at least one HUD area office. In most States,
any economies of scale would be lost if there was more than one intermediary. In its review of intermediaries the Department
will review and rate all local intermediaries before reviewing State and regional intermediaries. However, the
Department will consider the capacity, experience, and point scores of all local, State and regional intermediaries
before making final intermediary selection. National intermediaries will be chosen for those areas for which no
other acceptable intermediary has applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern from eleven commenters lead to suggestions that outside parties, particularly resident groups, should
be able to comment on the applications and selections of intermediaries. Because the selection of intermediary grantees
is competitive, the disclosure of grant applications would be in violation of section 12 of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537a), and, therefore, the Department cannot implement this suggestion.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that intermediaries be required to state in their proposals how they will deal with the problem
of monitoring unincorporated entities to ensure that they act with proper fiscal standards. The same commenter agreed
with the Department's preference for an intermediary handling both Resident Capacity and Predevelopment grants.
As part of its overall evaluation of each intermediary's application, the Department will evaluate proposals to
deal with the problem of monitoring fiscal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that Community Action Agencies, which have been the leader in services to the low-income
community in all areas for more than 25 years, be eligible intermediaries. The Department is adhering to the statutory
definition of intermediary, but to the extent such an agency has the capacity to become an eligible applicant under
the guidelines, a Community Action Agency could apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that intermediaries receive preference if they have a structured plan that maximizes
resident participation in administrative policy issues. Another commenter requested that HUD require intermediaries
to work with a tenant-based coalition, and if an intermediary cannot develop this support, HUD should administer
the grants. The Department will not include this requirement because it would be too burdensome, particularly for
national intermediaries. However, four commenters suggested giving preference to intermediaries with demonstrated
resident/nonprofit accountability. The Department will give preference for such a demonstrated track record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended deleting language that requires intermediaries to have a record of service in ``multiple
communities'' because the language is vague and confusing. The requirement is statutory and therefore the language
remains unchanged. The Department does not agree that it is confusing. The Department considers ``a record of service&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
in multiple communities'' to mean the intermediary has worked with various types of organizations within varied
communities. Preferably these communities would include a cross-section of the geographic area for which the intermediary
is applying to administer grants. The definition would exclude an intermediary that has worked solely in one community
or neighborhood.

3. Intermediary Tasks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven commenters requested more detail in the NOFA of the Department's expectations to guide intermediaries, particularly
in their monitoring activities, with standards and timeframes. Several sought clarification of the legal responsibilities
of the intermediaries, others felt intermediary activities should be expanded and negotiated with HUD to include
underwriting, monitoring, servicing, site visits, and technical assistance provision. One commenter sought clarification
of whether an intermediary will act as a delegated processor with final grant authority, or whether it will function
under some other model. One commenter disagreed with negotiating the level of activities, arguing that HUD should
require specific tasks of all intermediaries to get all essential tasks covered. The Department has seriously considered
this issue and has provided a greater level of detail of its expectations of the intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will not allow a variety of participation levels by intermediaries. However, if an intermediary seeks
to perform a higher level of activities, such as technical assistance, it may apply to perform these activities under
a separate HUD NOFA that will implement section 254 of LIHPRHA as added by section 312 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992. That NOFA is expected to be published soon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that intermediaries, in general, should not have say over who is selected as a priority purchaser,
which consultants are hired, what are the contract terms, etc. While the Department's regulations regarding priority
purchasers are separate from this NOFA, the intermediaries will have review authority over consultants hired and
terms of contracts under the technical assistance grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that some technical assistance grantees may want closer oversight and assistance, and intermediaries
should be required to provide to those grantees what is agreed upon in the grant. As discussed above, and in order to
provide consistency nationwide, the grantees cannot request a higher level of service from the intermediaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Accountability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters suggested that resident groups should be able to formally monitor intermediaries prior to their
receipt of further funding, and to include standards that encourage intermediaries to have accountability to residents
and nonprofits without micromanagement by the intermediary. One of these commenters suggested that intermediaries
should show evidence of a commitment to tenant organizing; another suggested a stronger conflict of interest proviso
and performance benchmarks for the intermediary. However, a fourth commenter believed oversight of intermediaries
should not be by tenant groups or other prospective grantees; rather, HUD should provide this oversight. This commenter
recommended a selection of intermediaries when the track record indicates absence of abuse. As part of its monitoring
of intermediaries, the Department will accept comments from outside parties on intermediary performance after
intermediary grants are in place and active. However, the Department does not find it appropriate to include, nor
does it desire to delay intermediary funding by including, resident groups directly in the monitoring process.

5. Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter recommended that the benchmarks for Technical Assistance Grantees be made by the Department, rather
than left up to the intermediary. The statute requires that HUD work with intermediaries to come up with the performance
benchmarks for the Predevelopment Grant phases. The Department intends these benchmarks to be consistent across
the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested clarification that intermediaries, at their own risk, may incur costs from the date they
are selected, as opposed to the date of contract execution. The Department agrees with this request; however, no actual
fees will be paid prior to the date of contract execution and the intermediary may not begin funding technical assistance
grantees prior to such execution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Authority and Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding made available under this NOFA is authorized by section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act
of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) in order to provide assistance to resident groups and Community-Based
Nonprofit Housing Developers (CBDs) involved in projects proceeding under the provisions of the Emergency Low-Income
Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (Pub. L.100&hyph;242, section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Act
of 1987, approved Feb. 5, 1988) (ELIHPA) or the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of
1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, section 601 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), approved November 28, 1990)
(LIHPRHA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The origins of LIHPRHA are in ELIHPA. The purpose of ELIHPA was to preserve low-income affordability restrictions
on certain HUD-insured or assisted multifamily projects. ELIHPA authorized the use of incentives to encourage owners
to retain low-income affordability restrictions or to transfer the property to purchasers who would agree to retain
those restrictions. The fundamental principles underlying ELIHPA were that the low-income housing should be preserved
for the intended beneficiaries and that owners should be guaranteed a fair and reasonable return on their investments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ELIHPA was intended to be a temporary measure that would allow Congress time to fashion a permanent program for the
preservation of existing low-income housing projects. This permanent program is LIHPRHA, which replaced ELIHPA
except to the extent that section 604 of NAHA provides a transition option for certain owners. In addition, section
226 of LIHPRHA establishes the Resident Homeownership Program, under which tenants may become homeowners of eligible
low income housing. The Department's regulations implementing these statutory provisions are set out in 24 CFR part
248. (Applicants should note that part 248, as codified in the April 1, 1993, revision of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) was amended subsequently in a rule published on July 13, 1993 (57 FR 3384). Most requirements under this NOFA
were imposed by title III of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 and are included in the July 13, 1993,
amendments to part 248.)

B. Request for Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible intermediaries are invited to apply to administer funds under the provisions of this NOFA (see Section V.A,
``Obtaining Intermediary Applications'' of this NOFA). The Department will announce the selected intermediaries
and will publish the addresses of the intermediaries and the date on which applicants may apply to intermediaries
for technical assistance grant funds. Selected intermediaries will also announce the availability of technical
assistance grant funds as described in Section III of this NOFA.

C. Allocation and Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this NOFA is to make available $45 million in funds to and through intermediaries for eligible resident
and community organizations. The dollar amounts will be made available on a State-by-State basis for two types of
grants: Resident Capacity grants and Predevelopment grants. The description of how funds will initially be divided
by State is listed in Appendix B of this NOFA. The Department will rate local intermediaries, then State intermediaries,
then regional intermediaries before making selections for each geographic area. Some States may be subdivided for
purposes of the NOFA activities if there are a sufficient number of eligible low-income housing projects in the State
to justify sub-State intermediaries. Local or sub-State intermediaries applying to perform grant administration
activities must apply to perform activities covering at least the jurisdiction of one HUD area office. The Department
will generally favor local or sub-State intermediaries over State intermediaries, and will favor State intermediaries
over regional intermediaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, before making the final intermediary selections, the Department will assess the overall capacity and experience
of intermediary applicants. If no intermediary applicant applies to administer grants in a particular State or area,
the Department will select a national intermediary to perform those activities in that State or area. If no acceptable
application is received from a national intermediary, the Department's field offices will administer the Resident
Capacity and Predevelopment grants for all areas not covered by local, State, or regional intermediaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Preservation Technical Assistance Grant program that is currently being administered by the Department, in
accordance with a NOFA published on September 3, 1992, at 57 FR 40570 (as amended at 57 FR 56929 (December 1, 1992) and
58 FR 8766 (February 17, 1993)), will be terminated at intermediary selection. A portion of the unreserved funds from
that earlier NOFA will be made available under this NOFA through the intermediaries. Grantees active under the September
3, 1992, NOFA will continue under that grant program unless they apply for and receive funds under this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two forms of technical assistance grants that will be made available through intermediaries are Resident Capacity
grants and Predevelopment grants. These are described in Appendix A to this NOFA. Of the $45 million available from
FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations, $13.5 million is available for Resident Capacity grants and $31.5 million is available
for Predevelopment grants. Of any additional funds made available under this program, 30 percent will be set aside
for Resident Capacity grants and 70 percent for Predevelopment grants. The dollar amounts available to the individual
resident and community organizations shall be limited to $30,000 for Resident Capacity grants and $200,000 for Predevelopment
grants. The Predevelopment grants will be funded in at least two phases. The performance benchmarks for these phases
will be negotiated between the Department and selected intermediaries prior to technical assistance application
submission.

General Definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
An eligible intermediary applicant is a local, State, regional, or national nonprofit or quasi-public organization
or a State or local housing agency that has as a central purpose of its organization the preservation of low-income
housing and the prevention of displacement of low- and moderate-income residents. An eligible intermediary must
not receive direct Federal appropriations for operating support. All intermediaries must have a record of service
to low-income individuals or community-based nonprofit housing developers in multiple communities, and must meet
the standards of fiscal responsibilities established in OMB Circulars A&hyph;110 and A&hyph;122 or, if a State or
local agency, 24 CFR 85 and OMB Circular 87. In addition, intermediaries must have experience with the allocation
or administration of grant or loan funds. (Copies of OMB circulars are available from E.O.P. Publications, room 2200,
New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) 395&hyph;7332. (This is not a toll-free number.)

B. Fees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each selected intermediary will receive processing fees. The fees will include a start-up fee of $15,000 and an additional
fee of five percent of each technical assistance grant the intermediary administers, which will be allocated as the
grants are disbursed. These fees are based on the intermediary performing the following activities: Announcing
the availability of grant funds; producing and distributing application kits; accepting, reviewing and approving
and/or rejecting grant applications; executing grant agreements; disbursing grant funds; monitoring the grantees'
activities under the grant award; monitoring compliance with the grant agreement through the term of the grant; and
maintaining documentation of grant activities for the Department's monitoring of the intermediary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Intermediaries will be legally responsible to the Department for approving eligible applicants, activities, and
budgets, and shall maintain all correspondence with and documentation regarding the technical assistance grantees
for not less than five years. All intermediaries will receive the start-up fee when the intermediary contract is executed.
Intermediaries will draw down five percent of each technical assistance grant award at the time those awards are disbursed,
not to exceed five percent of the total funds available to the jurisdiction. If an intermediary reviews and rejects
a technical assistance application, it will receive an administrative fee of $500. If an intermediary receives no
technical assistance grant applications, it will receive only its start-up fee. On occasion, the Department will
review grant activity to determine if reallocation of funds between geographic regions is necessary.

C. Eligible Tasks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediaries may apply for one or both parts of the intermediary tasks described in this NOFA. The two distinct tasks
are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Administering Resident Capacity grants; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Administering predevelopment grants. Through its application, an intermediary must describe the specific
jurisdiction in which it proposes to perform such tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There will be no duplication of geographic coverage for any administrative task. In States where there is sufficient
preservation activity to justify sub-State intermediaries, State or regional intermediaries may apply to perform
activities in areas that include the jurisdiction of one or more HUD field offices. In no case will a field office jurisdiction
be subdivided for purposes of intermediary selection for grant administration. To assure maximum geographic coverage
by intermediaries, HUD may negotiate geographic coverage with intermediaries as part of intermediary selection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific tasks for all intermediaries will include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Advertising fund availability for the jurisdiction overseen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Producing and distributing grant application kits. (A sample kit will be provided by the Department.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Accepting grant applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reviewing and approving or rejecting grant applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Executing grant agreements. (A draft grant agreement will be provided by the Department.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Vouchering for funds through the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disbursing grant funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Monitoring activities under the grant, including compliance under the grant agreement, throughout the term
of the grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Reporting to the Department at least quarterly on the status of applications, grant awards, grantee activities,
and funds expended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Maintaining grant documentation for HUD monitoring and audits.

D. Ineligible Intermediary Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediaries may not receive payment, directly or indirectly, from the proceeds of grants they have approved.
In addition, intermediaries may not provide other services to grant recipients with respect to the specific properties
for which the grant has been awarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Selection Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediaries must meet minimum criteria described in Section III.A, ``Eligible Intermediaries,'' of this NOFA.
If in its review the Department determines that the applicant does not meet the threshold criteria, the application
will be rejected. If the application does meet the threshold criteria, then the Department will select intermediaries
through a rating and ranking competition described in Section III.E(2) of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Preferences and Factors for Award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intermediary applications will be rated and ranked on a point system, with the maximum point score of 100. The Department
will first rate and rank any local or sub-State intermediary applications, then all State intermediary applications,
and then regional applications. In general, the Department will give preference to local intermediaries, as discussed
in Section II.C, ``Allocation and Funding'', of this NOFA; however, capacity, experience, and overall points for
these intermediaries will be considered before selection. The Department may establish a threshold score on capacity
and experience that local applicants must meet in order to qualify for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After selecting local, State, and regional intermediaries, the Department will rate and rank all national intermediary
applications to select an intermediary in States or regions for which no other eligible intermediary, acceptable
to the Secretary, has submitted a proposal to participate. If no such national intermediary applies to perform NOFA
activities, the Department, through its field offices, will administer technical assistance grant funds for all
areas without an acceptable intermediary. The Department will consider joint venture applications as long as one
eligible intermediary is identified in the application as the primary applicant. The rating points will be allocated
based on the categories below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preservation Experience.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (30 points) The Secretary shall give rating points to applications from eligible intermediaries based on expertise
or experience with ELIHPA and LIHPRHA. Maximum points will be given to applicants with significant demonstrated
expertise or experience with ELIHPA or LIHPRHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Range of Activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (10 points) These points will be given to organizations applying to administer both the Resident Capacity grants
and the Predevelopment grants, rather than applying to administer just one of those grant programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct Experience.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (30 points) Rating points will be given to intermediaries based on their direct experience in performing the tasks
for which they have applied. This would include administration of grants to resident organizations, administration
of grants to nonprofit organizations and State or local agencies, and monitoring of nonprofit grantees. The Department
will not assign preference to intermediaries with experience in administering Federal grants, but may exclude applicants
that have failed to perform under prior contracts of a similar nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Organizational Capacity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (30 points) Each applicant will be rated on its organizational capacity to implement its plan to administer grants.
Each applicant should submit evidence that its organization can implement the proposed activities in an efficient
manner, based on demonstrated organizational capacity and staff expertise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Responsibilities of Intermediaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Intermediaries will be responsible for performing the tasks listed in Section III.C, ``Eligible Tasks,'' of this
NOFA. The technical assistance grant program that the intermediaries will be administering is described in detail
in Appendix A to this NOFA.

B. Timeframes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Once funding availability is advertised by the intermediary for its jurisdiction, technical assistance applications
will be submitted to the intermediaries on an ongoing basis. If the applications are acceptable, grants must be awarded
no later than 30 calendar days after a complete application is received by the intermediary. If the application is
found to be substantially complete (i.e., there are no missing exhibits), but technically deficient (i.e., an exhibit
does not adequately meet the application requirements), the intermediary shall send the applicant a deficiency
letter and allow 14 days for resubmission of deficient exhibits. The intermediary will have an additional 30 days
to review and approve an application, following receipt of application revisions. If the application is not substantially
complete, it will be rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

realistic and within the time frames set forth in the applicable program regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Predevelopment Grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All Predevelopment grant applicants will receive an application kit that will have been produced and distributed
by the intermediary. A sample application kit will be provided to the intermediaries from the Department. Applications
will be accepted on an ongoing basis, and all acceptable applications will be approved unless there are no funds available
for Predevelopment grants. Intermediaries must review and approve or reject applications for Predevelopment grants
based on the following threshold criteria: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The applicant meets the eligible applicant criteria listed in paragraph A of Appendix A to this NOFA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and in conformance with the appropriate program regulations and guidelines. This will include an evaluation of the
experience and capacity of the applicant's development team; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The budget submitted with the application reflects reasonable costs directly associated with the grant activities
that would result in the development of a feasible purchase; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The estimate of time necessary to achieve completion of activities and delivery of products is reasonable and
realistic and within the time frames set forth in the applicable program regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Competing Grant Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a second technical assistance application is received within 30 days of receipt of the first application for any
property, and if that application is for the same grant category, the intermediary shall have an additional 20 days
to review both applications. The total review time for any grant cannot exceed 50 days. If the competing applications
are for Resident Capacity grants, resident groups and Resident Councils shall have priority over other applicants.
If the competing applications are for Predevelopment grants, and both are found technically acceptable, the Intermediary
will return the applications with instructions that the applicants meet together and with the residents to reach
a resolution for a final application. If no compromise is reached, the intermediary will approve the applicant that
the intermediary finds most capable of performing grant and nonprofit sponsor activities. In addition, in the case
of any application, if there is an indication that a majority of the residents oppose the applicant's selection, that
application shall be denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Decision Not To Fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In any denial of award letter, the intermediary shall be required to explain the reasons for its determination. In
addition, if the intermediary makes a determination that results in a reduction of proposed grant funds, that determination
shall also be explained in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Intermediary Selection Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The selection process for intermediaries consists of a threshold screening to determine whether the application
meets the technical requirements for application submission contained in this NOFA and the application kit. If the
application meets the technical requirements, it will be reviewed and ranked by the Preservation Division in HUD
Headquarters according to the selection criteria in Section III.E of this NOFA. Within 60 days from the application
deadline, the Preservation Division will notify an intermediary of its selection or rejection. Selected intermediaries
will be required to sign a grant agreement. If no intermediary is selected for a particular State, the HUD field offices
will administer the grants directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Corrections to Deficient Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an application submitted by an intermediary is found to be deficient in a nonsubstantive manner, the Department
will inform the applicant of such deficiency within 15 days after the application deadline and the applicant will
have seven days to submit revisions to its application. Nonsubstantive deficiencies are those that are not integral
to the application's review, such as a certification. If an application is substantively deficient at the time of
application deadline, the application will be rejected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will complete its review and selection process within 60 days of the deadline date for intermediaries.
Once intermediaries are selected and agreements are executed, intermediaries will have 30 days to make grant funds
available to eligible technical assistance applicants. Grants from technical assistance applicants will be accepted
on a rolling basis by the intermediaries administering such grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Intermediary Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the list of selected Intermediaries within 30 days of the date that the Department's intermediary selection process
is completed. That publication will include information for potential technical assistance applicants on how to
obtain application kits and will list contact names at the Intermediary organizations selected to administer the
grants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(b) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this notice relate only to technical assistance and, therefore,
are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Federalism Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically,
the funds available under this NOFA will be used to select intermediaries that will administer technical assistance
grants to eligible recipients. The grants to eligible recipients will be for technical assistance activities related
to the preservation of low-income housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Family Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
notice does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,
and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. No significant change in existing HUD policies or programs will
result from promulgation of this notice, as those policies and programs relate to family concerns.

HUD's regulation (24 CFR part 4) implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3537a) (Reform Act) applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of
the rule continue to apply until the announcement of selection of successful applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both HUD and intermediary employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions
are limited by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of
HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons
who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under
24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature, as well. However, a HUD employee
who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside
the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program
to which the question pertains.

Section 112 of the Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 112 of the HUD Reform Act added a new section 13 to the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C.
3537b). Section 13 contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial
assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those
who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those
who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the
award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance
received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by regulations codified in part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the regulations, particularly the examples contained in Appendix
A of part 86. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD).
(This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the local HUD office.

Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative branches of
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Resident Capacity Grant Applicants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants for Resident Capacity grants must meet the eligibility criteria listed in paragraph A of this Appendix.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Predevelopment grant applicants must be RCs or CBDs meeting the criteria listed in paragraph A of this Appendix. These

has filed an initial or second Notice of Intent to transfer the housing to a qualified purchaser under LIHPRHA, or has
filed any Notice of Intent under LIHPRHA or ELIHPA and the owner has entered into a binding agreement to sell the housing
to the applicant organization, or (ii) the owner has filed a Notice of Election to Proceed under section 604 of NAHA
and is proceeding under the LIHPRHA appraisal process and has entered into a binding agreement to sell the housing
to the applicant organization. This binding agreement shall not necessarily be a formal sales contract; rather,
it may state that the owner will neither work with nor accept a purchase offer from any other entity during the term of
the grant, as long as the grantee is progressing towards a purchase offer, plan of action or resident homeownership
plan, and acquisition in a reasonable period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Conflict of Interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each applicant must certify that its organization is not a ``Related Party'', as set forth in 24 CFR 248.101, and that
no individual that has, or has had within the last five years, a personal or professional relationship with the owner
entity will receive financial benefit from the grant funds. This certification shall prohibit using mutual consultants,
attorneys, etc. It shall not explicitly prohibit using architects or engineers that have worked with the owner or
in the property in the past, as long as there is no ongoing professional relationship with the owner that could be perceived
as a conflict of interest. A nonprofit general partner of an eligible property that is attempting to buy out its limited
distribution partners is exempt from this part of the conflict of interest requirement. A certification shall also
require disclosure, to the intermediary and the tenants of any relationship with ownership, management, or any other
parties to a sale, and will state that the applicant will not seek any financial benefit from project ownership or operations
other than those disclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Resident Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Each applicant will be required to notify residents of the property of its application prior to submitting the application
package to the intermediary. That notification shall be in writing, be distributed to each resident of the property,
and include a summary of the applicant's plan for the property. The notification shall also include a statement that
residents can themselves become eligible applicants under the Preservation Technical Assistance grant program.
In addition, the applicant must meet with the residents of the property at least two weeks prior to application submission,
and give the residents at least two weeks notification of such meeting. In the meeting the applicant must provide the
following information to the residents: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A summary of the grant proposal; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A list of members of the board of directors, if known;

&bull;A list of the proposed development team and management company, if known; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A list of all proposed consultants and attorneys; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disclosure of any relationship with ownership, management, or any other parties related to the owner or, if
applicable, related to the sale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information on how the residents may comment to the intermediary on the applicant's proposal and that residents
shall have 14 days to submit comments to the applicant and to the intermediary on the proposal. This information shall
include a name and contact number for the intermediary and a name and phone number for a contact person in the applicant
organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the applicant is unable to make this notification due to lack of access to the property or lack of resident addresses,
the applicant may contact the intermediary for assistance. The intermediary may contact the owner to request access
or resident addresses for the applicant. If the owner is uncooperative, the intermediary may contact the HUD field
office for assistance. If residents make substantive comments to the intermediary, the applicant will be required
to address these comments prior to any grant award from the intermediary.

C. Ineligible Technical Assistance Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Entities that have applications pending for funds under the HOPE 2 program are not eligible to apply for funding
under this NOFA (because the owner would have already elected to proceed under the distinct requirements applicable
to HOPE 2 grants and is precluded from concurrently filing the prerequisite Notice of Intent under LIHPRHA or ELIHPA).
An entity that is receiving HOPE 2 funding for preservation-eligible property is ineligible to apply under this NOFA
for a grant for that property until the HOPE 2 grant has been terminated due to HUD's acceptance of the owner's filing
of a Notice of Intent under ELIHPA or LIHPRHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Entities that have been awarded grants under the Preservation NOFA (entitled ``Technical Assistance Planning
Grants for Resident Groups, Community Groups, and Community-Based Nonprofit Organizations and Resident Councils'')
issued September 3, 1992 (57 FR 40570), may not receive funds under this NOFA for any properties for which those grants
were funded either until all funds awarded to the grantee under the 1992 NOFA have been expended, or until the grant
under the September 3, 1992, NOFA has been terminated as a result of a new grant approval under this NOFA. The total funds
received from the September 3, 1992, NOFA plus the total grant award for this NOFA may not exceed the funding limits
of this NOFA. A grantee under the September 3, 1992, NOFA is eligible for funds under this NOFA only if it also meets the
eligibility criteria of this NOFA and meets the notification requirements of Paragraph B above.

Appendix B: Activity Level and State Allocation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The allocation of funds by State will be determined according to the level of activity in that State as of the closing
date for intermediaries to submit applications to become intermediaries. If additional grant funds are made available,
the State allocations will be revised according to the activity levels at the time the new funding is made available.
The total funding under this NOFA has been divided by the number of active Notices of Intent submitted by owners for
properties in the State. Regional and national intermediaries may utilize funds for their entire geographical areas
on a first come first serve basis, rather than maintaining the State allocations in funding grants. Sub-State intermediaries
will be considered in the States of California, Texas, and Washington. The following is a breakdown of dollar amounts
by state based on activity level by State as of November 30, 1993. This will be updated prior to actual release of funds
based on activity levels at the time of intermediary selection, but provides a good estimate of expected funds available
by State. In addition, the Department will periodically assess activity levels and, if necessary, reallocate funds
among intermediaries.

Statutory and Regulatory Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title X of the Public Health Service Act, enacted by Public Law 91&hyph;572, authorizes grants for projects to provide
family planning services to persons from low-income families and others. Section 1001 of the Act, as amended, authorizes
grants ``to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad
range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services (including natural family planning methods,
infertility services, and services for adolescents).'' Section 1003 of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary

Role and Operation of the Training Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nurse practitioner is an integral part of the family planning system and performs a critical role in the delivery
of high quality family planning and women's health services. Nurse practitioner training programs are focused on
the preparation of registered professional nurses to function in an advanced nursing role as obstetric-gynecologic
or women's health nurse practitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successful applicants will be required to work closely with Central and Regional Office staffs and a network of agencies,
including Title X service delivery providers and nurse practitioner training advisory committees. Title X service
grantees from the regions serve on the nurse practitioner training advisory committees. Successful applicants
will be required to review and consider policy and program goals of both the Title X family planning training and services
programs, solicit advice from the regional training advisory committee, and consult with Title X service delivery
providers about training priorities, course content, and curriculum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nurse practitioner training curriculum must focus on preparation of obstetric-gynecologic or women's health
care nurse practitioners [hereafter referred to as nurse practitioner(s)] for advanced nursing practice. The nurse
practitioner training curriculum must include content sufficient to prepare graduates to perform the full range
of services required for nurse practitioners in the Title X family planning services program. The nurse practitioner
training program graduate should acquire, through the training program, special knowledge and skills in health
promotion and maintenance, disease prevention, psychosocial and physical assessment, and management of health-illness
needs in the primary care of women, provided predominantly in an ambulatory setting. The nurse practitioner will
provide such care in collaboration with the physician as well as with other members of the health-care team.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The design of the nurse practitioner training program, including the curriculum, must be consistent with national
and regional Title X goals. The program must be eligible for accreditation as a nurse practitioner program by a national
nursing accrediting body and must meet national or State recognition requirements as a provider of continuing education
through a national nursing organization or one of its constituents. Graduates of the nurse practitioner training
program must be eligible for State and/or national certification and meet State requirements for licensure or recognition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application should set out how the nurse practitioner training program will address the national health objectives
relating to family planning that are discussed in section 5 of the PHS document, Healthy People 2000, discussed below.
Specific attention should be given to training which would enable nurse practitioners to work more effectively to:
Reduce teen pregnancy; reduce unintended pregnancy among all women; reduce the initiation of sexual activity by
teenagers; increase the effectiveness of contraception, including barrier contraception, among all women; implement
pre-conception care; and reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Successful applicants will be responsible for the overall management of a nurse practitioner training program within
the geographic area for which the grant is made. This responsibility includes:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Developing an annual nurse practitioner training plan, which reflects national Title X program goals and
regional priorities and the training needs of local Title X services grantees;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Developing criteria for selection of candidates for nurse practitioner training, including prerequisite
qualifications. Such criteria should reflect a sensitivity to the unique needs to grantees or trainees for certain
types of training, priority for recruitment of minority nurse practitioner trainees, priority for training nurses
serving in rural areas or Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA's), or other relevant factors;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Developing a process to review applications submitted by nurse practitioner training applicants from Title
X service grantees. The nurse practitioner training program will make the final decision about candidates' suitability
for training applying the criteria discussed above;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Maintaining data on nurse practitioner training characteristics sufficient to allow evaluation by credentialing
bodies, and by the Office of Population Affairs, and to allow self-evaluation by the nurse practitioner training
grantee;

Statutory and Regulatory Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title X of the PHS Act, enacted by Public Law 91&hyph;572, authorizes grants for projects to provide family planning
services to persons from low-income families and others. Section 1001 of the Act, as amended, authorizes grants ``to
assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning projects which shall offer a broad range of
acceptable and effective family planning methods and services, (including natural family planning methods, infertility
services, and services for adolescents).'' Section 1003 of the Act, as amended, authorizes the Secretary to make
grants to entities to provide the training for personnel to carry out the family planning services programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations set out at 42 CFR part 59, subpart C, govern grants for family planning services training. Prospective
applicants should refer to the regulations in their entirety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Role and Operation of the Training Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the regulations, ``training'' means job-specific skill development. Continuing education activities that
are innovative or non-traditional are encouraged. The development or use of self-paced, self-instructional or
mediated training materials which utilize technological advancements in the learning field are also acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the general training program is to provide short-term training, continuing education, inservice
education and staff development for personnel to improve or maintain at a high level the performance of Title X family
planning services providers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Successful applicants will be required to work closely with a network of other PHS agencies, including the central
and regional office staffs, Title X service delivery providers, and regional training advisory committees which
provide representation from all service grantees. Successful applicants will be required to review and consider
policy and program goals of the Title X family planning program, solicit advice from the regional training advisory
committee, and consult with Title X service delivery providers about training priorities, course content, and curriculum.
Because of outcomes from the community planning process and emphasis on community involvement, successful applicants
should also stress mechanisms that solicit input from the ``customer,'' both clinician and client.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing their curricula and training schedules, general training programs supported under this announcement

People 2000, attention should be given to training which would enable trainees to: Work more effectively to reduce
teen pregnancy; reduce unintended pregnancy among all women; reduce the initiation of sexual activity by teenagers;
increase the effectiveness of contraception, including barrier contraception, among all women; implement pre-conception
care; and reduce sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), contractors receiving a contract for more than $10,000 agree to have small and small disadvantaged business concerns
participate in the performance of the contract as far as practicable. Contractors receiving a contract or a modification
to a contract expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) must submit a subcontracting plan that provides
maximum practicable opportunities for small and small disadvantaged business concerns. Specific elements required
to be included in the plan are specified in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act and implemented in FAR subpart 19.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conjunction with these plans, contractors must submit semiannual reports of their progress on Standard Form 294,
Subcontracting Report for Individual Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A satisfactory subcontracting plan is required before a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)
can be awarded. The contracting officer must examine the information in the proposed plan to determine if the plan
is in compliance with the Small Business Act and the FAR. In addition, the information is used for policy and management
control purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information submitted on Standard Form 294 is used to assess contractors' compliance with their subcontracting
plans.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Annual Reporting Burden
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual reporting burden is estimated as follows: Respondents, 1,625; responses per respondent, 36; total annual
responses, 58,500; preparation hours per response, 6; and total response burden hours, 351,000. This represents
an increase in the previously approved burden to reflect the number of subcontracting plans that may be required with
initial offers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed rule revises 44.302, Requirements, and 52.244&hyph;2, Subcontracts (Cost-Requirements, and Letter
Contracts), pertaining to performance of Contractors' Purchasing Systems Reviews (CPSR's) and subcontractor
consent requirements, respectively. The rule raises the threshold at (1) 44.302(a) for performing CPSR's from $10
million to $25 million to recognize the effects of inflation on this threshold; (2) 52.244&hyph;2(a)(4) to recognize
the increased costs of special test equipment and the effects of inflation since the threshold was established; and
(3) 52.244&hyph;2(b)(1) to recognize the effects of raising hourly wage rates and contract costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No previous clearance for this requirement existed. The burden hours being requested take into consideration the
revised (raised) thresholds; i.e., a reduction in burden on contractors from the present requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of a contractor purchasing system review (CPSR), as discussed in part 44 of the Federal Acquisition
Regulation, is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness with which the contractor spends Government funds and
complies with Government policy when subcontracting. The review provides the administrative contracting officer
a basis for granting, withholding, or withdrawing approval of the contractor's purchasing system. These revisions
are a result of recommendations submitted by industry. The rule reduces burden on contractors by decreasing surveillance
and increasing dollar thresholds at which contractors are required to provide notification of intent to subcontract.

B. Annual Reporting Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Total annual public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 26,860 hours, including
the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any
other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to General Services
Administration, FAR Secretariat, 18th &amp; F Streets, NW., room 4035, Washington, DC 20405, and to the FAR Desk Officer,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice contains six proposed priorities under the D&amp;U program. These proposed priorities would train persons
with rights and duties under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The six proposed priority areas are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Independent living centers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Family organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) School districts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) State and local ADA coordinators and policymakers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Hispanics with rights and duties under the ADA whose proficiency in English is limited; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Standards for accessible design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Authority for the D&amp;U program is contained in sections 202(b)(2) and 204(a) and 204(b)(6) of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 760&hyph;762). Under this program the Secretary makes awards to public and private
organizations, including institutions of higher education and Indian tribes or tribal organizations. Under the
regulations for this program (see 34 CFR 355.32), the Secretary may establish priorities by reserving funds to support
particular activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed priorities support the National Education Goals. National Education Goal 5 calls for all Americans
to possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities
of citizenship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary will announce the final funding priorities in a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The final priorities will be determined by responses to this notice, available funds, and other considerations
of the Department. Funding of particular projects depends on the final priorities, the availability of funds, and
the quality of the applications received. The publication of these proposed priorities does not preclude the Secretary
from proposing additional priorities, nor does it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject
to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.

Unless indicated otherwise in the proposed priority, the Secretary proposes that the following requirements apply
to the training projects: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants for the training projects must identify the target groups and organizations that will be selected for
training as specified in each of the priorities and describe in detail how the project will schedule and provide training
during national, regional, State, or local conferences and meetings of the selected organizations. Applicants
must demonstrate knowledge of the extent to which the target groups and organizations have received prior training
on the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants for training projects must describe how the project will utilize a variety of training methods and deliver
training in formats and styles that are accessible to individuals with a range of sensory, communication, cognitive,
and learning disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants must establish a timetable for beginning training activities and demonstrate that key staff and facilities
will be available in order to achieve a comprehensive nationwide program within the period of the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training project must consult with each of NIDRR's regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers
(DBTACs) during the development of its schedule of training activities. To the maximum extent feasible, the training
project must conduct its training activities in collaboration with each of the DBTACs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training project must develop two schedules of regional training activities. The first schedule of training
activities must be finalized and training must begin within six months after the award of the grant. The second schedule
must be finalized within eighteen months after the award of the grant. The training project must carry out its training
activities as equitably as possible across and within each region of the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training project must have a staff with expertise on the ADA and training, and carry out its training activities
using those staff persons. The training project must not rely primarily on subcontractors to carry out its training
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training project must include individuals with disabilities or their family members or representatives to the
maximum extent possible in all phases of the project's activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training project must submit final drafts of the training materials it produces to NIDRR for review of their legal
sufficiency. The training project must submit monthly status reports on its training activities through NIDRR's
ADA Technical Assistance Coordination Contract to NIDRR. Each training project must submit its final report to the
National Rehabilitation Information Center clearinghouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training project must cooperate with other Federal agencies that provide technical assistance and training
on the ADA, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 101&hyph;336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was enacted on July 26, 1990, prohibits
discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, public accommodations, transportation,
State and local government services, and telecommunications. In 1991 NIDRR established an ADA technical assistance
program made up of ten regional Disability and Business Technical Assistance Centers (DBTACs_previously, Disability
and Business Accommodation Centers), two national training projects, three materials development projects, and
an ADA technical assistance coordination contract. The two national training projects addressed the needs of persons
affiliated with independent living centers and peer and family networks. These training projects' which were awarded
for three years, will complete their activities in fiscal year (FY) 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For FY 1994 Congress provided NIDRR with additional funding which it directed be used ``for training activities related
to the implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act'' (1994 Senate Appropriations Committee Report, p.
207). In accordance with this congressional directive, NIDRR proposes to establish six new training projects that
will be supported by the additional funding that Congress provided as well as by existing NIDRR funds. The training
projects will enhance the capacity of those with rights and duties under the ADA to facilitate its implementation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIDRR has consulted with a range of relevant Federal agencies, including, but not limited to, DOJ, EEOC, the Architectural
and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (ATBCB), the Department of Transportation, and the National Council
on Disability, as well as representatives from disability organizations, to develop responsive and meaningful
training projects that will complement the planned efforts of other public and private agencies. These priorities
were developed on the basis of these consultations and relevant information from NIDRR projects, including the ADA
technical assistance projects. NIDRR intends to continue to coordinate activities under this program with other
Federal agencies and with other public and private initiatives to implement the ADA.

Proposed Priority 1: ADA Training for Independent Living Centers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The more than 400 Independent Living Centers (ILCs) in the United States emphasize consumer control and peer services.
These ILCs have a strong incentive to promote the successful implementation of the ADA. ILCs serve as resources not
only to persons with disabilities in their communities, but also to individuals and entities with responsibilities
under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary results from a survey conducted by the Independent Living Research Utilization Program (ILRU) of persons
associated with ILCs from around the country indicate that knowledge concerning specific sections of the ADA is not
high, even among persons who have a direct interest in effective ADA implementation. Initial analysis of these data
suggests that a lack of training opportunities and high-turnover among the staff who are trained are factors in the
current level of knowledge of persons associated with ILCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some ILCs have had opportunities to participate in ADA training activities sponsored by Federal agencies, and many
ILCs have developed into sophisticated community resources on the ADA. Training projects for the ILCs have generally
taken the form of an ILC sending a representative to attend an intensive ADA training session over a number of days.
This approach has some limitations in terms of impact due to the high turnover of ILC staff and multiple or shifting
work responsibilities in the ILC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other ILCs, due in large part to their size or location, have not had ADA training opportunities sponsored by Federal
agencies. This group of ILCs is the primary target audience for this training project. The secondary target group
for the training project is composed of those ILCs who have lost their ADA-trained staff person. The project is intended
to enable both of these groups of ILCs to become experts on the ADA so that their staff, associates and volunteers can
answer technical questions, advise individuals on their rights or responsibilities, make referrals, increase
awareness of the ADA in their community, and conduct ADA training activities for covered entities in their community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Rehabilitation Information Center (NARIC) publishes a National Directory of Information Sources
on Disability that includes information on organizations serving the disability community. According to the NARIC
staff who are updating this directory, there are a minimum of 411 organizations providing information or direct services
to persons with disabilities and their families. These organizations disseminate information through national,
State, and local conferences, as well as publications such as newsletters and brochures. They also provide training,
using a variety of means and settings, to their professional staff as well as to their membership. According to representatives
of disability organizations, the extent to which national disability organizations, as well as their State and local
affiliate organizations, have provided training or information to their members about the ADA varies according
to the primary mission of the organization (e.g., provision of services or advocacy), resources available to the
organization, and the interest of the membership and its leaders. As a result, knowledge about the ADA among these
organizations can vary widely from one organization to another as well as from one affiliate to another within the
same organization. The purpose of this proposed priority is to provide training on the ADA to persons who are members
or staff of disability organizations that provide services and information primarily to persons with disabilities
and their families by utilizing the existing training and information systems of these organizations.

Proposed Priority 3: ADA Training for School Districts 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are 15,173 regular school districts in the United States according to the U.S. Department of Education National
Center for Education Statistics (1993 Digest of Education Statistics in the United States). These school districts
are covered under Title II of the ADA. Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in all
services, programs, and activities of State and local governments. The Office for Civil Rights within the U.S. Department
of Education (OCR/ED) has been designated to enforce Title II in public elementary and secondary educational systems
and institutions, public institutions of higher education and vocational education (other than schools of medicine,
dentistry, nursing, and other health-related schools) and public libraries. Title II covers three major categories
of programs or activities: Employment; activities involving general public contact as part of an entity's ongoing
operation (e.g., telephone contacts, office walk-ins, interviews, and public use of the facilities); and activities
or programs directly administered by the entity for program beneficiaries and participants (e.g., programs that
provide State or local government services or benefits). School districts that have received Federal funds have
been covered by section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act since 1973. Title II is patterned after section 504, and many
school districts need information and training to understand not only their responsibilities under the ADA, but
also the relationship of section 504 to the ADA. OCR/ED and NIDRR have cooperated to produce a self-evaluation guide
for school districts that includes information addressing the relationship between section 504 and the ADA. One
of the primary purposes of this training project will be to assist school districts to conduct their self-evaluations
with this new self-evaluation guide and implement their plans to comply with the ADA. As part of this process, the project
will enable trainees to understand not only their responsibilities under the ADA, but also the relationship of section
504 to the ADA. The project will place special emphasis on school districts where a majority of the students are from
minority background because of their limited access to outside training opportunities. The project will train selected
educational organizations whose membership have responsibility for complying with the ADA in school districts
(e.g., superintendents, principals, special education directors, school boards, etc.), as well as selected individual
school district's staffs.

Background 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Governors, mayors, city managers, city planners, county boards, agency directors, and other State and local government
officials bear responsibility for ensuring compliance with Title II of the ADA. In addition &sect;35.107 of the ADA
regulations (28 CFR part 35) requires that a public entity that employs 50 or more persons shall designate at least
one employee to coordinate its efforts to comply with the ADA, including investigation of any complaint alleging
its noncompliance or alleging any prohibited actions. Such persons are frequently identified as ``ADA Coordinators''
by State or local governments. According to the most recent (1987) report of the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately
7,665 counties, municipalities, and townships that have 50 or more full-time employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Title II requires public entities to evaluate their current services, policies, and practices to identify and correct
any that are not consistent with the requirements of Title II. State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers
are responsible for ensuring that the self-evaluations are carried out. To ensure that these self-evaluations are
appropriately carried out and the necessary changes made, State and local ADA Coordinators and government policymakers
need information and training about the requirements of the ADA and policy developments in the field.

The Hispanic population in the U.S. totals approximately 22 million people, or 9.0 percent of the population. By the
year 2010, the Hispanic population is expected to become the second-largest racial/ethnic group (National Council
of La Raza Census Information Center, Hispanic Population Factsheet, November 1993).

There are approximately 3,343,000 persons of Hispanic origin with a disability. In other words, one out of every fifteen
Americans with a disability is Hispanic (McNeil, Americans with Disabilities: 1991&hyph;1992, Current Population
Reports, U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1993). In 1990, 17.4 million persons reported that they spoke Spanish at home.
Of these persons, 8.3 million persons, or 50.8 percent, reported that they do not speak English ``very well'' (U.S.
Census Bureau, Language Spoken at Home and Ability to Speak English for U.S. Regions and States, 1993). Hispanics
with disabilities whose proficiency in English is limited, as well as Hispanic business owners and service providers
whose proficiency in English is limited, need to understand the requirements of the ADA. Federal agencies have made
a number of their ADA publications available in Spanish, and NIDRR has piloted an effort with its Region 6 Southwest
DBTAC to provide training and technical assistance to persons in the Spanish-speaking community. This pilot project
has included the publication of additional documents in Spanish as well as efforts to provide popular Hispanic media
with information about the ADA that is sensitive to cultural norms regarding disability. While these efforts have
made certain ADA materials and technical assistance available to persons whose proficiency in English is limited,
more needs to be done. Reaching a target population that is broadly dispersed and as diverse as Hispanics whose proficiency
in English is limited is particularly challenging. The Hispanic population includes people from different cultural
backgrounds and different countries and regions of the world, such as Mexico (63.6 percent), Puerto Rico (10.6 percent),
Cuba (4.7 percent), and Central and South America (14.0 percent) (National Council of La Raza Census Information
Center, Hispanic Population Factsheet, November 1993). For the purposes of this priority, ``Hispanics whose proficiency
in English is limited'' includes all persons from those countries and regions listed above who do not speak English
very well, if at all. In order to reach as wide an audience as possible a training project must collaborate with Hispanic
organizations that currently provide training and information to their members. It must also utilize TV, radio,
and print media that are popular in the targeted Hispanic community. Applicants for this project must demonstrate
Spanish fluency, knowledge, cultural understanding, and experience in providing training and technical assistance
to Hispanic organizations and individuals. Applicants must also include a substantial number of Hispanic individuals
with disabilities in all phases of the project's activities.

Proposed Priority 6: ADA Training on Standards for Accessible Design 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Titles II and III of the ADA require that new governmental and commercial facilities be built in an accessible manner
and require that, when existing governmental or commercial facilities are renovated or otherwise altered, the alterations
be made in an accessible manner. In their regulations implementing Titles II and III of the ADA, the U.S. Department
of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) adopted Standards for Accessible Design for purposes
of enforcing the ADA's non- discrimination requirements in the built environment. For commercial facilities and
public transportation facilities, they adopted the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities
(ADAAG), developed by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board. For government facilities
other than transportation facilities covered by DOT, DOJ currently permits the use of either the Uniform Federal
Accessibility Standards or ADAAG as the ``Standards for Accessible Design.'' These Standards must be followed in
new construction and alteration projects. They also serve as a guide for public accommodations undertaking to remove
barriers in inaccessible existing facilities, as required under Title III. These Standards are complex and made
up of scoping and technical provisions that contain many discrete requirements and necessitate referencing other
technical provisions in order to make an element or space accessible. NIDRR proposes a project to develop a series
of audio/visual and complementary training materials on the Standards for Accessible Design that can be used across
the country at the local level. Local organizations whose members include persons with disabilities, business owners,
building managers, employers, government agency officials, city planners, architects, designers, or other relevant
parties need access to reliable materials that explain the ADA Standards. NIDRR proposes to develop this series of
materials in short discrete segments that could be used in meetings normally scheduled by professional or business
organizations such as local chapters of the American Institute of Architects, local Chambers of Commerce, and other
groups. These materials could also be used by the DBTACs in carrying out ADA training activities. Grant applicants
must be able to demonstrate knowledge, understanding, and experience in the following areas: in-depth knowledge
of the ADA Standards for Accessible Design; thorough understanding of the rationale(s) underlying the Standards;
understanding of the ways in which persons with disabilities use, or are unable to use, the built environment; experience
in the development and dissemination of educational videos; and experience in using innovative and engaging video
techniques such as animation and fade-ins or transformations from actual scenes to diagrammatic or conceptual material.
Samples of an applicant's recent relevant work, including the use of animation or other innovative video techniques
and the development of training materials related to the ADA Standards or training materials on accessible design,
must be submitted with the grant application. Based on the estimated size of the award that will be published in the
notice inviting applications, applicants may propose to cover some, but not all of the topics. Grant applicants must
propose an order of production of the videos and identify the topics that will be addressed in each video. Applicants
must justify their order of production, based on the importance of the topic. Applicants must propose to group topics
on each of the videos and explain the rationale for the groupings.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for waste
management at the Savannah River Site, and to conduct a public scoping process pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS is to provide a basis for DOE to select a sitewide strategic
approach to managing present and future Savannah River Site waste generated as a result of ongoing operations, environmental
restoration activities, transition from nuclear production to other missions, and decontamination and decommissioning
programs. This EIS will support project-level decisions on the operation of specific treatment, storage, and disposal
facilities within the near term (10 years and less). In addition, this EIS will provide a baseline for analyses of future
waste management activities and a basis for the evaluation of the specific waste management alternatives. The preparation
of the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act,
the Council on Environmental Quality National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508),
and the DOE National Environmental Policy Act Regulations (10 CFR part 1021). Background information on the Savannah
River Site and issues proposed to be considered in this EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is also announcing today its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on the Defense Waste
Processing Facility at the Savannah River Site. (See the notice in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE invites individuals, organizations, and agencies to comment on issues to be considered, alternatives to be analyzed,
and environmental impacts to be addressed in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS. Written and oral comments
will be given equal weight. Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments
may be presented by voice mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at
three public scoping meetings to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in
appropriate local media. At the scoping meetings and informal information sessions to be held one month earlier,
DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity to have information discussions with DOE representatives regarding
waste management at the Savannah River Site. The scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary
Information below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Savannah River Site occupies approximately 300 square miles adjacent to the Savannah River, principally in Aiken
and Barnwell Counties of South Carolina, approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia, and 20 miles south
of Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the Savannah River Site has been to produce nuclear
materials that support the defense, research, and medical programs of the United States. The Savannah River Site
production process facilities include fuel and target fabrication facilities, nuclear production reactors, separation
facilities, product preparation facilities, and waste management facilities. These facilities have generated
a variety of low-level radioactive, high-level radioactive, hazardous, mixed (hazardous and radioactive), and
transuranic wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the Savannah River Site is in transition to other missions; the new missions include an increased emphasis
on waste management, environmental restoration, and decontamination and decommissioning. DOE is examining its
current integrated waste management program and the suitability of existing and planned facilities in light of these
recent mission changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two DOE-wide programmatic environmental impact statements, one for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
(Notice of Intent published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 22, 1990; 55 FR 42693) and one for Reconfiguration of the Weapons Complex (Notice of Intent published in
the Federal Register on February 11, 1991; 56 FR 5590), may result in decisions to transfer certain waste management
activities to or from the Savannah River Site. The alternatives for the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will
be coordinated with the alternatives for the Programmatic EISs. The alternatives for the Savannah River Site Waste
Management EIS will also bound the range of waste management activities resulting from the Federal Facility Compliance
Act Site Treatment Plan now under development. The Site Treatment Plan will describe the development of treatment
capacities and technologies for mixed (a combination of radioactive and hazardous) wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE prepared an Environmental Assessment and issued a subsequent Finding of No Significant Impact on the Consolidated
Incineration Facility in 1992. In response to a public request, DOE took a ``fresh look'' into the suitability of constructing
and operating the Consolidated Incineration Facility. DOE decided that while completing construction, DOE would
propose to include the operation of the Consolidated Incineration Facility within the scope of the Savannah River
Site Waste Management EIS. Under the proposed action, the Consolidated Incineration Facility would be the preferred
facility for the treatment of only those wastes for which under Environmental Protection Agency regulations incineration
is the specified technology or Best Demonstrated Available Technology. The proposed action also will evaluate incineration
and other treatment alternatives for wastes where incineration is not the specified technology or Best Demonstrated
Available Technology. In addition, the proposed action will include the incineration of low-level radioactive
waste for volume reduction and the EIS will consider other volume reduction and treatment alternatives. DOE will
not conduct any trial burns at the Consolidated Incineration Facility until DOE completes this EIS and issues a Record
of Decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982, DOE published an EIS and a Record of Decision for the design, construction, and operation of the Defense Waste
Processing Facility, which would immobilize liquid high-level radioactive waste in glass (vitrification). The
vitrified waste would then be encapsulated in stainless steel canisters and stored onsite until a geologic repository
is available for final disposal. DOE then modified the Defense Waste Processing Facility to improve facility efficiency
and safety. A Supplement Analysis was prepared to determine whether modifications as of 1990, primarily the introduction
of the In-Tank Precipitation process and manufacture and disposal of saltstone, required the preparation of a supplement
to the Defense Waste Processing Facility EIS. On the basis of the Supplement Analysis, DOE concluded in 1991 that a
Supplemental EIS was not needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further modifications to the Defense Waste Processing Facility system have now been proposed and are in various stages
of implementation, including process safety enhancement and a Late-Wash Facility. In view of the accumulated changes
and the near-term (estimated 1996) initial operation of the facility, DOE believes that a focused EIS-level review
of the environmental impacts of the facility as now envisioned would be timely and appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE proposes to perform the Defense Waste Processing Facility review in a supplement to the 1982 EIS for the Defense
Waste Processing Facility. Although the analysis could be included in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS,
DOE believes public review and DOE's decision making process would be facilitated by preparing a separate document
because the Defense Waste Processing Facility is a very specialized operation with limited connections to the activities
to be covered in the Waste Management EIS. Where there are interconnections, duplicate discussions within both documents
may be required or the documents may cross reference one another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities at the Defense Waste Processing Facility have proceeded on the basis of the 1982 EIS and Record of Decision.
Construction of the Defense Waste Processing Facility is almost complete, testing of the system with cold chemicals
has begun and processing runs of simulated (non-radioactive) material will begin in the next few months. DOE committed
in an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency and the state of South Carolina to adhere to a schedule that
provides for radionuclide testing at the Defense Waste Processing Facility to begin in December, 1995. In order to
support that schedule and to manage efficiently the high level radioactive wastes contained in the tank farms, in-tank
precipitation must begin in late 1994 or early 1995. A supplemental EIS focussing on the changes to the Defense Waste
Processing Facility can be completed in time to meet this schedule, while the Waste Management EIS is expected to take
several more months to prepare. These two EISs will be closely coordinated. Delay of start-up for the Defense Waste
Processing Facility would cost approximately $21,000,000 per month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Supplemental EIS will examine all reasonably foreseeable impacts of operating the Defense Waste Processing
Facility, including alternative methods of managing the waste streams from the facility. DOE believes that this
will provide sufficient information to decide whether to proceed with operation of the facility in advance of completion
of the Savannah River Waste Management EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed scope for the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS does not include management of spent nuclear fuel
and other materials that have historically been the feed materials for Savannah River Site materials production
and reprocessing programs. Such nuclear materials are being addressed in several National Environmental Policy
Act documents under preparation by DOE: (1) The Programmatic EIS for Spent Nuclear Fuel Management will include,
among other issues, a programmatic analysis of the transportation, receipt, processing, and storage of spent nuclear
fuel at DOE sites, including the Savannah River Site; (2) the Environmental Assessment for Urgent Relief Acceptance
of Foreign Research Reactor Nuclear Spent Fuel and a subsequent broader scope EIS (Notice of Intent published October
21, 1993; 58 FR 54336) will analyze the proposed adoption and implementation of a policy for the acceptance of as many
as 15,000 spent nuclear fuel elements from foreign research reactors; and (3) the EIS for the Interim Management of
Nuclear Materials at the Savannah River Site (Notice of Intent published March 17, 1994; 59 FR 12588), will evaluate
and determine materials that can safely remain in their current form for an interim period (approximately five years)
until disposition decisions can be made and materials that require near-term stabilization to help maintain the
health and safety of workers and the public and to maintain environmental quality. In addition, DOE will also evaluate
converting some material into a useable form.

Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be prepared at the same time as, and in close coordination with, the
DOE Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmitic EIS, which will address DOE complex-wide issues
and alternatives for environmental restoration and waste management policies and practices. Alternatives under
that Programmatic EIS will include decentralization, regionalization, and centralization of waste management
functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The alternatives analysis in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will be consistent with the DOE complex-wide
policies and practices that will be analyzed in the Programmatic EIS. The Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS
will be supplemented, as necessary, to maintain consistency with decisions reached on broader programmatic issues.

The Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS will also be coordinated with the development of the Savannah River Site
Treatment Plan that DOE is preparing in compliance with the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992. The Conceptual
Site Treatment Plan issued in October 1993 identifies waste treatment needs, capabilities, and options for Savannah
River Site mixed waste. The Draft Site Treatment Plan scheduled to be issued in August 1994 will identify DOE's preferred
options for treating the Savannah River Site mixed wastes and proposed schedules for constructing treatment capacity.
The preferred options will correspond to the proposed action in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS.

Waste Types To Be Addressed in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solid low-level radioactive waste forms include operating and laboratory wastes (for example protective clothing,
plastic sheeting, gloves, analytical wastes, decontamination residues), contaminated equipment, reactor and
reactor fuel hardware, spent lithium-aluminum targets from which tritium has been extracted, and spent deionizer
resin from reactor areas. The Analytical Laboratories, Reactor Materials, Reactors, Separations, Savannah River
Technology Center, Tritium facilities, and waste management and environmental restoration activities generate
the Savannah River Site low-level radioactive waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High-level radioactive waste includes the highly radioactive material resulting from the reprocessing of spent
nuclear fuel, including the liquid waste that contains fission products in sufficient concentrations. In the production
of nuclear materials, DOE used the F- and H-Area chemical separations plants to separate and purify plutonium-238
and -239 produced in Savannah River Site reactors and to reclaim fissionable material (uranium-235) from onsite
and offsite sources (e.g., research reactor fuel and material from disassembled retired weapons) for recycling.
These processes dissolved target elements in nitric acid and separated them into (1) a solution of plutonium, uranium,
and neptunium, and (2) liquid high-level radioactive waste. Further processing separated and purified the metals
in solution, and converted the plutonium to solid form for shipment and the other materials for storage or reuse. The
liquid high-level radioactive waste is stored in steel tanks in the F- and H-Area Tank Farms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazardous waste and mixed waste include materials such as lead, solvents, paints, tritiated mercury, tritiated
oil contaminated with mercury, other mercury-contaminated materials and equipment from the tritium facilities
in H-Area, filter paper takeup rolls from the Liquid Effluent Treatment Facility, cadmium-plated high-efficiency
particulate air filters, and contaminated soils. The Analytical Laboratories, Reactor materials, Reactors, and
Separations facilities and waste management and environmental restoration activities generate the Savannah River
Site hazardous and mixed waste.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transuranic wastes include job control wastes (e.g., paper, wipes, cloth, rags, tools, instruments), sludges,
resins, filters, and various other miscellaneous wastes. Transuranic waste contains radioactive isotopes with
atomic numbers greater than 92 and half-lives longer than 20 years at concentrations exceeding 100 nanocuries per
gram. Savannah River Site also manages low-level radioactive waste with transuranic radionuclides at concentration
of 10 to 100 nanocuries per gram in a manner similar to transuranic waste. The Savannah River Technology Center, F-Area
laboratories, and F- and H-Area separations facilities generate the Savannah River Site transuranic waste.

Preliminary Description of Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The ``No-Action'' Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE will analyze a no-action alternative that would assume continued waste generation and current waste management
practices. DOE would continue ongoing activities and implement planned actions, including high-level radioactive
waste management, for which National Environmental Policy Act review has been completed and decisions made. Further,
decisions reached through ongoing National Environmental Policy Act reviews that are completed before the issuance
of a Record of Decision for this EIS will be incorporated into the no-action alternative. Although the no-action alternative
may not be a reasonable alternative in all respects, its analysis will establish a baseline for comparison of the environment
impacts of the proposed action and its alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE would continue waste management practices that are now in effect, including packaging and disposal of low-level
radioactive waste in the Solid Waste Disposal Facility, storage of liquid high-level radioactive waste in the F-
and H-Area Tank Farm, disposal of salt solution at the Saltstone Facility, preparation for vitrification in the Defense
Waste Processing Facility, storage of liquid high-level radioactive waste in the F- and H-Area Tank Farm, disposal
of salt solution at the Saltstone Facility, preparation for vitrification in the Defense Waste Processing Facility,
storage of hazardous waste in hazardous waste storage buildings and the solid waste storage pads, and continued storage
of mixed waste. Drums of transuranic waste on mounded pads would be retrieved, overpacked, and stored with existing
transuranic waste drums on concrete pads; DOE would leave undisturbed the transuranic waste that is in stored in below-grade
culverts or in culverts on mounded pads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also included as part of the no-action alternative are operation of the already-constructed Solid Waste Disposal
Facility Expansion Vaults for disposal of low-level radioactive waste (E-Area) and continued construction, but
not operation, of the Consolidated Incineration Facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The Proposed Action Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is comprised of the no-action alternative activities plus programmatic and project-level actions
to enhance waste management operations over the next 10 years, comply with regulatory requirements, protect human
health and the environment, and support Savannah River Site missions. Project specific National Environmental
Policy Act review that supplements this EIS might be required to reach final decisions on some of these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE will consider various combinations of pollution prevention, waste minimization, treatment, storage and disposal
technologies, with pollution prevention and waste minimization as the highest priority. For each waste type, DOE
will identify the optimal mix of technologies for the protection of human health and the environment, cost-effectiveness,
and waste minimization. DOE will identify the preferred strategy for each waste type that will contain the optimum
approaches developed for specific individual waste streams at the Savannah River Site. Any potential shipments
to or from the Savannah River Site of DOE weapons complex waste and establishment of onsite waste treatment capabilities
would be examined in a manner that is consistent with the Site Treatment Plan for mixed waste and the two DOE-wide Programmatic
EISs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programmatic considerations regarding the Site Treatment Plan, land use planning, technology development, and
pollution prevention would be included in the proposed action alternative. DOE will ensure that these strategies
are consistent with those identified in the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS. Although
specific environmental restoration and decontamination and decommissioning activities would be subject to separate
National Environmental Policy Act review, as appropriate, DOE will provide its best current estimate of waste streams
anticipated from the environmental restoration of existing waste sites and the decontamination and decommissioning
of surplus facilities. Similarly, DOE will base the proposed action on this best current estimate of waste streams
that might be received from offsite under decisions resulting from the Environmental Restoration and Waste Management
and Reconfiguration Programmatic EISs and the Federal Facility Compliance Act/Site Treatment Plan process.

Low-Level Radioactive Waste
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE proposes to reduce the volume of solid nonhazardous low-level radioactive waste. DOE would package the low-level
radioactive waste in accordance with the Waste Acceptance Criteria established for the Solid Waste Disposal Facility
(E-Area) Expansion Vaults (operation of the E-Area vaults is based on completed National Environmental Policy Act
reviews and is included in the no-action alternative). As part of the proposed action alternative, volume reduction
technology(ies) would replace existing Savannah River Site compactors, which are reaching the end of their useful
lives. The immediate requirement is to process contact-handled waste; the proposed facility(ies) would have limited
capability to volume-reduce equipment. Subsequently, DOE would develop the capability to volume-reduce remotely
handled waste. DOE would also develop treatment capabilities for liquid low-level radioactive waste (e.g., tritiated

Liquid High-Level Radioactive Waste
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The management of liquid high-level radioactive waste including storage in the F- and H-Area Tank Farm, disposal
of salt solution at the Saltstone Facility, and preparation for vitrification in the Defense Waste Processing Facility
is the same for the proposed action as for the no-action alternative. The examination of the potential environmental
impacts of operating the Defense Waste Processing Facility and associated high-level radioactive waste facilities
at the Savannah River Site as they are presently designed will be done in the Defense Waste Processing Facility Supplemental
EIS. The cumulative impacts of liquid high-level radioactive waste management, including the results from the Defense
Waste Processing Facility Supplemental EIS, will be incorporated into the Savannah River Site Waste Management
EIS.

Hazardous Waste/Mixed Waste
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Draft Site Treatment Plan will consider the Consolidated Incineration Facility a ``planned'' facility for mixed
waste treatment. As part of the proposed action, this EIS will consider other alternatives for waste for which incineration
has not been established as the Best Demonstrated Available Technology or specified technology, including potential
offsite options and commercialization, for incinerable Savannah River Site hazardous and mixed wastes. For example,
DOE could construct and operate a new facility permitted under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act at the Savannah
River Site to receive, handle, treat, and repackage hazardous and mixed waste. This facility could also provide size
reduction and repackaging of hazardous and mixed wastes in preparation for treatment at the Consolidated Incineration
Facility. The proposed treatment building would be able to handle waste that DOE could not treat elsewhere on the Savannah
River Site or send such waste offsite for treatment and disposal. DOE would also evaluate treatment options for non-incinerable
hazardous and mixed wastes.

Transuranic Waste
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed action, DOE would prepare both currently-stored and newly-generated transuranic waste for certification
and disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant or for reclassification and disposal as low-level radioactive waste.
Facilities would be provided to sort, characterize, and repackage drums of low-activity (less than a total of 0.5
curie per 55-gallon drum) transuranic waste in preparation for direct shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant
or for storage until treatment to a final waste form. Portions of these activities are included in the no-action alternative
because they are covered in the completed Environmental Assessment for Management Activities for Retrieved and
Newly Generated Transuranic Waste (DOE/EA&hyph;0315).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE would provide treatment, such as vitrification or stabilization, for retrievably stored transuranic wastes
with activity greater than 0.5 curie per container if required to meet future criteria of the Waste Isolation Pilot
Plant or another Federal repository. The proposed action would provide the capability to treat high-activity waste
drums, boxes, etc., for shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant or another repository. DOE would design treatment
facilities when it has a better understanding of Waste Isolation Pilot Plant acceptance requirements for the transuranic
waste stream.

(3) The ``Minimum Treatment, Storage, and Disposal'' Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternative represents a lower-bound of waste management activities at the Savannah River Site. The quantities
and characteristics of the waste would be based on reasonable lower-bound estimates of ongoing operations, onsite
environmental restoration and decontamination and decommissioning waste, and wastes that DOE might receive from
offsite as a result of Federal Facility Compliance Act, Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic
EIS, and Reconfiguration Programmatic EIS decisions. Also consistent with alternatives being considered in the
Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Programmatic EIS, certain quantities of waste in storage and newly
generated waste would be shipped offsite.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) The ``Maximum Treatment, Storage, and Disposal'' Alternative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative represents a condition where the Savannah River Site would manage more waste than that anticipated
under the proposed action. The quantities and characteristics of the waste would be based on reasonable upper-bound
estimates of ongoing operations, on site environmental restoration and decontamination and decommissioning waste,
and wastes that DOE might receive from offsite as a result of Federal Facility Compliance Act, Environmental Restoration
and Waste Management Programmatic EIS, and Reconfiguration Programmatic EIS decisions. Under this alternative,
DOE would augment its waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities at the Savannah River Site. This increase
will be described and analyzed in terms of an increment above the current and projected quantities used in the analysis
of the proposed action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will host a series of informal information sessions to provide the public with additional information on waste
management at the Savannah River Site and the proposed actions and alternatives discussed in this Notice of Intent.
These sessions are intended to promote conversation with DOE representatives available to answer questions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oral and written comments will be received at public scoping meetings to be held at the locations and times indicated
above. The meetings will be chaired by a presiding officer and attended by DOE officials. The public scoping meetings
will not be conducted as evidentiary hearings; speakers will not be cross-examined, although the presiding officer
and DOE representatives present may ask clarifying questions. The DOE panel members will respond to comments and
questions from the public. In addition DOE representatives will be available to discuss the Savannah River Site waste
management program in informal conversations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate scheduling of speakers, requests to speak at these meetings may be made in advance by calling 1&hyph;800&hyph;242&hyph;8269
between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, or by calling Mr. Stephen R. Wright at 803&hyph;725&hyph;3957
at least two days before the designated meeting. To ensure that everyone has an adequate opportunity to speak, five
minutes will be allotted each speaker. Depending on the number of persons who request an opportunity to speak, the
presiding officer may allow more time for speakers representing multiple parties or organizations. Persons wishing
to speak on behalf of organizations should identify the organization in their request. Persons who have not submitted
an advance request to speak may register at the meetings and will be called on to speak in the order of registration as
time permits. Written comments also will be accepted at the meetings, and speakers are encouraged to provide written
versions of their oral comments for the record.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
and to conduct a public scoping process pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended
(42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), to examine the environmental impacts of the modifications made to the Defense Waste Processing Facility and associated
high-level waste facilities at the Savannah River Site. The Supplemental EIS will supplement the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) that DOE issued in 1982 (DOE/EIS&hyph;0082), and will evaluate whether and how to proceed
with the Defense Waste Processing Facility in light of the changes in processes and facilities that have occurred
since the 1982 EIS was issued. That EIS, its Record of Decision, and a subsequent Environmental Assessment,

Waste Form Selection for Savannah River Plant High-Level Waste 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(DOE/EA&hyph;0179), supported the preferred alternative for the construction and operation of the Defense Waste
Processing Facility. The specific process and facility modifications that have been introduced or are being implemented
in the Defense Waste Processing Facility system since the Record of Decision are discussed in the Supplementary Information
section of this Notice of Intent. Background information on the Savannah River Site and issues proposed to be considered
in this Supplemental EIS are presented in the Supplementary Information below as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE also is announcing today its intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for Waste Management at the Savannah
River Site. (See the notice in this issue of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE invites individuals, organizations, and agencies to comment on issues to be considered, alternatives to be analyzed,
and environmental impacts to be addressed in the Supplemental EIS. Written and oral comments will be given equal weight.
Written comments should be directed to Stephen R. Wright at the address below. Oral comments may be presented by voice
mail at the telephone number below. Interested parties are invited to present comments at three public scoping meetings
to be held at the dates and places indicated below. Additional notice will be given in appropriate media. At the scoping
meetings and at informal information sessions held one month earlier, DOE also will provide the public with an opportunity
to engage in informal discussions with DOE representatives regarding the Defense Waste Processing Facility. The
scoping process and procedures are described in the Supplementary Information below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Savannah River Site occupies approximately 300 square miles adjacent to the Savannah River, primarily in Aiken
and Barnwell Counties in South Carolina. The Site is approximately 25 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia, and 20
miles south of Aiken, South Carolina. Since its establishment, the mission of the Savannah River Site has been to produce
nuclear materials that support the defense, research, and medical programs of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, the Savannah River Site is in transition to other missions, which include increased emphasis on waste
management, environmental restoration, and decontamination and decommissioning. With these mission changes
in mind, DOE is examining its integrated waste management program and the suitability of existing and planned facilities.
The Defense Waste Processing Facility is one of the vital components of the waste management program at Savannah River
Site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982 DOE published an EIS and a Record of Decision documenting its decision to construct and operate the Defense
Waste Processing Facility, which would immobilize liquid high-level radioactive waste in glass (vitrification).
The vitrified waste would then be encapsulated in stainless steel canisters and stored onsite until a geologic repository
is available for final disposal. DOE then modified the Defense Waste Processing Facility to improve facility efficiency
and safety. A Supplement Analysis was prepared to determine whether modifications as of 1990, primarily the introduction
of the In-Tank Precipitation process and manufacture and disposal of saltstone, required the preparation of a supplement
to the Defense Waste Processing Facility EIS. On the basis of the Supplement Analysis, DOE concluded in 1991 that a
Supplemental EIS was not needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further modifications to the Defense Waste Processing Facility system have now been proposed and are in various stages
of implementation, including process safety enhancement and a Late Wash Facility. In view of the accumulated changes
and the near-term (estimated 1996) initial operation of the facility, DOE believes that a focused EIS-level review
of the environmental impacts of the facility as now envisioned would be timely and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific process and facility modifications that are being implemented in the Defense Waste Processing Facility
system since the Record of Decision include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In-Tank Precipitation_The original Defense Waste Processing Facility design used ion exchange to separate soluble
radionuclides from salt solution. Research and development efforts indicated that an in-tank precipitation process
would remove more than 99.9 percent of the radioactivity in salt solution. DOE has incorporated the In-Tank Precipitation
process as a replacement for ion exchange as a Defense Waste Processing Facility modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Saltstone Manufacturing and Disposal_The process of salt solution disposal originally involved dewatering decontaminated
salt solution, mixing it with concrete to form ``saltcrete,'' and burying it in an engineered trench. The present
design would blend decontaminated salt solution from the in-tank precipitation process with a waste concentrate
stream from the F- and H-Area Effluent Treatment Facility, mix it with cement-flyash grout to form ``saltstone,''
and dispose of it in reinforced concrete vaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Late-Wash Facility_This new facility would give precipitate slurry from the In-Tank Precipitation process a final
wash to reduce the concentration of nitrite and radiolysis products. The result would be the ability to process precipitate
in the Defense Waste Processing Facility vitrification process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nitric Acid Introduction_This process would add nitric rather than formic acid to the sludge in the Sludge Receipt
and Adjustment Tank to bring nitrate concentrations to the desired levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hydrogen Modifications_These modifications to the ventilation system would provide additional dilution air to
components in the vitrification facility to mitigate the potential formation of hydrogen gas in flammable concentrations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ammonia Mitigation Modification_The installation of ammonia-reducing scrubbers at several locations in the process
vessel ventilation system would mitigate a potential safety hazard from the accumulation of solid ammonium nitrate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzene Treatment_The proposed treatment option for benzene generated at the Defense Waste Processing Facility
is the Consolidated Incineration Facility. Environmental Protection Agency regulations name incineration as
the current Best Demonstrated and Available Technology for benzene. The Supplemental EIS will evaluate alternatives
to this treatment option for benzene from the Defense Waste Processing Facility.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, will address treatment, storage, and disposal alternatives for a variety of wastes, whereas the Defense Waste Processing
Facility Supplemental EIS will evaluate the cumulative impacts of specific modifications to the Defense Waste Processing
Facility system. The Waste Management EIS will include waste facilities associated with Defense Waste Processing
Facility, such as the treatment of waste water discharges in the F- and H-Area Effluent Treatment Facility, F- and
H-Area Tank Farm, and the construction and operation of a high-level radioactive waste evaporator in the H-Area Tank
Farm. The Waste Management EIS also will evaluate alternatives to the Consolidated Incineration Facility technology
for mixed waste (includes radioactive constituents in addition to hazardous constituents such as benzene). The
documents will be prepared in close coordination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE proposes to perform the Defense Waste Processing Facility review in a supplement to the 1982 EIS for the Defense
Waste Processing Facility. Although the analysis could be included in the Savannah River Site Waste Management EIS,
DOE believes public review and DOE's decision making process would be facilitated by preparing a separate document,
because the Defense Waste Processing Facility is a very specialized operation with limited connections to the activities
to be covered in the Waste Management EIS. Where there are interconnections, duplicate discussions within both documents
may be required or the documents will cross reference one another. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities at the Defense Waste Processing Facility have proceeded on the basis of the 1982 EIS and Record of Decision.
Construction of the Defense Waste Processing Facility is almost complete, testing of the system with chemicals has
begun, and processing runs of simulated (non-radioactive) material will begin in the next few months. DOE committed
in an agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of South Carolina to adhere to a schedule that
provides for testing with radionuclides to begin in December, 1995. In order to support that schedule and to manage
efficiently the high level radioactive waste contained in the tank farms, in-tank precipitation must begin in late
1994 or early 1995. A supplemental EIS focussing on the changes to the Defense Waste Processing Facility can be completed
in time to meet this schedule, while the Waste Management EIS is expected to take several more months to prepare. Delay
of start-up for the Defense Waste Processing Facility would cost approximately $21,000,000 per month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Supplemental EIS will examine all reasonably foreseeable impacts of operating the Defense Waste Processing
Facility, including alternative methods of managing the waste streams from the facility. DOE believes that this
will provide sufficient information to decide whether to proceed with operation of the facility in advance of completion
of the Waste Management EIS.

Preliminary Description of Defense Waste Processing Facility Supplemental EIS Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Proposed Action Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since completion of the 1982 EIS and as a result of the Defense Waste Processing Facility modifications, new information
about the Defense Waste Processing Facility process has become available to which the public has not yet had full access.
The proposed action of this Supplemental EIS is to continue construction and begin operation of Defense Waste Processing
Facility as currently designed. DOE would continue the Defense Waste Processing Facility process and facility modifications
that are currently underway, would complete startup testing activities, and would operate the facility upon completion
of startup testing. Analysis of the proposed action will allow DOE to determine whether the decisions reached as a
result of the 1982 EIS remain valid in light of process and facility modifications over the last 12 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) The Alternative Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will examine whether there are other reasonable system alternatives for the Defense Waste Processing Facility
(in the context of its current state of construction) such as mitigation measures, pollution prevention efforts,
and facility design or process modifications that could reduce the risk of operation. Conclusions reached in the
1982 EIS concerning alternatives to constructing and operating the Defense Waste Processing Facility will also
be reviewed to assess whether technology developments have occurred that might influence those decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) The ``No Action'' Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will analyze a no-action alternative under which current waste generation and waste management practices would
continue. That is, high-level liquid radioactive waste would remain in the tanks. Although the no-action alternative
may not be a reasonable alternative in all respects, its analysis will establish a baseline for comparison of the environmental
impacts of the proposed action and its alternatives.
