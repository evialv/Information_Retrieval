<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This final rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866 and has been determined not to be a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information complied by USDA, it has been determined that this final rule: (1) Would
have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposed rule was published on June 15, 1993, with respect to the debt management practices of the Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service (ASCS). This final rule adopts, with minor changes, the provisions of the proposed rule.
Accordingly, this final rule sets forth the policies and procedures which ASCS will use to settle debts. ASCS policies
and procedures conform to the guidelines set forth in the Federal Claims Collection Act, as amended by the Debt Collection
Act of 1982. ASCS will also follow the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards with respect to administrative
actions undertaken by ASCS to settle claims. This regulation is necessary to protect the financial integrity of many
Federal agricultural programs by ensuring the Government will be able to collect, or otherwise settle, debts owed
it by any person, organization, corporation, or other legal entity.

This action will not have a significant impact specifically upon area and community development; therefore, review

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (the Act), as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (31 U.S.C. 3711, et
seq.), and the joint regulations promulgated thereunder by the Comptroller General and the Attorney General (4 CFR
parts 101&hyph;105) provide minimum standards for the administrative collection of claims by the United States.
The Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS) require each Federal agency to take aggressive action to collect
debts owed it, and to cooperate with other Federal agencies in their debt collection activities. Federal agencies
are required to promulgate regulations consistent with the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, ASCS follows the Department of Agriculture's debt collection procedures at 7 CFR part 3. However, 7 CFR
part 3 provides that the head of any agency of the Department may adopt separate regulations to be followed for the collection
of claims and debts. ASCS requires separate regulations for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In order to make ASCS regulations consistent with Commodity Credit Corporation's debt settlement policies and
procedures at 7 CFR part 1403 to the extent that it would not conflict with the Act or the FCCS, such as providing for hearings
and reviews to our National Appeals Division; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In order to set our priority for collecting debt by offset; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In order to allow ASCS to depart from 7 CFR part 3 in those areas where it would not conflict with the Act or the FCCS,
such as the requirement in 7 CFR part 3 to send notice by personal delivery or certified mail; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To allow any amendments or revisions necessitated by statutory or program changes to be made at the agency level
rather than the departmental level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation is necessary to protect the financial integrity of many Federal agricultural programs by ensuring
the Government will be able to collect, or otherwise settle, debts owed it by any person, organization, corporation,
or other legal entity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments were received in response to the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 15, 1993 (58 FR 33029). The first commenter questioned why ASCS failed to address the use of alternative dispute
resolution, as required by Pub. L. 101&hyph;552. Pub. L. 101&hyph;552 requires the Secretary of Agriculture, with
respect to each program under the Secretary's jurisdiction that makes, guarantees, or insures agricultural loans,
to prescribe rules requiring each such program to participate in State agricultural loan mediation programs. However,
since ASCS does not make, guarantee or insure agricultural loans, this provision does not apply to it. Rules governing
mediation of Commodity Credit Corporation agricultural loan programs administered by ASCS employees to which this
provision does apply are contained in 7 CFR part 1405. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter also objects to the provision of 7 CFR 792.8 which provides that all debts due ASCS or CCC may be offset
without regard to assignments which may have been filed. This provision was developed to increase the ability of ASCS
and CCC to recoup delinquent debts and to deter the circumvention of offset by such practices as the assignment of payments
to friends, relatives, partners, or subsidiary corporations. Taking an assignment of an ASCS or CCC program payment
as security for a debt has never been without risk. There has always been the possibility that a payment will not be made,
e.g., if a producer fails to comply with contract requirements. Therefore, it was determined that any heightened
risk to lenders is outweighed by the benefit to the Government in the increased ability to collect delinquent debts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This commenter further takes exception to the provision in 7 CFR 792.10(b) which states that ASCS will assess late
payment interest on the full amount of delinquent debts, which means the sum of the principal, accrued program interest
and any other charges which are due and owing at the time the late payment interest is assessed. The commenter states
that this provision is illegal under North Dakota law and has the effect of charging a rate in excess of that which is
disclosed to the borrower. Since ASCS programs are not loan programs, debts due ASCS are not based on amounts borrowed.
Instead they are generally based on failure to comply with contract provisions. Further, agencies of the Federal

This commenter states that provisions of 7 CFR 792.7, which provide for administrative offset prior to the completion
of due process requirements in certain circumstances, have the effect of ``swallowing'' due process. The commenter
also states that payments should be withheld rather than offset during the period before due process is completed.
The language referred to in 7 CFR 792.7 is taken from the Federal Claims Collection Standards with which agencies are
required to be consistent. In addition, taking offset prior to completion of due process requirements does not negate
any rights which the debtor has. Due process requirements still must be completed. Further, there is no benefit to
the debtor in ``withholding'' payment rather than offsetting payment. In either case, the debtor does not have use
of the funds. In fact by offsetting payment and applying it to the debt, rather than merely holding the payment, the
debtor is ensured that any interest assessment will be stopped. If when due process is completed it is determined that
the debtor does not owe the debt, the offset payment will be returned to the debtor, with prompt payment interest when
applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this commenter made several broad policy suggestions which were not within the scope of these regulations.
These suggestions will not be responded to in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second commenter also expressed concern that the provisions of 7 CFR 792.7 which permit offset prior to completion
of all due process requirements would negate the due process requirements. As stated above, that is not the case. Due
process requirements do not stop because offset is taken. They are still required to be completed in the same time periods
regardless of whether or not offset has been taken. This commenter also needed clarification regarding the difference
between the cited provision for accelerated offset and the provisions for withholding at 7 CFR 792.9. Withholding
is a temporary action and monies withheld are not actually credited to the debtor. It is generally used when the amount
due is uncertain. Under accelerated offset, the payment is actually applied to the debt. As stated above, this will
ensure that any interest which may be accruing is stopped. This is more difficult to ensure in cases of withholding
since in most cases, because the amount due is uncertain, there is no recorded debt to which to apply the payment.

the debtor. If the debt is not paid in full by the date specified in the initial demand letter, or if a repayment schedule
acceptable to ASCS has not been arranged with the debtor, the initial demand may be followed by two subsequent written
demands at approximately 30-day intervals, unless it is determined by ASCS that further demands would be futile and
the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial or subsequent demand letters shall specify the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The basis for and the amount of the debt determined to be due ASCS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the principal, applicable interest, costs, and other charges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a late payment interest rate is not specified in the contract, agreement or program regulation, the debtor
shall be informed of the applicable late payment interest rate set out in &sect;792.10.

period of time, by administrative offset from any CCC or ASCS payments due or to become due to the debtor, and that the
claim may be reported to other agencies of the Federal government for offset from any amounts due or to become due to
the debtor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) ASCS' intent, if applicable, under &sect;792.17, to report any delinquent debt to a credit reporting agency no

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) ASCS' intent, if applicable, under &sect;792.19, to refer any delinquent debt to the IRS, no sooner than 60 days
from the date of the letter, to be considered for offset against any tax refund due or to become due the debtor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When ASCS deems it necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate
actions.

and administrative costs, in full, whenever feasible whether the debt is being collected by administrative offset
or by another method, including voluntary payment. If a debt is paid in one lump sum after the due date, ASCS will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Payments in installments may be arranged, at ASCS' discretion, if a debtor furnishes satisfactory evidence of
inability to pay a claim in full by the specified date. The size and frequency of installment payments shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than three years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as otherwise determined by ASCS, no installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits
a certified financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial
statement shall not be required to be submitted sooner than 15 workdays following its request by ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and require the payment of interest at the late payment
interest rate in effect on the date such agreement is executed, unless such interest is waived or reduced by ASCS. The
installment agreement shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for accelerating the
debt in the event the debtor defaults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered,
the debtor may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by executing a security agreement and financing
agreement which provides ASCS a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to ASCS, ASCS may allow the debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary
installment payment is to be applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a voluntary installment
or partial payment, the payment will be applied to such debts as determined by ASCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Cases in which ASCS must adjust, by increasing or decreasing, a payment which is to be paid under a contract in order
to properly make other payments due by ASCS; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Any case in which a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the debt
for the type of debt involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Debts due ASCS or CCC may be collected by administrative offset from amounts payable by ASCS when: (1) The debtor
has been provided written notification of the basis and amount of the debt and has been given an opportunity to make
payment. Such written notification and opportunity includes notice of the right to pursue an administrative appeal
in accordance with part 780 of this chapter or any other applicable appeal procedures, if not previously provided;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The debtor has been provided an opportunity to request to inspect and copy the records of ASCS related to the debt;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The debtor has been given the opportunity to enter into a written agreement which is acceptable to ASCS for repayment
of the debt; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The debtor has been notified in writing that the debt will be collected by administrative offset if not paid; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The debt has not been delinquent for more than ten years or legal action to enforce the debt has not been barred by
an applicable period of limitation, whichever is later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Administrative offset shall also be effected against amounts payable by ASCS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When requested or approved by the Department of Justice; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When a person is indebted under a judgment in favor of ASCS or the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A payment due any person may be offset when there is a breach of a contract or a violation of ASCS program requirements,
and offset is considered necessary by ASCS to protect the financial interests of the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) ASCS may effect administrative offset against a payment to be made to a debtor prior to completion of the procedures
required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section if: (1) Failure to take the offset would substantially
prejudice ASCS' ability to collect the debt; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The time before the payment is to be made does not reasonably permit the completion of those procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) (1) Judgments in favor of the United States may be offset against any amounts payable by ASCS based on information
provided by or obtained from the Department of Justice. Debts due any agency other than ASCS which have not been reduced
to judgment shall be offset against amounts payable by ASCS to a debtor when an agency of the U.S. Government has submitted
a written request for offset which is mailed or hand-delivered to the appropriate ASCS State office, Kansas City Financial
Management Office, Kansas City Management Office, or Kansas City Commodity Office. Such written request must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Bear the signature of an authorized representative of the requesting agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Include a certification that all requirements of the law and the regulations for collection of the debt and for
requesting offset have been complied with; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) State the name, address (including county), and, where legally available, the Social Security number or employer
ID number of the debtor, and a brief description of the basis of the debt, including identification of the judgment,
if any; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) State the amount of the debt separately as to principal, interest, penalties, and administrative costs. Interest,
if any, shall be computed on a daily basis to a date shown in the request. The amount to be offset shall not exceed the principal
sum owed by the debtor, plus interest computed in accordance with the request, and any late payment interest, penalties
and administrative costs that have been assessed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Certify that the debtor has not filed for bankruptcy. If the debtor has filed for bankruptcy, a copy of the order
of the bankruptcy court relieving the agency from the automatic stay must be included; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) State the name, address, and telephone number of a contact person within the agency and the address to which payment
should be sent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Unless prohibited by law, the head of an agency, or a designee, may defer or subordinate in whole or in part the right
of the agency to recover through offset all or part of any indebtedness to such agency, or may withdraw a request for
offset. Notice of such action must be sent to the appropriate ASCS office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g)(1) After ASCS has complied with the provisions of this part, ASCS may request other agencies of the Government
to offset amounts payable by them to persons indebted to ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of a request to IRS for a tax refund offset, the provisions at &sect;792.19 shall apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(h) (1) Debts shall be collected by offset in the following order of priority without regard to the date of the request
for such collection: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Debts to ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Debts to other agencies of USDA as determined by ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Debts to other government agencies as determined by ASCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the case of multiple debts involving the same debtor, ASCS may, at its discretion, deviate from the usual order
of priority in applying recovered amounts to debts owed other agencies when considered to be in the Government's best
interest. Such decision shall be made by ASCS based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Amounts recovered by offset for ASCS and CCC debts but later found not to be owed to the Government shall be promptly
refunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The debtor shall be notified whenever any offset action has been taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Offsets made pursuant to this section shall not deprive a debtor of any right he or she might otherwise have to contest
the debt involved in the offset action either by administrative appeal or by legal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Any action authorized by the provisions of this section may be taken against amounts payable to a debtor who operates
under more than one name, provided there is identical ownership, or ASCS determines that the debtor has established
an entity for the purpose of avoiding the payment of the claim or debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The amount to be offset shall not exceed the actual or estimated amount of the debt, including interest, administrative
charges, and penalties, unless the Department of Justice requests that a larger specified amount be offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) Offset action will not be taken against payments when: (1) A debt has been discharged as provided in &sect;792.16.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) ASCS determines such action will unduly interfere with the administration of an ASCS or CCC program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The debt has been delinquent for more than ten years or legal action to enforce the debt due ASCS is barred by an applicable
period of limitation, whichever is later.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) No amounts payable to a debtor by ASCS shall be paid to an assignee until there have been collected any amounts owed
by the debtor except as provided in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this title by execution of Form CCC&hyph;36 shall be
subject to offset for any debt owed to ASCS or CCC or any judgment in favor of the United States without regard to the date
notice of assignment was accepted by ASCS or CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A payment which is assigned in accordance with part 1404 of this title by execution of Form CCC&hyph;252 shall be
offset: (1) Against any debt of the assignor entered on the debt record of the applicable ASCS office prior to the filing
of such form with ASCS or CCC, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) At anytime, regardless of the date of filing of such form with ASCS or CCC, if the debt which is the basis for the offset
arises from a judgment in favor of the United States, or under the same contract under which the payment is earned by
the assignor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) With respect to all other Federal agencies, offset shall be made of any amounts due any other Federal agency which
have not been reduced to judgment, and which are entered on the debt record of the appropriate ASCS office prior to the
date the notice of assignment was accepted by ASCS or CCC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Any amount due and payable to the assignor which remains after deduction of amounts paid to the assignee shall be
available for offset.

Withholding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Withholding of a payment prior to the completion of an applicable offset procedure may be made from amounts payable
to a debtor by ASCS to ensure that the interests of ASCS and the United States will be protected as provided in this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A payment may be withheld to protect the interests of ASCS or the United States only if ASCS determines that: (1)
There has been a serious breach of contract or violation of program requirements and the withholding action is considered
necessary to protect the financial interests of ASCS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is substantial evidence of violations of criminal or civil frauds statutes and criminal prosecution or
civil frauds action is of primary importance to program operations of ASCS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Prior experience with the debtor indicates that collection will be difficult if amounts payable to the debtor
are not withheld; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) There is doubt that the debtor will be financially able to pay a judgment on the claim of ASCS; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The facts available to ASCS are insufficient to determine the amount to be offset or the proper payee;

(7) Such action has been requested by the Department of Justice.

may not be made unless requested by the Department of Justice.

Late payment interest, penalty and administrative charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Late payment interest provisions of this section shall not apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To debts owed by Federal agencies and State and local governments. Interest on debts owed by such entities shall
be charged to the extent authorized under the common law or applicable statutory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If an applicable statute, regulation, agreement, or contract either prohibits the charging of such interest
or specifies the interest or charges applicable to the debt involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the late payment interest is waived by ASCS in accordance with &sect;792.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To administrative charges as set forth in paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ASCS will assess late payment interest on the full amount of delinquent debts. For purposes of this section, the
term ``full amount of the delinquent debt'' means the sum of the principal, accrued program interest, and any other
charges which are otherwise due and owing to ASCS on the delinquent debt at the time the late payment interest is assessed,
except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (d)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The late payment interest shall be expressed as an annual rate of interest which ASCS charges on delinquent debts.
The late payment interest rate shall be equal to the higher of the Treasury Department's current value of funds rate
or the rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment Act, determined as of the date specified in paragraphs (d)(1)
and (d)(2) of this section. The rate of interest assessed under the Prompt Payment Act was chosen as an alternative
rate to ensure that the Government would recoup interest at a rate which was at least as high as that which it pays for
late payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) (1) When a debt results from a statute, regulation, contract, or other agreement with specific provisions for
late payment interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall accrue on the amount of the debt from the first
day the debt became delinquent, unless otherwise provided by statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) With respect to debts not resulting from a statute, regulation, contract, or agreement containing specific provisions
for late payment interest and payment due date, late payment interest shall begin to accrue from the date on which notice
of the debt, including notice of late payment interest, is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The rate of late payment interest initially assessed will be fixed for the duration of the indebtedness, except
when a debtor has defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement. ASCS may then set a new rate
of interest which reflects the late payment interest rate in effect at the time the new agreement is executed. All charges
which accrued, but which were not collected under the defaulted agreement, shall be added to the principal to be paid
under a new repayment agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The late payment interest on delinquent debts will accrue on a daily basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a penalty charge of three (3) percent per annum will be
assessed on any portion of a debt which remains unpaid ninety (90) days after the date described in paragraph (d)(1)
or (d)(2) of this section, if no repayment schedule satisfactory to ASCS has been agreed upon. Such penalty charge
will be assessed retroactively from the date late payment interest began to accrue and applied on a daily basis. Such
rate shall continue to accrue until the delinquent debt has been paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) ASCS shall assess as administrative charges the additional costs of processing delinquent debts against the
debtor, to the extent such costs are attributable to the delinquency. Such costs include, but are not limited to, costs
incurred in obtaining a credit report, costs of employing commercial firms to locate debtor, costs of employing contractors
for collection services, costs of selling collateral or property to satisfy the debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, payments will be applied first to administrative charges,
second to the penalty charge assessed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section and late payment interest,
and third to outstanding principal.

(a) ASCS shall waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges on a debt or any portion of
a debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment interest began to accrue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) ASCS may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion of the penalty charge on debts which are appealed
in accordance with 7 CFR part 780 or other applicable appeal procedures from either the date of the appeal or the date
such interest began to accrue, whichever is later, until the date a final administrative determination is issued.
Such waiver shall not apply for any delay due to:

If the opportunity to appeal the determination has not previously been provided under part 24 of this title or part

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Marketing Order Nos. 916 and 917 (7 CFR parts 916 and 917) regulating
the handling of nectarines and peaches grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the orders. The orders are
effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter
referred to as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA
is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not
be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder,
are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf.
Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 300 California nectarine and peach handlers subject to regulation under the orders covering nectarines
and peaches grown in California, and about 1,800 producers of these fruits in California. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000.
A majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Nectarine Administrative Committee (NAC) recommended that the handling requirements for California nectarines
be revised, and the Peach Commodity Committee (PCC) recommended that the handling requirements for California peaches
be revised. These committees meet prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on
a continuous basis for California nectarines and peaches under the orders. These committee meetings are open to the
public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations
and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or
termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

Regulatory Periods (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;916.350, California Nectarine Container and Pack Regulation (7 CFR 916.350), fresh nectarine shipments
are regulated by container and pack during the period April 15 through October 31 each year. Under &sect;916.356,
California Nectarine Grade and Size Regulation (7 CFR 916.356, as amended at 58 FR 8534, February 16, 1993, and 58 FR
29099, May 19, 1993), fresh nectarine shipments are also regulated by grade, maturity, and size, during the period
April 15 through October 31 each year. These regulations are effective on a continuing basis subject to amendment,
modification, or suspension by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends paragraph (a) in &sect;916.350 and paragraph (a) in &sect;916.356 to change the regulatory periods
in each of these sections to April 1 through October 31 each year, so that all nectarine shipments made each season are
covered by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (a)(7) of &sect;916.356 is revised to change
the beginning date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh nectarines
during the April 1_April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The NAC unanimously recommended this change.

Container and Pack Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.350 specifies container and pack requirements for fresh nectarine shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;916.350 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of nectarines in
a 16-pound sample for each tray-pack size designation. This rule revises paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350
by modifying Table 1 to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and
adding a new Table 2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these revised container marking requirements for nectarines after a comprehensive review of
the appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled
containers for all nectarine varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different
varieties of fruit during the course of the season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises &sect;916.350 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises &sect;916.356 by redesignating
current paragraph (b) as (c) and adding a new paragraph (b) to that section. These revisions specify the procedure
to be used in determining whether nectarines meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category
in this section when applying the 16-pound sample requirements. Under this procedure, a sample consisting of one-half
of the number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample
weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half
a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum
size requirements on the basis of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must be used to determine if the fruit meets minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of nectarines could be adequately
determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce
inspection time and inspection costs.

Maturity Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies maturity guides for fresh nectarines in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including Table 1, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table 1 of &sect;916.356 for nectarines. This rule revises Table 1 of paragraph
(a)(1)(i) of &sect;916.356 for nectarines to add maturity guides for 18 nectarine varieties and to change the maturity
guide for two nectarine varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these maturity guide changes for these nectarine varieties based on a continuing review of their
individual maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the
``well matured'' level of maturity for such varieties.

Size Requirements (Nectarines) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 916.356 specifies size requirements for fresh nectarines in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(9). This rule
revises &sect;916.356 to establish variety-specific size requirements for seven nectarine varieties that were
produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages for the first time during the 1993 season.
Paragraph (a)(3) is revised to include the May Kist variety; and paragraph (a)(6) of &sect;916.356 is revised to include
the Arctic Rose, Del Rio Rey, Kay Diamond, Late Red Jim, Prima Diamond, and Red Glen varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises &sect;916.356 to remove five nectarine varieties from the variety-specific size requirements
specified in the section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced during the 1993
season. Paragraph (a)(4) of that section is revised to remove the Apache and Early May Grande nectarine varieties;
and paragraph (a)(6) is revised to remove the Nectarine #4, Tasty Free, and 9&hyph;86&hyph;04&hyph;87 nectarine
varieties. Nectarine varieties removed from the nectarine variety-specific list become subject to the non-listed
variety size requirements specified in paragraphs (a)(7), (a)(8), and (a)(9) of &sect;916.356. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also lowers the minimum size requirement for the Zee Grand variety by permitting as many as 88 nectarines
to be packed in a lug box rather than 84 nectarines, and as many as 83 nectarines when packed otherwise rather than 75
nectarines. This is accomplished by reassigning that variety to paragraph (a)(4) from paragraph (a)(5) in &sect;916.356.
The NAC recommended this change based on a more accurate evaluation of this variety's sizing and maturity characteristics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;916.356, paragraphs (a)(6)(i) and (a)(9)(i) are revised to permit as many as 84 nectarines to be
packed in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and paragraphs (a)(6)(ii) and (a)(9)(ii) are revised
to permit as many as 75 nectarines in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit late-season
nectarine varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the
higher ``well matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit,
because it will assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market
in the interest of growers, handlers, and consumers.

In addition, this rule changes the minimum size requirements for several varieties of nectarines packed in loose-filled
and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for nectarines specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii), (a)(3)(ii),
(a)(4)(ii), (a)(5)(ii), (a)(7)(ii), and (a)(8)(ii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes
made in column 2 of both Table 1 for early-season and mid-season nectarine varieties, and Table 2 for late-season nectarine
varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;916.350. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these nectarine varieties, and consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. This rule
is designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh nectarines consistent with expected crop and market
conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;917.442, California Peach Container and Pack Regulation (7 CFR 917.442), fresh California peach shipments
are regulated by container and during the period April 15 through November 23 each year. Under &sect;917.459, California
Peach Grade and Size Regulation (7 CFR 917.459, as amended at 58 FR 32591, June 11, 1993, and 58 FR 43499, August 17, 1993),
fresh California peach shipments are also regulated by grade, maturity, and size during the period April 15 through
November 23 each year. These regulations are effective on a continuing basis subject to amendment, modification,
or suspension by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends paragraph (a) in &sect;917.442 and paragraph (a) in &sect;917.459 to change the regulatory periods
in each of these sections to April 1 through November 23 each year, so that all peach shipments made each season are covered
by these regulatory requirements. Correspondingly, paragraph (b) of &sect;917.459 is revised to change the beginning
date of the regulatory requirements to April 1 from April 15 each year. Handlers ship fresh peaches during the April
1&hyph;April 15 period when the harvest season begins early. The PCC unanimously recommended this change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.442 currently specifies container and pack requirements for fresh peach shipments. Paragraph (a)(4)(iv)
of &sect;917.442 specifies the tray-pack size designations which must be marked on loose-filled or tight-filled
containers, depending on the size of the fruit. The size designations specify the maximum number of peaches in a 16-pound
sample for each tray pack size designation. This rule revises paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442 by modifying
Table 1 to specify weight-count standards for early-season and mid-season peach varieties, and adding a new Table
2 to specify weight-count standards for late-season peach varieties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PCC recommended these revised container marking requirements for peaches after a comprehensive review of the
appropriate size pack-count relationships between the tray-pack containers and loose-filled or tight-filled
containers for all peach varieties. The revised provisions more precisely reflect the characteristics of different
varieties of fruit during the course of the season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises &sect;917.442 by adding a proviso to paragraph (a)(4)(iv), and revises &sect;917.459 by redesignating
current paragraph (d) as (e) and adding a new paragraph (d) to that section. These revisions specify the procedure
to be used in determining whether peaches meet the minimum size requirements specified for each size category in this
section when applying the 16-pound sample requirement. Under this procedure a sample consisting of one-half of the
number of fruit specified for a 16-pound sample for a particular size category shall be used, provided such sample
weighs at least 8 pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half
a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit is used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect to minimum
size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a full 16-pound sample must be used to determine if the fruit meets
the minimum size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this sampling procedure change after determining that the size of peaches could be adequately
determined by using an 8-pound sample in most instances, and finding that application of this procedure would reduce
inspection time and inspection costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 917.459 specifies grade requirements for peaches in paragraph (a)(1), requiring peaches shipped fresh
to meet the requirements of the U.S. No. 1 grade. This rule revises paragraph (a)(1) of &sect;917.459 to provide an
additional 25 percent tolerance for fruit damaged by open sutures, but not seriously damaged, in addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent general lot tolerance currently permitted under the U.S. No. 1 grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended this change to permit handlers to ship peaches with additional amounts of open sutures. Open sutures
are not considered to be a serious grade defect since they affect only the appearance of the fruit. The open suture condition
occurs infrequently in peaches and is most likely due to unusual weather and climatic conditions. However, this condition
can cause considerable economic loss to growers when it does occur, because it sometimes affects a large portion of
their crop.

Section 917.459 specifies maturity guides for fresh peaches in paragraph (a)(1)(i), including TABLE I, for fruit
being inspected and certified as meeting the maturity requirements for ``well matured'' fruit. Such maturity guides
(e.g., color chips) are specified in Table 1 of &sect;917.459 for peaches. This rule revises Table 1 of paragraph (a)(1)(i)
of &sect;917.459 for peaches to add maturity guides for 19 peach varieties and to change the maturity guide for one
peach variety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these maturity guide changes for these peach varieties based on a continuing review of their individual
maturity characteristics, and the identification of the appropriate color chip corresponding to the ``well matured''
level of maturity for such varieties.

Section 917.459 specifies size requirements for fresh peaches in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6), and paragraphs
(b) and (c). This rule revises &sect;917.459 by redesignating current paragraph (a)(6) as paragraph (a)(3) and current
paragraphs (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) as paragraphs (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6), respectively, so that the size regulations
are in sequential order. This rule also revises &sect;917.459 to establish variety-specific size requirements
for five peach varieties that were produced in commercially significant quantities of more than 10,000 packages
for the first time during the 1993 season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) is revised to include the
Crimson Lady and Rich May peach varieties; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) is revised to include the Fancy Lady,
Snow Ball, and Sugar Lady peach varieties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule also revises &sect;917.459 to remove four peach varieties from the variety-specific size requirements
specified in that section, because less than 5,000 packages of each of these varieties were produced during the 1993
season. In &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(5) of &sect;917.459 is revised to remove the Flavor Red peach
variety; and redesignated paragraph (a)(6) is revised to remove the July Lady, Red Cal, and Redglobe peach varieties.
Peach varieties removed from the variety-specific list become subject to the non-listed variety size requirements
specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of &sect;917.459. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also amends &sect;917.459 by revising paragraph (b) to change the ending date of the regulatory requirements
for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph to June 30 from July 2, and paragraph (c) to change
the beginning date of the regulatory requirements for the non-listed peach varieties referred to in that paragraph
to July 1 from July 3. These changes reflect the sizing characteristics of such peach varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in &sect;917.459 redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(i) is revised to permit as many as 80 peaches to be packed
in a No. 22D standard lug box if they are ``well matured'', and redesignated paragraph (a)(6)(iii) is revised to permit
as many as 73 peaches in a 16-pound sample if they are ``well matured''. These changes permit certain late-season peach
varieties to be shipped to the fresh market at a slightly smaller size than in past seasons, if they meet the higher ``well
matured'' maturity standard. The higher maturity standard is important for such smaller size fruit, because it will
assure that the smaller fruit is of acceptable maturity and quality to be shipped to the fresh market in the interest
of growers, handlers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this rule changes the minimum size requirements for several varieties of peaches packed in loose-filled
and tight-filled containers by revising the count-size for peaches specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(iii), (a)(4)(iii),
and (a)(5)(iii). These size changes correspond to the weight-count changes made in column 2 of both Table 1 for early-season
and mid-season peach varieties, and Table 2 for late-season peach varieties cited in paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of &sect;917.442.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PCC recommended these changes in the minimum size requirements based on a continuing review of the sizing and maturity
relationships for these peach varieties, and the consumer acceptance levels for various sizes of fruit. This rule
is designed to establish minimum size requirements for fresh peaches consistent with expected crop and market conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reflects the committees' and the Department's appraisal of the need to revise the handling requirements
for California nectarines and peaches, as specified. The Department's determination is that this rule will have
a beneficial impact on producers, handlers, and consumers of California nectarines and peaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule establishes handling requirements for fresh California nectarines and peaches consistent with expected
crop and market conditions, and will help ensure that all shipments of these fruits made each season will meet acceptable
handling requirements established under each of these orders. This rule will also help the California nectarine
and peach industries provide fruit desired by consumers. This rule is designed to establish and maintain orderly
marketing conditions for these fruits in the interest of producers, handlers, and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant matters presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that the rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined, upon good cause, that it is impracticable, unnecessary and
contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect, and that good cause
exists for not postponing the effective date of this rule until 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because: (1) California nectarine and peach growers and handlers should be apprised of this rule as soon as possible,
since early shipments of these fruits are expected to begin about April first; (2) this rule relaxes grade requirements
for peaches and size requirements for several nectarine and peach varieties; (3) California nectarine and peach
handlers are aware of these revised requirements recommended by the committees at public meetings, and they will
need no additional time to comply with such requirements; and (4) the rule provides a 30-day comment period, and any
written comments received will be considered prior to any finalization of this interim final rule.

(a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending October 31, no handler shall ship:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of nectarines unless such nectarines meet the requirements of U.S.
No. 1 grade: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That nectarines 2 inches in diameter or smaller, shall not have fairly light colored, fairly smooth scars which exceed
an aggregate area of a circle 3/8 inch in diameter, and nectarines larger than 2 inches in diameter shall not have fairly
light colored, fairly smooth scars which exceed an aggregate area of a circle 1/2 inch in diameter: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided further
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That an additional tolerance of 25 percent shall be permitted for fruit that is not well formed but not badly misshapen.
The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make final determinations on maturity through the use of color
guides or such other tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides listed in Table 1 in making maturity
determinations for the specified varieties when inspecting to the ``well matured'' level of maturity. For these
varieties, not less than 90 percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the variety, and an aggregate
area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety, except
that for the Fairlane, Tom Grand, and 61&hyph;61 varieties of nectarines, not less than an aggregate area of 80 percent
of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety. For varieties not listed, the Federal
or Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as it deems proper. A variance for any variety from the application
of the maturity guides specified in Table I may be granted during the season to reflect changes in crop, weather, or
other conditions that would make the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well matured.''

California Peach Grade and Size Regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(a) During the period beginning April 1 and ending November 23, no handler shall ship: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Any lot or package or container of any variety of peaches unless such peaches meet the requirements of U.S. No. 1
grade: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, That an additional 25 percent tolerance shall be permitted for fruit with open sutures which are damaged, but not
seriously damaged. The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service shall make final determinations on maturity
through the use of color chips or other tests as determined appropriate by the inspection agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use the maturity guides listed in Table 1 in making maturity
determinations for the specified varieties when inspecting to the ``well matured'' level of maturity. For these
varieties, not less than 90 percent of any lot shall meet the color guide established for the variety, and an aggregate
area of not less than 90 percent of the fruit surface shall meet the color guide established for the variety. For varieties
not listed, the Federal or Federal-State Inspection Service will use such tests as it deems proper. A variance for
any variety from the application of the maturity guides specified in Table 1 may be granted during the season to reflect
changes in crop, weather, or other conditions that would make the specified guides an inappropriate measure of ``well
matured.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If a grower or handler believes his/her fruit is meeting the appropriate maturity level but the fruit has not been
so graded by the inspector, he/she may appeal the inspection by calling the officer-in-charge of the local Federal-State
Inspection Service office to arrange for an on-site examination of the fruit.

least eight pounds. When one-half the specified number of fruit in a sample results in a number ending with one-half
a fruit, the smaller full number of fruit shall be used to determine the sample weight. If a sample fails with respect
to minimum size requirements on the basis of an 8-pound sample, a 16-pound sample shall be used to determine if the fruit
meets the minimum size requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 9, 1991, DOE published proposed regulations adding Part 830 to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations
in order to establish a body of rules for the safe management of DOE nuclear facilities (``December Notice,'' 56 FR
64316). The December Notice addressed nine specific areas related to nuclear safety: (1) Safety Analysis Reports,
(2) Unreviewed Safety Questions, (3) Quality Assurance Requirements, (4) Defect Identification, (5) Conduct of
Operations, (6) Technical Safety Requirements, (7) Training, (8) Maintenance, and (9) Operational Occurrences.

DOE received written comments from 29 groups on the December Notice and held a public hearing in Germantown, Maryland,
on February 25, 1992, at which five persons provided oral comments. After reviewing the written and oral comments,
DOE has decided to issue a final rule on the sections relating to the general provisions and the quality assurance requirements.
DOE will issue final rules on the remaining proposed sections of Part 830 as it completes its analysis of the individual
sections and the comments thereon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In order to implement the section on ``Quality Assurance Requirements,'' it is necessary to also issue the final rules
on the generally applicable provisions of part 830, &sect;&sect;830.1 through 830.7 and &sect;830.100, ``Scope
of subpart.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventy-eight comments were received on the ``Quality Assurance Requirements'' section.

II. Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DOE has analyzed the comments on the December Notice as they relate to: (A) Part 830, general comments; (B) the general
provisions; and (C) the quality assurance requirements. Section II.A. summarizes the general comments and DOE's
responses; Section II.B. summarizes comments and the Department's responses to the general provisions in &sect;&sect;830.1
through 830.7; and Section II.C. summarizes comments and the Department's responses to the quality assurance requirements
in &sect;830.120. DOE will provide its responses to comments on other proposed sections in the December Notice when
it issues those sections as final rules.

A. Part 830, General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Several comments concerned the statutory authority for part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These concerns related to the authority for adopting the proposed rules and especially to the authority for imposing
civil penalties for violations of part 830. Some of the comments implied that the authority to adopt rules on the safe
management of DOE nuclear facilities was related to the authority to impose civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 161 of the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2201) provides DOE with broad authority to
carry out its responsibilities under the AEA, including the safe management of facilities authorized by the AEA.
This authority is the basis for all the rules concerning the safe management of nuclear facilities that DOE intends
to adopt in Part 830. The exercise of this authority is not dependent on whether a civil penalty can be imposed under
section 234A of the AEA (42 U.S.C. 2282a) if the rule is violated after its adoption. As discussed in the preamble to
the final rule on part 820 published on August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43680), DOE has determined that Part 830 contains the type
of requirements relating to nuclear safety that Section 234A contemplated would form a basis for civil penalties
if violated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several of the comments stated that the proposed rules would impose excessive costs on DOE contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE does not agree with these statements. For the most part, part 830 will codify requirements in existing DOE Orders
with which DOE contractors already are obligated contractually to comply. Accordingly, adoption of the proposed
rules should impose little or no additional costs on contractors. In order to confirm this premise, the December Notice
requested contractors to ``address the specific nature and scope of [any] additional costs to which contractors
would be subjected and explain why these concerns are not already addressed.'' None of the comments identified any
specific additional costs. Finally, DOE believes that the imposition of requirements through rules will add predictability
and stability to the DOE complex and, therefore, result in potentially lower operating costs to contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Several comments addressed proposed &sect;830.1 (Scope). In general, these comments questioned what facilities
would be subject to part 830. One comment suggested that a list of the facilities covered by part 830 should be agreed
upon between Management and Operating (M&amp;O) contractors and DOE to prevent confusion and unnecessary expenditures
of limited resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 830 applies to all ``nuclear facilities.'' DOE believes that the definition in &sect;830.3 is sufficient to
determine the applicability of part 830 to any particular facility. If there is uncertainty concerning a particular
facility, then an interpretation may be requested under part 820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several comments suggested alternative wording relative to the Nuclear Explosives and Weapons Safety Programs
exclusion in proposed &sect;830.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE does not find the suggested alternatives more clear. This exclusion, as worded, applies to activities related
to the prevention of accidental or unauthorized detonation of nuclear weapon devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Many of the comments addressed one or more of the definitions in proposed &sect;830.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE is responding to the substantive comments on those definitions that are being adopted in this final rule. DOE will
respond to the comments on other definitions when they are adopted in connection with the substantive sections to
which they apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment suggested that in order to make the definition of ``contractor'' more complete, the phrase ``laboratory
or program'' be added at the end of the definition after the term ``nuclear facility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 830 is limited to activities at DOE nuclear facilities. Since ``nuclear facility'' is a defined term that does
not contain all DOE laboratories or programs, the addition of ``laboratory or program'' could create ambiguity concerning
the Scope of Part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment suggested that the definition of fissionable material was not broad enough and suggested that mixtures
of nuclides, such as enriched uranium, be included in the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE disagrees with this comment because the proposed definition includes mixtures of nuclides as long as the mixture
includes one or more of the nuclides which can sustain a neutron-induced fission chain reaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A number of comments were received stating that the definition of ``graded approach'' was too vague, and additional
guidance on its application is necessary. A comment was received that relative risk should be a mandatory consideration
for a graded approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of the term ``graded approach'' was developed to describe the process and factors used to determine
which actions would be appropriate for a particular facility. DOE believes that this process should be sufficiently
broad and flexible to take into account differences among various facilities. The intent of the graded approach is
to permit DOE contractors the flexibility to implement activities and processes, as appropriate, to comply with
the nuclear safety requirements for the individual facilities. The graded approach does not exempt a facility from
a nuclear safety requirement. In applying a graded approach, however, a determination may be made that certain actions
may not be appropriate for a particular facility. With respect to consideration of risk, this could be considered
under factor six, ``any other pertinent factors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Several comments stated that the definition of ``hazard'' was too general. It was felt that the definition should
be expanded to provide a quantitative statement to establish a threshold for when a situation posed a hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this comment. The term ``hazard'' includes all situations with any potential to cause harm to people,
facilities, or the environment. Quantitative considerations are taken into account in the graded approach when
the magnitude of a hazard is assessed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Several comments stated that the definition of ``hazard'' should be limited only to potential radiological releases
because the Price-Anderson Amendments Act, which continued and expanded indemnification for DOE contractors from
nuclear accidents and established the civil penalty program under 234A of the AEA, relates only to nuclear safety
issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this comment because nonradiological hazards may have nuclear safety implications. For example,
nonradiological hazardous materials may contribute to the release of or contamination by radioactivity, such as
initiating accidents, or worsening the consequences of accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A number of comments were received stating that the definition of the term ``nonreactor nuclear facility'' was
too vague and that some threshold relative to source term or some potential dose to the public or workers (a quantification)
should be included in the definition. Several individuals stated that this quantification must be provided in the
definition to prevent limited resources from being expended on non-nuclear or low hazard facilities. It was also
suggested that the definition of the term ``nonreactor nuclear facility'' be modified by deleting the reference
to graded approach in the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with this comment because the proposed definition was intended to cover all situations
(other than nuclear reactors) with the potential to cause radiological harm. The reference to the graded approach
was included to take into account the differences that exist between facilities and, thus, to avoid a rigid application
of nuclear safety requirements to divergent facilities and to encourage the taking of actions appropriate for particular
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Several comments recommended various operations (i.e., research and development laboratories, environmental
restoration, sealed sources, Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Program) be exempt from the provisions of these
rules. The potential risks associated with each of these operations was cited as being significantly different than
the risks posed by other nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has determined that all facilities with which nuclear materials are associated (except incidently) should be
covered by part 830. A facility's improper use of, work with, or handling of nuclear materials could result in damage
or injury caused by nuclear materials and, thus, are included in this DOE regulatory regime. The use of the graded approach
will permit consideration of differences among different facilities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Several organizations and individuals inquired if accelerators were nuclear facilities and, thus, are covered
by the DOE nuclear safety requirements in part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accelerators are specifically excluded from the definition of a nonreactor nuclear facility, and, as such, are excluded
from the provisions of part 830. Accelerators are not excluded from the radiation protection provisions of proposed
part 835 since that part covers nuclear activities rather than nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. One comment suggested that transportation and shipping be included in the definition of a nonreactor nuclear
facility because these operations could involve radioactive materials in sufficient quantities to have a potential
impact on the health and safety of the public and workers, or damage the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE agrees that transportation and shipping could involve significant quantities of radioactive materials, and
did not intend to cover these activities in the proposed sections of part 830. Therefore, we have specifically excluded
transportation of radioactive materials from the definition of nonreactor nuclear facility in the final rule. These
activities take place primarily off-site and are governed and regulated by either the U.S. Department of Transportation
or the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules. With regard to shipments on DOE sites, DOE intends to add provisions
covering these operations in subsequent amendments to the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. One comment suggested that DOE be included in the definition of the term ``person.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed definition is the same as the definition in the AEA which specifically excludes DOE. DOE believes that
the rule need not be amended to include DOE because DOE imposes equivalent requirements on its employees through DOE
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. One comment suggested that the definition of ``process'' be modified to include administrative as well as physical
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``process'' is intended to include administrative and physical systems. To make this intent more
clear in the definition, DOE has replaced the term ``system'' with ``series.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment suggested that the words ``fails to meet'' be deleted from the definition of ``quality.'' Another
comment suggested that the phrase ``degree to which'' be replaced by ``condition achieved when.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that these two suggested changes result in a definition of ``quality'' that better reflects
the Department's intent. The modifications have been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. A comment suggested that the definition of reactor was too broad, and that it be limited to include only the reactor,
containment, and critical support systems. It was suggested that such things as ancillary support facilities and
shops be excluded from the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE generally disagrees with this comment. The Department feels that all of the operations connected with a reactor
should be included in the definition because experience has shown that failures in ancillary support facilities
can propagate and cause failures to safety related systems. However, specific items can be excluded from the application
of nuclear safety requirements on a case-by-case basis through the exemption process set forth in 10 CFR part 820.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. A comment suggested that the ``reactor'' definition developed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with
which everyone in the industry is familiar, should be used instead of the one in the proposed rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this comment. The NRC definition for ``nuclear reactor'' contained in 10 CFR part 50 addresses
standardized power reactors. The population of DOE reactors is more diverse, including multiple designs and sizes
of reactors all with different purposes. For these reasons, the Department developed its own definition for ``reactor.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. One comment suggested that the definition for the term ``record'' be expanded to note that it is a document which
is completed according to applicable procedures governing its development, including any review and approval requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees with this suggestion because the proposed additions make the definition too limiting. For completeness,
DOE has added the term ``service'' to the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. It was suggested that the definition of service was incomplete without the addition of the words ``construction,
testing, environmental qualification, equipment qualification, and `or the like''' to the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees with the comment and has modified the definition accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. One individual expressed concern over the confusion that could potentially arise from the statement in 10 CFR
830.4 that, ``contractors responsible for design, construction, operations, or decommissioning of a facility
shall be responsible for compliance with this Part.'' In the potential situation where an M&amp;O contractor performs
construction activities at an existing facility being run by another M&amp;O contractor, the individual questioned
whether one or both of the contractors would be held accountable for compliance with nuclear safety requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 830.4(a) provides that all persons must act in accordance with part 830. Enforcement through the assessment
of civil penalties will apply only where there is a nexus between a person's activity and the violation. For example,
a person who designs a facility will not be responsible for a violation related to the operation of the facility unless
the design was somehow responsible for the violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. A comment stated that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to comply with &sect;830.4(b) which
requires facilities being decommissioned to meet the requirements of this Part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While facilities in the decommissioning phase will be required to comply with the provisions of this rule, the level
to which they are applied will be based on a graded approach taking into consideration the hazards associated with
a facility being decommissioned.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Several comments addressed provisions in certain of the proposed rules which require plans or programs to implement
those rules. These comments stated that more time should be given to prepare the plans and programs and that they not
provide the basis for the imposition of civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, plans that provide the schedules and actions necessary to implement the requirements of specific sections
must be submitted to DOE within 180 days of the effective date of the rule. DOE has decided this schedule is not unreasonably
short, especially since these plans are intended to identify the specific actions and programs necessary to fully
comply with a section which has a corresponding Order that is already effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes the expressed concerns relate more to the question of when a contractor must comply fully with a rule.
DOE expects a contractor to comply with a rule when it becomes effective. DOE understands that, in many circumstances,
a contractor may not be able to take all actions for full compliance immediately. The proposal was premised on the use,
where appropriate, of plans and programs to obtain full compliance with nuclear safety requirements. These plans
and programs were envisioned as setting forth the specific actions for implementing a requirement and the schedule
for taking those actions. DOE has decided to state this premise explicitly in the final rule by adding a definition
of ``implementation plan'' and by specifically requiring implementation plans in appropriate sections. Implementation
plans will set forth when and how a contractor will take those actions necessary to attain full compliance with the
provisions of a section or the provisions of a plan or program required by the section. Implementation plans also will
identify where a contractor cannot attain full compliance with a nuclear safety requirement and what relief a contractor
intends to seek. DOE also has modified Section 830.4 to make clear that, where required, implementation plans, along
with plans and programs, will be the basis for determining compliance with relevant nuclear safety requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE believes the use of plans, programs, and implementation plans will encourage DOE and its contractors to work together
to identify and take those actions appropriate for each facility. DOE expects its contractors will submit plans and
programs that represent a good faith effort to achieve full compliance with nuclear safety requirements as soon as
reasonably practicable. DOE intends to work with its contractors where there are differences about how and when to
achieve compliance. However, DOE will act to ensure that plans and programs are submitted and approved pursuant to
the schedules set forth in specific sections. To that end, if agreement cannot be negotiated with a contractor, DOE
will exercise its authority to modify submitted plans that do not include those actions and schedules appropriate
for achieving full compliance in a reasonable manner. The nature of plans is discussed more thoroughly in the preamble
to the final rule on Part 820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. There were many comments related to the enforcement (Section 830.5) of part 830 using the provisions of 10 CFR part
820. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The responses to these comments were included in the publication package of 10 CFR part 820. The general provisions
in this subpart are unaffected by those comments relating to the specifics of enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. One commenter suggested that 10 CFR 830.7(a) be revised to read as follows: ``A graded approach shall be utilized
to comply with the requirements.'' The individual felt that the intent of the rule is to apply a graded approach across
the board to all nuclear safety requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has not adopted this comment with respect to reactors generally because there are some areas in reactor
safety where a graded approach is not justified; therefore, grading applies only to those subparts where it is specifically
referenced. The definition of nonreactor nuclear facility indicates that grading always applies to such a facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. A number of comments were received which stated that the burden of justifying the use of the graded approach to meet
each of the nuclear safety requirements will require considerable resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of paragraph 830.7(b) is that contractors document the basis for the actions selected pursuant to the graded
approach, where it is permitted. Paragraph 830.7(b) has been modified to state this intent. Implementation of requirements
using a documented graded approach will require less resources than an approach which requires full compliance with
all requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the scope of QAP submittals, DOE agrees that they should be limited to a ``description'' of the QAP. It is
not the Department's intent that submittals of the QAP include contractor policy manuals, organization charts and
charters, and implementing procedures. The definition of ``Quality Assurance Program'' in &sect;830.3 makes this
clear when it states that the ``QAP means the overall program for a DOE nuclear facility which assigns responsibilities
and authorities, defines policies and requirements, and provides for the performance and assessment of work.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding multiple QAPs for one facility, the Department believes that there may be cases where some facilities will
require separate QAPs to address their widely different work. However, the Department also believes that it is possible
in many instances to develop and implement a site-wide QAP where multiple facilities exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. There were several comments regarding the approval of QAPs. The first dealt with the concept of automatically approving
QAPs after 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This concept is not new. The NRC has successfully implemented a similar program for the past 10 years. The intent of
the 90-day limitation (unless approved or rejected by DOE prior to that time) is to avoid situations where contractors
are left without a decision regarding their QAPs' acceptability because DOE exigencies preclude timely review.
It is the Department's expectation that DOE will review QAPs within the allotted time. If for some reason the review
cannot be accomplished in the allotted time, the program will be approved and in effect, subject to DOE's right to modify
the program at a later time. Implementation plans will be approved in the same manner as QAPs. (See response to Question
22 in previous section.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Another comment suggested that annual approval of changes to QAPs was too infrequent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experience at the NRC has shown that changes to QAPs do not manifest themselves at the working level so quickly as to
require formal submittal and review more often than once per year. If an interim change to a QAP violates nuclear safety
requirements, the contractor is subject to enforcement action if the violation has safety significance since a QAP
must be consistent with the criteria set forth in &sect;830.120. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Another comment dealt with the level of approval. The comment suggested that the rule specify the precise level
of DOE approval for QAPs. Specifically, it was suggested that the Program Secretarial Officer be designated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department does not agree that the titles of those persons or organizations responsible for approving QAPs should
appear in the rule because of the potential administrative burden it would cause. Specific titles, such as ``Program
Secretarial Officer,'' are subject to routine changes, and these changes would necessitate routine revisions to
the rule if the titles were included in the text of the rule. The specific level of approval for QAPs should be specified
in the operating procedures of the individual program offices tasked with that responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Lastly, one comment suggested that the rule be revised to state that the contractor's approved QAP be used as the
basis against which assessments would be conducted and the contractor held accountable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed previously, &sect;830.4(c) makes clear that the QAP and the implementation plan for &sect;830.120
will be used to determine compliance with &sect;830.120.

6. Two comments noted the apparent overlap of &sect;830.120 and DOE Order 5700.6C, ``Quality Assurance.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 830.120 is intended to supersede the existing requirements in DOE 5700.6C, ``Quality Assurance,'' for nuclear
facilities. If any quality assurance program is implemented on a site-wide basis, non-nuclear facilities at that
site will continue to be covered by the DOE Order while nuclear facilities will be covered by &sect;830.120. DOE 5700.6C
is being revised to reflect these changes in scope.

Grading

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Four comments addressed the need to consider nuclear safety significance in determining the rigor with which the
requirements of the rule are applied. Several other comments expressed concern that applying the rule, without distinguishing
between the relative importance of the work to which it applies, was impracticable. In addition, there were two comments
regarding the rule's use of the term risk. Both comments proposed that the term ``hazard'' was more appropriate and
better reflected the concept of grading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that the use of the term ``risk'' was inappropriate, but rather than using the term ``hazard,''
a new sentence regarding grading was added to paragraph (b)(1).

Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

8. There were three comments relating to standards. One comment expressed the need for a uniform set of quality assurance
guidelines and standards for use by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that there is a need for a uniform set of standards for all activities, including quality assurance.
The Department strongly supports the development of standards and guidelines. Accordingly, DOE will develop and
issue quality assurance standards and guidance to support promulgation of QAPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Two comments suggested that the rule's ``generalized'' reference to the use of standards was not sufficient to
ensure acceptable work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule in paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;830.120 provides for the use of standards to develop and implement QAPs. Because
there are numerous quality assurance standards and they are continuously changing, it would be unnecessarily limiting
to mandate in the rule a particular standard or set of standards that must be used by contractors. Any number of standards
can be proposed, justified, and approved.

10. There was one comment addressing a perceived reduction in quality assurance requirements. The comment stated
that the rule ``has reduced the level of requirements for the application of material control, process control and
calibration control from the level of requirements specified in DOE Order 5700.6C.'' The comment further stated
that ``the rule fails to adequately address the following 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, requirements: Calibration of
measuring and test equipment, special process controls, control of design input and design analysis, procurement
planning and selection of suppliers, qualification of inspection and test personnel, inspection planning and in-process
inspection, test records and procedure content, identification and control of inspection or test status, identification,
retrieval and retention of records.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the Department disagrees that the rule has ``reduced the level of requirements for the application of material
control, process control, and calibration control from the level of requirement[s] specified in DOE Order 5700.6C.''
The basic requirements of DOE 5700.6C and &sect;830.120 are identical; therefore, there can be no reduction in requirements.
Secondly, regarding the rule's purported failure to address certain requirements from 10 CFR part 50, appendix B,
they are addressed in the following sections of &sect;830.120: (1) Calibration of measuring and test equipment_paragraph
(c)(2)(iv), (2) special process controls_paragraphs (c)(2) (i) and (iv), (3) control of design input and design
analysis_paragraph (c)(2)(ii), (4) procurement planning and selection of suppliers_paragraph (c)(2)(iii),

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. There were three comments regarding the inclusion of planning, schedule, and cost-control as part of the quality
assurance program. All three organizations asserted that planning, scheduling, and cost-control were not directly
pertinent to nuclear safety and, therefore, should not be addressed in the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inclusion of these considerations is a departure from the traditional approach to quality assurance. DOE disagrees
that they are not directly pertinent to nuclear safety. Because the quality assurance program described by the rule
is a management system involving all organizational components, including management and the line organization,
these considerations must be taken into account. Contemporary practice has shown that quality, costs, schedule,
resources, and planning are inseparable and integral parts of the quality system and cannot be separated as they have
been in the past.

12. There were two comments regarding perceived conflicts between Parts 830.120, ``Quality Assurance Requirements,''
830.330, ``Training and Certification,'' and 830.110, ``Safety Analysis Reports'' (SARs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE disagrees that there is a conflict between the requirements of &sect;&sect;830.120, 830.330, and 830.110. Section
830.120, ``Quality Assurance Requirements,'' provides generic training and qualification requirements that
pertain to all contractor personnel performing work at a DOE facility. Section 830.330, ``Training and Certification,''
elaborates on these generic requirements by providing specific training and certification requirements for specific
categories of employees, such as reactor operators, nuclear facility operators, senior reactor operators, and
nuclear facility supervisors. Section 830.110, ``Safety Analysis Reports,'' sets forth the topic areas, including
training, to be addressed in each facility's SAR. The details of training to be included in the SAR will be based on the
generic requirements of Section 830.120 and the specific requirements of Section 830.330.

 The Department agrees and has modified paragraph (c)(1)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Two comments suggested that the term ``significant'' be introduced into Criterion 3 when referring to the types
of problems that require corrective action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is the Department's position that the causes of all problems (not just those considered significant or generic)
should be identified and corrected. In doing this, the rigor with which a problem is investigated and corrective action
taken should be commensurate with the importance of the problem and the work affected (graded approach).

15. There was one comment regarding paragraph (c)(1)(iv). The comment stated that the rule ``makes no provision for
the identification, retrieval, or retention of records as required by 10 CFR part 50, appendix B.'' The comment maintained
that the rule would ``appear to be a step backward in the protection of records, yet the draft safety guide invokes DOE
1324.2A and mandates National Archives and Records Administration rules as applicable to nuclear facilities. This
contradicts the purpose of the rulemaking process which would replace Orders with rules.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As written, the rule requires that records be specified, prepared, reviewed, approved, and maintained. While this
terminology is different than that used in 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, it does encompass the concepts of record ``identification,
retrieval, [and] retention'' as stated in appendix B. Secondly, safety guides do not invoke or mandate requirements.
DOE safety guides provide DOE contractors with acceptable methods for implementing specific parts of the Department's
rules. Safety guides are not substitutes for rules, and while they must be considered by contractors, methods and
solutions different from those set out in the guides are acceptable if the requirements of the rule are met.

 Criterion 5 addresses ``Work Processes.'' The Department considers operations to be a work process. Criterion 5
goes further to require that work (like the operations process) be performed using approved instructions, procedures,
or other appropriate means. Operations procedures, the term used in &sect;830.310, describe how work is to be accomplished
during the operation of DOE facilities. Operations procedures are one type_a subset_of procedures required by Criterion
5 (maintenance procedures are another).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees. The rule establishes basic quality assurance requirements applicable to the many and
diverse types of work performed by and for the Department. Criterion 5 (paragraph (c)(2)(i)) requires that ``Items
be identified and controlled to ensure their proper use.'' The definition of ``item'' provided by the rule encompasses
environmental samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment also stated that the rule did not provide requirements for item identification and traceability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the previous paragraph, Criterion 5 requires that ``Items be identified and controlled to ensure their
proper use.'' ``Traceability'' is one way to ensure that items are ``controlled'' as required by the rule. For that
reason, the rule does not specifically address traceability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Additionally, a comment stated that Criterion 5 of the rule did not address ``special processes'' as does the NRC's
10 CFR part 50, appendix B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In developing the rule, the Department found that work, such as welding and non-destructive testing, have traditionally
been referred to by the commercial nuclear industry as ``special processes'' because of the way their acceptability
was determined (in-process). The rule, because it is not inspection-driven like 10 CFR part 50, appendix B, does not
distinguish between different types of work based on whether or not it can be ``readily inspected.'' How the acceptability
of a work process is determined does not make a work process ``special.'' Rather, the rule, in Criterion 5 (paragraph
(c)(2)(i)) focuses on the line organization's performance of work. Inspection and acceptance testing of all types
of work, both ``regular'' and ``special,'' is addressed by the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(iv), ``Inspection and Acceptance
Testing.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The requirements of Section 830.120 are not limited to the design of engineered structures. Paragraph (c)(2)(i)
of the rule requires that ``work (which includes those suggested in the comment) be performed to established technical
standards and administrative controls'' and that ``work shall be performed under controlled conditions using approved
instructions, procedures, or other appropriate means.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees. As written, paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of the section requires that all procured items (commercial
grade items are one type of procured item) meet established requirements and perform as expected. Nowhere in the section
does it require that procurement be limited only to suppliers ``that have quality assurance programs.'' To the contrary,
the section requires that procured items ``meet established requirements and perform as expected.'' The way in which
requirements are met should be specified in the contractor's QAP taking into account the relative importance of the
item or service being procured (graded approach).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24. There were three comments relating to different aspects of Criterion 8. The first comment concerned the rule's
perceived failure to provide for in-process inspection or test, particularly with regard to site characteristic
testing for remediation work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As written, the rule in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) requires that inspection and acceptance testing of specified items
and processes (this includes testing of site characteristics) be conducted using established acceptance and performance
criteria. In-process inspection and testing is not specifically called out in the rule because it is one of many techniques
for conducting inspections and tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. The second comment dealt with test status. The comment stated that the rule provides no definition of requirements
for the identification and control of inspection or test status as required by 10 CFR part 50, appendix B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department disagrees. As written, paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of the section establishes a basic requirement that
inspections and acceptance testing be performed. In practice, one aspect of properly performing the work of inspecting
and testing is to ensure that the status of the item be known, such that the inspection or test is properly completed
and the item is not relied on to perform this intended function. It is inappropriate to include this level of detail
in a rule whose intention it is to establish basic quality assurance requirements applicable to all DOE facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The third comment dealt with the calibration of instruments and the perception that the rule only addresses the
calibration of process monitoring instrumentation and data collection equipment. The comment maintained that
the rule does not address requirements for calibration interval, accuracy, and stability in process monitoring
instrumentation or equipment used to collect environmental data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In actuality, the rule, as written, addresses both the calibration and maintenance of equipment used for inspection
and acceptance testing (paragraph (c)(2)(iv)) and the calibration and maintenance of equipment used for monitoring
and data collection (paragraph (c)(2)(i)). It is the Department's position that the phrase ``calibration and maintenance''
encompasses the ``requirements for calibration interval, accuracy, [and] stability.''

Management Assessment (Criterion 9) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. There were three comments regarding the requirements of Criterion 9. One comment noted that the requirement to
conduct periodic assessments of integrated performance at ``all'' levels of management is too restrictive and unnecessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees and has revised paragraph (c)(3)(i) accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. A second comment requested clarification of Criterion 9 regarding who in management was required to perform the
assessments. The comment asserted that individual managers have the responsibility and authority ``to assess the
QA program'' within their cognizant areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOE agrees. Criterion 9 recognizes this and requires that these individual inputs be gathered and combined by upper
level managers into an overall assessment of the integrated management system. This management assessment should
seek common weaknesses and areas needing improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. The third comment states that &sect;830.120 ``contradicts the requirements of &sect;830.310 which requires
that the conduct of operations program and its effectiveness on facility operations will be assessed through management
observation and audit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department sees no conflict between the requirements of &sect;830.120 paragraph (c)(3)(i) and &sect;830.310
paragraph (g) because the two are unrelated. Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of &sect;830.120 addresses ``management assessment,''
while paragraph (g) of &sect;830.310 addresses the ``independent assessment'' component of &sect;830.120 which
is in paragraph (c)(3)(ii). To make this distinction more clear, paragraph (g) of &sect;830.310 will be revised to
reflect the language from &sect;830.120.

NQA&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30. One individual observed that DOE had previously ``imposed'' ASME/NQA&hyph;1 for all of its sites and that the
Department would be better served by continuing its use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Neither DOE 5700.6C nor its predecessor, 5700.6B, ``imposed'' NQA&hyph;1. DOE 5700.6B referred to NQA&hyph;1 as
a ``preferred'' standard and 5700.6C referenced it for general information only. In practice, NQA&hyph;1 is a national
consensus standard. It interprets the requirements of the NRC's 10 CFR part 50, appendix B and provides guidance for
developing and implementing quality assurance programs at specific types of nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule does not prohibit the use of NQA&hyph;1 at the Department's nuclear facilities. Just as the NRC has endorsed
NQA&hyph;1 as an acceptable way (there are others) for their licensees to implement the requirements of appendix
B, DOE contractors may use NQA&hyph;1 as a way to implement the rule. In addition, DOE (like the NRC) will permit contractors
(NRC licensees) to use other industry standards as long as their applications result in acceptable product and service
quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. One comment stated that the rule did not provide ``even a minimum level of requirements for software quality as
required by existing DOE Orders and NRC NUREG&hyph;1200.'' The comment asserted that the absence of software quality
assurance requirements was a significant shortcoming in the rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule in paragraph (a)(1)(i) requires that a contractor conduct its work in accordance with the criteria of paragraph
(c). Because DOE considers software to be a type of work, it follows that all the quality assurance requirements of
the rule apply to software.

Suppliers/Subcontractors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
32. Two organizations commented that the intent of paragraph (a)(2) was not clear and that methods to implement its
requirements were not provided by the rule. Additionally, a general comment was submitted exploring whether or not
subcontractors and suppliers performing services for DOE are required under the provision of the rule to develop
and submit a QAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2), which required that subcontractors and suppliers comply with the ``standards of quality set forth
in the QAP,'' has been deleted. After review, the Department determined that paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of the rule adequately
addresses this issue by establishing basic requirements for procurement. It states that items and services (this
includes items and services procured from subcontractors and suppliers) must meet established requirements and
perform as expected. Subcontractors and suppliers are not required to submit to DOE their QAPs for review and approval;
rather, it is left to the contractor to determine the methods for ensuring that procured items and services meet requirements
and perform as expected. Any person, including indemnified contractors and their subcontractors and suppliers,
subject to requirements in a QAP, may be subject to enforcement actions under part 820 if those requirements are violated.

III. Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the public comments, DOE has decided to adopt 10 CFR 830.1 through 830.7, 830.100, and 830.120 with
the modifications described in the previous section and several editorial changes. A section by section description
of the final rule follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.1 mandates that the scope of part 830 is all DOE nuclear facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.2 stipulates that the activities excluded from the provisions of part 830 include activities regulated
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or NRC Agreement States, activities conducted by the Naval Nuclear Propulsion
Program, and activities conducted under the Nuclear Explosives and Weapons Safety Program. The final rule has been
modified to make clear that the exclusion applies to activities of the United States Enrichment Corporation to the
extent that those activities have been certified by the NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.3 provides the definitions of terms related to &sect;&sect;830.1 through 830.7, 830.100, and 830.120.
New definitions for ``DOE nuclear facilities'' and ``implementation plans'' have been included to remove any ambiguity
concerning the meaning of these terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.4, General Rule, indicates that no person shall prevent compliance with the provisions of the rule. In
addition, it requires that contractors responsible for managing and operating the Department's nuclear facilities
shall be responsible for implementing and complying with the provisions of part 830. Paragraph (c) has been included
to make clear that contractors must comply with any plans, programs, or implementation plans required by a section
and that, where required, they are intended to be the means by which compliance is determined. In particular, implementation
plans will be used to set forth the manner in which full compliance with specific requirements will be attained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.5 provides that part 830 shall be enforced according to the provisions of 10 CFR part 820, published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 17, 1993 (58 FR 43680). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.6 requires that records be maintained such that compliance with the provisions of part 830 can be substantiated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.7 mandates the use of a graded approach when so indicated in a subpart. It also requires the documentation
of the reasons for the selection of specific actions to be taken pursuant to the graded approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 830.100, Scope of subpart, provides a statement of general applicability for Subpart A of part 830. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Quality Assurance Requirements'' section, 830.120, mandates the development and implementation of a formalized
quality assurance program. To ensure full compliance, DOE will review and approve contractor-proposed quality
assurance programs and will evaluate contractor performance against the approved program including any modifications
made or directed by DOE. Because of the clarification concerning implementation plans, DOE has decided to delete
the proposed distinction between new and existing facilities. However, DOE does not expect to authorize the operation
of any new facility unless a quality assurance program is approved and full compliance with &sect;830.120 is assured.

A. Review Under Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today's regulatory action has been determined to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866,
``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was subject to review
under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). There were no substantive changes
between the draft submitted to OIRA and today's action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft of today's action and any other documents submitted to OIRA for review have been made a part of the rulemaking
record and are available for public review in the Department's Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1000 Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585 between the hours of 9 and 4, Monday through Friday, telephone (202) 586&hyph;6020.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;354, which requires preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that is likely to have significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. DOE certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities; therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No new information collection or record keeping requirements are imposed by this final rule. Information collection
provisions of this rule were previously approved under OMB Control No. 1910&hyph;0300. Accordingly, no Office of
Management and Budget clearance is required by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1990 (44 U.S.C. 3501

D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent a major Federal action having significant
impact on the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1959 [42 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 (1976)], or the Council of Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and DOE guidelines (10
CFR part 1021), and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment
pursuant to NEPA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12612, 52 FR 41685 (October 30, 1987) requires that regulations, rules, legislation, and any other
policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National
Government and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government.
If there are sufficient substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the National Government
and the States, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of Government, the Executive
Order requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing
a policy action. This final rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutional interests or traditional
functions of States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Executive Order 12778 instructs each agency to adhere to certain requirements in promulgating new regulations
and reviewing existing regulations. These requirements, set forth in sections 2(a) and (b)(2), include eliminating
drafting errors and needless ambiguity, drafting the regulations to minimize litigation, providing clear and certain
legal standards for affected conduct, and promoting simplification and burden reduction. Agencies are also instructed
to make every reasonable effort to ensure that the regulation specifies clearly any preemptive effect, effect on
existing Federal law or regulation, and retroactive effect; describes any administrative proceedings to be available
prior to judicial review and any provisions for the exhaustion of such administrative proceedings; and defines key
terms. The DOE certifies that today's rule meets the requirements of sections 2(a) and (b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.

and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, that requires modification of the fuel crossfeed low level dump system shutoff. This
amendment is prompted by an FAA determination that, in the event of a failure of the number 2 bus tie relay and the subsequent
loss of the number 2 electrical power source, an all-engine flameout event could occur due to fuel starvation during
or shortly after a fuel dumping operation. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the fuel
dump system shutoff due to a failure of the number 2 DC bus electrical relay and the subsequent loss of the number 2 electrical
power source.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD), that is
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1993 (58 FR 64708). That action proposed to require modification of the fuel crossfeed low level dump
system shutoff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed compliance time of 15 months to modify the fuel crossfeed low level dump system
shutoff be extended to 24 months to coincide with regularly scheduled ``C'' checks. The commenter states that a compliance
time of 24 months would allow operators some latitude to schedule the accomplishment of this modification. The FAA
concurs with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time for the modification requirement so that the modification
can be performed at a maintenance base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained
maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Extending the compliance time by 9 additional months will
not adversely affect safety since the interim procedures [via a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM)] required
by AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;06, Amendment 39&hyph;8392 (57 FR 47570, October 19, 1992) will detect electrical malfunctions
that may render the automatic fuel dump termination feature inoperative. Therefore, paragraph (a) of the final rule
has been revised to specify a compliance time of 24 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 98 McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 and MD&hyph;11F airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 43 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will
take approximately 6 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is
$55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $5,688 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $258,774, or $6,018 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

with ones made of Inconel 718 material, and eventual replacement of all H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain
critical locations with Inconel 718 material bolts. This amendment is prompted by reports of cracked and fractured
H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations of the airframe structure. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent the failure of attachment bolts in critical locations, which could lead to severe
airframe damage.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 15, 1993 (58 FR 65567). That action proposed to require inspections to detect cracked or fractured H&hyph;11
steel bolts, replacement of discrepant bolts with ones made of Inconel 718 material, and eventual replacement of
all H&hyph;11 steel bolts installed at certain critical locations with bolts made of Inconel 718 material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that the applicability of the proposal be revised to exclude Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes.
These commenters state, and the manufacturer has confirmed, that these airplanes were delivered without H&hyph;11
steel bolts installed. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service
Bulletin 747&hyph;51&hyph;2048, Revision 1, dated January 27, 1994, which excludes Model 747&hyph;400 series
airplanes from the effectivity listing. Since these airplanes were not delivered with H&hyph;11 bolts, they are
not subject to the addressed unsafe condition. The FAA has revised the final rule to exclude Model 747&hyph;400 series
airplanes from the applicability, and to reference this latest revision of the service bulletin as an additional
source of appropriate service information. Additionally, the FAA has revised the economic impact information,
below, to reflect the exclusion of Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 60 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 7 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take an average of 15 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed inspection actions, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection action of this AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $5,775, or $825 per airplane, per inspection cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take an average of 240 work hours per airplane to accomplish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed bolt replacement action, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Required parts would cost approximately $11,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total cost impact of the proposed replacement action of this AD on U.S. operators is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $169,400, or $24,200 per airplane. (This estimate assumes that H&hyph;11 steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bolts are found at all affected locations.) Accomplishment of this replacement action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminates the repetitive inspection requirement; therefore the accomplishment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement will result in a reduction in costs to affected operators of $275 per airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per inspection cycle that will no longer be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplishment of the actions proposed in this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions. However, in actual practice, these actions for the most part would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled airplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54353), EPA issued a notice which announced that Micro Flo Co., P.O. Box 5948, Lakeland, FL
33807, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 3F4196) to EPA proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180, under section 408 of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, by establishing a regulation to exempt from the requirement
of a tolerance residues of the following biochemical pesticide plant floral volatile attractant compounds: cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamyl alcohol, 4-methoxy cinnamaldehyde, 3-phenyl propanol, 4-methoxy phenethyl alcohol, indole, and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene
on the following raw agricultural commodities: the following field crops_alfalfa, clover, cotton, dandelion,
peanuts (including hay), rice, sorghum (milo), soybeans, sunflower, sweet potatoes, and wheat; the following vegetable
crops_ asparagus, beans (including forage hay), beets, carrots, celery, cole crops (cabbage, broccoli, brussels
sprouts, cauliflower), collards (kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, kohlrabi), corn, fresh (field, sweet, pop,
seed), corn fodder and forage, chinese cabbage, cowpeas, cucurbitis (cucumbers, squash, pumpkin), egg plant, endive
(escarole), horseradish (radish, rutabagas, turnip roots), leafy greens (spinach, swiss chard), lettuce (head
leaf), okra, parsley, parsnip, peas, peas with pods, peppers, potatoes, sugar beets, tomatoes; the following tree
fruit, berry and nut crops_almonds, apples, apricots, berries (blackberry, boysenberry, dewberry, loganberry,
raspberry), blueberry, cherry, citrus (grapefruit, kumquat, lemon, lime, orange, tangelo, and tangerine) cranberry,
grapes, melons, (watermelon, honeydew, crenshaw, cantaloupe, casaba, persian), nectarines, pears, pecans, peaches,

, a pesticidal bait. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has classified the seven floral attractants as biochemical pesticides based on their nontoxic mode of
action and the natural occurrence of the components. The Agency notes that with the exception of 4-methoxy phenethyl
alcohol and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene, the various components are used in the flavor and fragrance industry and are
considered generally recognized as safe by the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No residue chemistry data were required. The Agency has taken into consideration the use pattern of the end-use product,
its formulation, and the low application rate of the subject plant floral volatile attractants from the end-use product.
The application rate of the subject attractants would be less than or equal to 20 grams of each per acre per application,
given a maximum label rate of 5 applications of 10 pounds of Corn Rootworm Bait

Based on the information cited above and the conditions of use, the Agency has determined that the establishment of
an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance in 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance
is established as set forth below.

, file written objections and/or a request for a hearing with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20.
The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for
the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27.
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested. 40 CFR 178.32.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Because certain aspects of the procedures adopted by the FCC for filing and acceptance of 220&hyph;222 MHz license
applications were appealed, non-nationwide licensees were granted an extension of 120 days from the final disposition
of the appeal to construct their systems and place them in operation. The relevant appeal was settled. Upon motion
by affected licensees, the Private Radio Bureau has adopted this Order granting an extension of time through December
2, 1994, for non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensees to construct their systems and place them in operation. This
action provides affected licensees with necessary time to account for the unanticipated prompt appellate finality
that followed a previous period of uncertainty with respect to equipment purchasing, financing, system construction
and management contracts.

By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On July 30, 1992, certain aspects of the Commission's procedures for filing and acceptance of 220&hyph;222 MHz
license applications were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, we conditioned all grants of 220&hyph;222 MHz licenses upon the outcome of this appeal. We granted each
non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz licensee, regardless of its initial authorization date, an automatic extended
period of 120 days from the date of the appeal's final disposition by the courts, to construct and place its licensed
facilities in operation.

3. On February 15, 1994, the law firm of Keller and Heckman, on behalf of various 220 MHz licensees, requested that the
Commission extend the time to construct non-nationwide 220&hyph;222 MHz facilities from 120 days after resolution
of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to 240 days after its resolution. Keller and Heckman based this request on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The unanticipated prompt appellate finality achieved by settlement of this matter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The probable inability of 220&hyph;222 MHz equipment vendors to accommodate, within a 120-day timeframe, the
thousands of equipment orders that are likely to be placed with the advent of a settlement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The likelihood that such an extension will result in the provision of 220&hyph;222 MHz local service to the public
more quickly than through the automatic cancellation of existing licenses followed by the selection of new licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Keller and Heckman indicated that most 220&hyph;222 MHz non-nationwide licensees ``have been highly reluctant
to commit to decisions on equipment purchasing, financing, system construction and management contracts while
the air of uncertainty as to license retention created by the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
case''
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 continues to prevail. Keller and Heckman stated that the requested extension would allow licensees the requisite
time needed to address these matters.

authorized on or before the release date of this Order must construct their facilities and place them in operation

 This rule amends Standard No. 213, Child Restraint Systems, to create an exception to the requirement that a restraint
must not change its adjustment position during dynamic compliance testing. A change in adjustment positions of a
rear-facing restraint, i.e., infant restraint, is permitted subject to a requirement intended to ensure that the
design allowing such movement will not injure the infant.

The amendment will permit the production of restraints specially designed for infants with apnea or other breathing
problems. To facilitate breathing by these infants, these restraints allow infants to ride in the reclined position
under normal driving conditions. However, when the restraint is subjected to the forces of a frontal vehicle crash,
a portion of the restraint adjusts so that the infants move into an upright, rear-facing position. In this position,
the crash forces are spread over the full torso and the back of the infant's head is supported, thus reducing the chance
of injury.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the requirement in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,''
that a child restraint with adjustable (reclinable) positions must not change its adjustment position during dynamic
testing (S5.1.1(b)). The purpose of the requirement is to prevent a child's fingers or limbs from being caught between
the shifting parts of the restraint. Today's rule permits a change in adjustment positions of a rear-facing restraint
system, i.e., infant restraint, provided that the restraint meets a requirement intended to ensure such movement
will not injure the child. The amendments made by this document were proposed in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
published on May 26, 1993 (58 FR 30134). NHTSA commenced this rulemaking action in response to a petition for rulemaking
from Century Products Company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions adopted in today's document are substantially similar to those NHTSA proposed in the May 1993 NPRM.
This rule permits an infant restraint to have a means for repositioning the seating surface of the restraint that allows
an infant to move from a reclined position to an upright position during a frontal crash. To protect the infant during
that change in adjustment position, the rule regulates exposed openings in the restraint structure. No opening that
is exposed and is larger than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) before the testing is permitted to become smaller during the movement
of the seating surface relative to the restraint system as a whole. This rule also requires that the printed instructions
accompanying each rear-facing child restraint system that has a means for repositioning the seating surface of the
system include a warning against impeding the ability of the restraint to change adjustment position.

Infant Restraints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An infant restraint is a child restraint system, except a car bed, that positions a child so that the child faces toward
the rear of the motor vehicle. Most infant restraints are conventional rear-facing seats which are designed for infants
only, and are intended to be installed so that the infant faces the rear of the vehicle. There are other child restraints
that are convertible into two different modes. In one mode, these restraints are rear-facing so that they can be used
by infants. In the other mode, these restraints are forward-facing so that they can be used by toddlers. (When the term
``infant restraint'' is used below, it refers both to infant seats which are exclusively for infants and to the infant
mode of convertible child restraints.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Infant restraints are designed to meet infants' particular physical needs. An infant cannot be seated in a completely
upright position since its neck muscles are not strong enough to enable the infant to hold its head upright. An infant
restraint must be designed, therefore, so that it supports the infant's spine and head in a partially inclined position.
At the same time, an infant must be positioned sufficiently upright and rear-facing so that in a crash, the forces are
spread evenly across the infant's back and shoulders, the strongest part of an infant's body. Further, an infant restraint
positions the back of the child's head against the restraint's seating surface in a crash. This helps to prevent severe
neck injuries.

Century's Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Century submitted its petition because it wishes to produce an infant restraint that, under normal driving conditions,
would allow the infant to lie on its back in a more reclined position than is possible in current infant restraints,
with the infant's head nearest the front of the vehicle and its feet nearest the rear of the vehicle. To provide proper
protection in a frontal crash, a portion of the infant seat, including the surface on which the infant is resting, would
change position by rotating upwards and toward the front of the vehicle so that the child would be rear-facing and almost
upright. As a result, the crash forces would be applied to and spread across the infant's neck and shoulders. In the
almost upright mode, the restraint would provide occupant protection similar to that provided by infant seats lacking
the capability of dynamic readjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner described three ways in which safety could be improved if infant seats were allowed to change adjustment
positions in a crash. First, the petitioner believes designing an infant seat so that it changes adjustment positions
during a frontal crash could reduce the crash forces imposed on the child. The movement due to the change in position
could help dissipate the stored kinetic energy during the initial stage of a frontal crash (i.e., when the momentum
of the child and rear-facing seat are causing them to attempt to move toward the front of the vehicle). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second improvement in safety relates to what Century stated was the primary advantage of the new seat. The petitioner
believed the seat would enable a child to travel in a more reclined position than is possible with current infant seats.
The petitioner said that this would benefit premature, apnea-prone infants, and infants with other breathing problems.
Included in Century's petition was the petitioner's public service message on ``positional apnea.'' It explains
the problems that infants with positional apnea have when riding in current infant restraints:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Positional Apnea is a breathing difficulty that could occur when very small infants are positioned in an upright angle
in infant products such as car seats, car beds, strollers, carriers, swings, etc. Because of their tiny bodies and
weak necks, small infants are in danger of Positional Apnea. If the angle of the child in the infant product is too steep,
the infant's head may fall forward far enough to choke off his/her air supply. Depending on the positioning of the child
in an infant product, the risk to the child may be increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To explain its reasons for believing a change to S5.1.1(b) would help children with apnea, Century submitted articles
and statements from members of the medical community on positional apnea. These materials are fully discussed in
the NPRM. They include a July 1990 policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics on the safe transportation
of premature infants, which states that some infants, particularly premature, low-weight infants, may be subject
to oxygen desaturation when placed in an upright position in infant restraints. Century argued that the articles
indicate a need for new infant restraint designs that are specially designed, such as the infant seat the petitioner
wishes to produce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third advantage of the seat relates to improved positioning of all infants in infant restraints. Infant restraints
are tested by NHTSA for compliance with FMVSS No. 213 on a ``standard seat assembly,'' which is an essentially horizontal
vehicle seat cushion. The ``standard seat assembly'' is specified in S7.3 of the standard. If the vehicle seat cushions
actually being installed in vehicles are not horizontal, but slant downward to the rear, as they do in some newer model
cars, an infant restraint placed on that vehicle seat cushion would be tilted rearward. Thus, an infant riding in the
infant restraint would likely sit more upright than if the infant restraint were placed on a horizontal vehicle seat
cushion. A restraint's back support surface that is too upright might not be able to provide adequate support to the
infant's head and neck. Century said that its new infant restraint would compensate for the effect that a slanting
vehicle seat cushion may have on infant restraints.

The NPRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposed amending S5.1.1 to permit infant restraints to have a means for enabling the seating surface of the
system to adjust during testing so that the restraint's occupant would move from a reclined position to an upright
position. Under the NPRM, the movement of the seating surface during testing, relative to the restraint as a whole,
had to be unidirectional rotation or translation. The NPRM also proposed that no opening in the restraint structure
that is exposed and is larger than 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) before the testing shall become smaller during the testing as a
result of the movement of the seating surface relative to the restraint as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were expressly sought on the following issues. First, whether movement of the seating surface during dynamic
testing should be permitted for child restraints other than infant restraints. Second, whether movement during
dynamic testing must occur only unidirectionally in a rotational or translational motion. Third, whether there
should be greater leeway in how exposed openings may close. In addition, the NPRM sought comments on whether a change
in infant restraint adjustment position during a sudden deceleration should be permitted as a potential way of protecting
children from injury that might otherwise result from an air bag impacting the child restraint during a crash.

Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA received eight comments on the NPRM. Commenters were Century, Ford, the American Academy of Pediatrics, Advocates
for Highway and Auto Safety, Congressman Thomas C. Sawyer of Ohio, and three private individuals interested in child
seat safety (Messrs. Jerome Koziatek, Donald Friedman and Jonathan Sebring).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All the commenters, except Mr. Sebring, generally believed motion in a restraint system will benefit safety. Mr.
Koziatek believed that changes in vehicle interiors (e.g., air bags, three-point belts, more restricted occupant
space) have made it more difficult for child restraints to protect the child occupant, and that permitting motion
will help attenuate the deceleration forces in a crash in a manner that is more beneficial than other means. (He did
not specify those other means.) Century emphasized its belief that permitting motion will enable the manufacture
of restraints that can transport children with positional apnea.

In the more medically correct position. That is, by transporting the child in a more horizontal position, those seven
percent of children born that are considered low birth weight will be at a lower risk.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters expressed qualified support. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety believed the idea of movement
in a rear-facing child restraint ``has much to recommend it.'' However, the commenter was concerned about possible
adverse side effects resulting from the change in adjustment position, such as from abrupt movement of the restraint,
and movement that can cause injury to fingers. Similarly, Ford said it ``supports the concept that allowing controlled
change of adjusted position during dynamic testing may reap safety benefits, but suggests that further evaluation
of the concept be conducted.'' Ford expressed concern about the effect of an abrupt cessation of the movement of the
child restraint, such as if the restraint were to rotate into the instrument panel. ``An abrupt stop to the rotation
of the restraint, for example, could result in significant dummy neck tension.'' The American Academy of Pediatrics
stated that it supports NHTSA's efforts to amend Standard 213 to allow for the development of rear-facing restraints
that can safely transport premature and low-weight infants in a less upright position. However, that commenter said
there should be restrictions on the amount and type of movement that is allowed, because sudden movement from a horizontal
to an upright position can be difficult for a medically fragile child. The Academy was also concerned about protecting
the fingers and hands of both the child occupant and adjacent children from injury from exposed openings.

Mr. Sebring commented on the NPRM after reviewing what he said was a video animation of Century's new restraint exhibited
at a juvenile products show. Mr. Sebring was concerned that a child in a restraint that changes adjustment position
can experience acceleration levels on its chest cavity that are not experienced with current restraints. The commenter
suggested NHTSA adopt a rule that permits motion only after analyzing data from a test dummy that measures G forces,
and specify limits on the G forces that are imposed on a dummy placed in the restraint.

Agency Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is amending S5.1.1(b) of Standard 213 to remove the restriction against an infant restraint's changing adjustment
position during testing. The agency believes safety will not be degraded by this amendment, since a provision has
been adopted to minimize possible safety risks resulting from a restraint's changing adjustment positions in a crash.
That provision relates to the closing of exposed openings. The agency will examine infant restraint accident data
and consider appropriate action if changing the position of an infant restraint's seating surface has any adverse
effect on safety. At present, NHTSA does not know of any information indicating the possibility of a negative safety
impact. In fact, NHTSA believes there are several potential positive impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those positive impacts were discussed in the NPRM as reasons why the agency was reexamining the prohibition against
change of adjustment position during testing. Since the 1970's, when the prohibition was adopted, more has been learned
about the proper positioning of apnea-prone children in car seats. Century documented the need for infant restraints
that position apnea-prone infants in a more horizontal position. The agency concludes S5.1.1(b) should be amended
so that it does not impede the development of new child seat designs for apnea-prone infants. NHTSA recognizes that
the market for infant restraints that change adjustment positions may extend beyond the parents of apnea-prone children,
and that this may result in a greater number of infants being exposed to the effects of the new type of infant restraint
with its changing adjustment position. However, the agency is unable to estimate the extent of the possible appeal
to the greater population of parents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advocates requested information about ``the number of premature and low-birth weight infants who are at risk because
they are being transported in currently marketed child restraints.'' According to the Vital and Health Statistics
Report of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 6.9 percent of the 3,910,000 births in 1988 were of low birth
weight (``low birth weight'' is defined as a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces)). That is a total
of 267,790 babies. In 1989, the low birth rate increased to 7 percent, resulting in 282,868 low-birth weight babies
out of 4,040,972 babies.

Another factor that changed since the 1970's is the change in vehicle seat designs that have occurred in recent years.
As explained above and in the NPRM, vehicle seat designs have changed such that infants typically are positioned more
upright in infant restraints placed in current model vehicles than in vehicles of the late 1970's and early 1980's.
A restraint that enables the child to ride in a more reclined position than a conventional infant restraint could enhance
the transportation of infants generally, and could benefit apnea-prone children in particular.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also considered the interaction of infant restraints with air bags in deciding to issue this rule. Ford
stated that it is possible that an infant restraint could be developed that would reduce the risk of interaction with
an air bag, if the restraint could keep the infant in a supine position below the level of air bag inflation, prior to
movement to a more vertical position. However, Ford also noted it is possible that an air bag would likely begin to inflate
before or shortly after a movable rear-facing infant restraint would begin to move into a more vertical position.
``Movement of the infant seat to a vertical position would likely be somewhat limited by the inflating air bag.*&blank;*&blank;*''
The American Academy of Pediatrics expressed its desire to see an infant restraint that can be safely used with an air
bag. ``If the opportunity to develop a child restraint that utilizes movement proves to improve this serious incompatibility
problem, we certainly would be in favor of such a device.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While at present there is no infant restraint that can be safely used with an air bag, vehicle and child restraint manufacturers
have undertaken research to develop compatible restraint systems. Ford's comment illustrates that an amendment
to permit motion in infant restraints could provide some of the needed flexibility to vehicle and infant seat manufacturers
to improve present vehicle and infant seat designs to achieve compatibility. While Ford did not seem to believe motion
in an infant seat such as that provided for by this rule would in itself achieve compatibility, NHTSA hopes that air
bag-compatible infant restraints will be developed in the near future. Century has demonstrated the practicability
of a design that can meet both the need of an infant to be upright in a crash and the need to be supine while under normal
driving circumstances. NHTSA believes today's amendment might act as a catalyst for the development of infant seat
designs that use motion to manage crash forces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to Mr. Sebring's concerns that a child in an infant restraint that changes adjustment positions during
a test can experience acceleration levels on its chest cavity that are not experienced with current restraints, no
information was submitted to support this assertion. Further, given that there is no information showing there will
be potential safety problems with restraints that change adjustment position, NHTSA does not agree that this rulemaking
should be delayed pending research on a test dummy that measures G forces experienced by occupants of these restraints.

Forward-Facing Restraints
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted the prohibition against changing adjustment positions during testing to be removed for
all types of child restraints. Century, Ford, and Mr. Koziatek suggested removing the prohibition for forward-facing
toddler restraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided not to permit change in adjustment position for other types of restraints. Today's amendment permits
such change for rear-facing child seats only. In the case of convertible seats with an infant mode, change would be
permitted in the infant mode only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency's reasons for adopting the amendment, discussed in the preceding section, are relevant to infant restraints,
but not other child restraints. This amendment does not eliminate the prohibition for forward-facing child seats
because there is insufficient reason for doing so. In addition to preventing a child's fingers or limbs from being
caught between the shifting parts of the restraint, the prohibition serves to prevent a child seated in a forward-facing
child restraint from submarining (i.e., sliding too far forward and downward, legs first) during the crash. The prohibition
has been an effective and simple approach to accomplishing those purposes. There is no information that weighs in
favor of removing the prohibition for forward-facing restraints, such as information indicating that a change in
adjustment position could protect forward-facing children from injury from an inflating air bag. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Friedman suggested removing the prohibition for car beds. He also suggested S5.1.1 of Standard 213 be amended
to permit ``permanent deformation'' of the interior surface of a restraint as a means of providing crash protection
for the occupant. Mr. Friedman's suggestions are outside the scope of the rulemaking, and have not been adopted by
this rule.

during testing must be unidirectional rotation or translation. Several commenters addressed this issue. Century
requested that the rule permit the child seat to reverse its direction during the dynamic test of Standard 213. According
to the petitioner:

Ford said NHTSA should ``evaluate the risks involved in abrupt cessation of the movement of the child restraint.''
(NHTSA assumes the reference to ``abrupt cessation'' relates to what Ford believed would result from the proposed
requirement that the movement must be unidirectional rotation or translation.) In contrast, Mr. Sebring believed
the motion must be only unidirectional rotation or translation. The commenter believed ``there are obvious bending
moments produced in the occupant's neck as a result of whiplash action which occurs when the restraint returns post-impact
to its original horizontal position.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to adopt the unidirectional requirement. The agency agrees with
Century that it would make sense for the infant restraint to return to its original horizontal position after a crash.
If the restraint did not return to the original position, an apnea-prone infant restrained in the seat would remain
in the upright position, which is the position the child should not be in for any prolonged period of time. Also, having
the restraint return to the supine position may be beneficial in a multiple impact crash if the restraint rotated upright
in the second or subsequent impact. The movement from a supine to a nearly upright position could help dissipate the
stored kinetic energy during the crash because part of the energy of the crash may be consumed by the motion of the restraint
(in changing adjustment position). Part of the energy of the crash may also be consumed by frictional forces of the
restraint's moving parts, e.g., springs and other mechanisms, that may be used to engage the movement of the child
seating surface.

Mr. Sebring's comment in support of a unidirectional requirement accorded with NHTSA's tentative determination
in the NPRM that a unidirectional requirement could minimize possible stresses on the neck of the infant. However,
NHTSA has concluded there is insufficient information on this issue justifying a unidirectional requirement, particularly
in view of the potential benefits (discussed in the preceding paragraph) of permitting an infant restraint to return
to the original horizontal position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Sebring believed that the return of the restraint to the original horizontal position will result in ``obvious
bending moments'' in the occupant's neck ``as a result of whiplash action.'' Information supporting this assertion
is unavailable. To evaluate the claims of Mr. Sebring, NHTSA requested that Century provide a copy of the videotape
that Century presented at the juvenile products show that Mr. Sebring attended. (NHTSA has placed the video Century
provided in NHTSA Docket Number 74&hyph;09; Notice 30.) Contrary to the commenter's description about what he allegedly
saw happening to a dummy restrained in Century's restraint, the video did not show any dummy occupying the displayed
child restraint. NHTSA was unable to clarify Mr. Sebring's comment. The agency repeatedly attempted to contact Mr.
Sebring for information clarifying the references to the videotape and to the ``obvious bending moments'' it appeared
he saw, but NHTSA could not reach Mr. Sebring at his given telephone number, and there was no listing for him in the given
area code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, the agency's evaluation of the film provided by Century did not reveal movement in the child restraint
that would cause ``obvious bending moments'' in the neck of a child occupant. Nevertheless, while there is no information
at this time indicating a safety need to adopt a unidirectional requirement for the motion of the restraint, NHTSA
will monitor accident data to evaluate whether neck injuries are occurring in infant seats that change adjustment
position in a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The American Academy of Pediatrics suggested that there should be some restrictions on the amount and type of movement
allowed.

It is important that moveable parts should not be able to move too easily and should move only upon impact. Sudden movement
from a horizontal to an upright position can be difficult for a medically fragile child and should only occur when absolutely
necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is not specifying limits on the ease with which an infant restraint can change adjustment position. The agency
believes such limits are unnecessary because as a practical matter, a restraint that too easily changes adjustment
position from the supine to the upright position negates the benefits the restraint is designed to provide to apnea-prone
infants. NHTSA believes that manufacturers who wish to market restraints for apnea-prone infants will not design
a restraint that ends up transporting the infants in a position that is too upright for their breathing condition.
Also, NHTSA believes that manufacturers have a commercial incentive to design a suitable threshold force into the
restraint to trigger the release mechanism, since a restraint that too easily changes adjustment positions could
appear unsafe, uncomfortable and thus unattractive to consumers. In any event, NHTSA will also evaluate the performance
of these restraints and monitor accident data on this issue, to see whether a safety need emerges to limit how easily
an infant restraint can change adjustment position.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters addressed the proposal to prohibit openings that are exposed and are at least 1/4 inch in diameter
before the testing from becoming smaller during testing due to the movement of the seating surface relative to the
restraint system as a whole. Most of these commenters supported the proposal. Century requested that openings greater
than 1/4 inch in diameter should be permitted to become smaller if the opening is no smaller than 11/2 inches at the conclusion
of testing. The commenter did not provide information on why that value would be more appropriate than the proposed
value. Since a child or adult seated next to a rotating infant seat can be injured if a hand were caught in an opening whose
diameter were reduced to 11/2 inches, Century's request is denied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On a related matter, the agency wishes to clarify a statement in the NPRM. NHTSA indicated a belief in the NPRM that changes
in child seat designs (from exposed tubular steel frames to molded plastic ones) might have obviated the safety need
for a prohibition against a change in adjustment position. Two commenters did not agree with that statement. The American
Academy of Pediatrics said it was not convinced that the risk of injury to a child's fingers has been removed because
of the type of material from which restraints are presently made. Mr. Sebring said a return to tubular steel frames
could occur in the future, especially since future designs could be patterned after the ``ISO&hyph;FIX,'' a child
restraint system that the European community is developing with standardized features for installation in vehicles.
Mr. Sebring believes features of the ISO&hyph;FIX design could necessitate a return to tubular steel frames, if the
design were eventually used in this country. (He did not specify the features to which he referred.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To clarify the agency's statement, the agency believed that the type of child restraint design made possible through
the use of plastic molded frames might have obviated the need for the requirement in question. However, NHTSA has reconsidered
this issue. The agency concludes that a requirement protecting against injury to fingers and hands due to shifting
child restraint parts is needed to ensure present and future child seat designs do not have dangerous parts that can
trap and injure hands and fingers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety suggested that NHTSA require that the printed instructions accompanying a
rear-facing restraint designed for children with apnea or other breathing problems include information on how these
children should be positioned while being transported in a motor vehicle. That suggestion is beyond the scope of the
NPRM and has not been adopted. Advocates also suggested that NHTSA require that the printed instructions include
information telling the consumer not to impede the ability of the restraint to change adjustment position. The agency
concludes that requiring this information for infant restraints that are designed to change adjustment position
is within the scope of the rulemaking. The information relates to the real-world operation of the restraint in a crash.
This rulemaking, which permits the manufacture of a new type of infant restraint system, rests on NHTSA's conclusion
that the new system can afford adequate crash protection provided that the restraint changes adjustment position
in a crash. If the movement of the restraint's seating surface were to be impeded by the consumer in some manner, the
primary means of crash protection provided by the restraint would be negated. It is crucial that the consumer not impede
the movement of the restraint, and be instructed on the matter. Therefore, such instructions will be required.

This rule is effective 30 days after its publication date. The shorter than usual effective date is based on the effect
of the amendment to relieve design restrictions and facilitate the manufacture of a new type of infant seat. Because
the rule relieves a restriction, there is good cause for making it effective in 30 days.

This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review.'' The agency has considered
the impacts of this rulemaking action and has determined that this action is not ``significant'' within the meaning
of the Department of Transportation's regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has further determined that the
effects of this rulemaking are so minimal that preparation of a full preliminary regulatory evaluation is not warranted.
The agency believes that manufacturers will be minimally affected by this rulemaking because it simply permits new
designs in infant restraints and does not require any design change or impose additional costs on manufacturers.
Manufacturers that do not want to manufacture an infant restraint that can change adjustment positions will not be
affected.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify
that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The agency knows of fourteen
manufacturers of child restraints, seven of which NHTSA considers to be small businesses (including Kolcraft, which
with an estimated 500 employees, is on the borderline of being a small business). These businesses do not comprise
a substantial number of small entities that are affected by this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regardless of the number of small businesses, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on these entities.
The rule will affect manufacturers only if they choose to manufacture an infant restraint that can change adjustment
positions in Standard 213's dynamic test. The amendment may benefit manufacturers by allowing them to manufacture
and sell a new product. However, based on manufacturers' responses to the NPRM, it does not appear that manufacturers
other than Century will manufacture and sell such a product. The amendment may provide benefits to apnea-prone children
by allowing manufacturers to produce an infant restraint that can position these children in a manner more appropriate
for their condition. However, the agency does not have information to estimate those possible benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small organizations and governmental jurisdictions procure infant restraints for programs such as loaner programs.
NHTSA does not believe the costs of infant restraints will be increased by this rule. Thus, these entities will not
be significantly affected by this rule.

This rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under section 103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act (Safety Act; 15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not
adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal
standard, except to the extent that the state requirement imposes a higher level of performance and applies only to
vehicles procured for the State's use. Section 105 of the Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for judicial
review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does
not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may
file suit in court.

 NMFS issues this notification to announce that the summer flounder commercial quota available to the State of Delaware
has been harvested. Vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for the summer flounder fishery may no longer land summer
flounder in the State of Delaware for the remainder of calendar year 1994, unless additional quota becomes available
through a transfer. Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery require publication of this notification
to advise the State of Delaware that its quota has been harvested and to advise vessel and dealer Federal permit holders
that no commercial quota is available for landing summer flounder in the State.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery are found at 50 CFR part 625. The regulations require annual specification
of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the
annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state is described in &sect;625.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The total commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1994 calendar year is set equal to 16,005,560 pounds (7,257,441
kg) (March 7, 1994, 59 FR 10586). The percent allocated to vessels landing summer flounder in Delaware is 0.01779 percent
or 2,847 pounds (1,290.9 kg).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 625.20(d) provides that any overages of the commercial quota landed in any state will be deducted from that
state's annual quota for the following year. In calendar year 1993, a total of 6,403 pounds (2,903 kg) was landed in
Delaware. The amount allocated for Delaware landings in 1993 was 2,197 pounds (996 kg), creating an overage of 4,206
pounds (1,907 kg) that must be deducted from the amount allocated for landings in Delaware during 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 625.21(c) requires the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to monitor state commercial
quotas and to determine when a state commercial quota is harvested. The Regional Director is further required to publish
a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 advising a state and notifying Federal vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a specific date, the
state's commercial quota has been harvested and no commercial quota is available for landing summer flounder in that
state. Because the amount that must be deducted from the Delaware allocation exceeds the amount allocated in 1994,
the Regional Director has determined that the 1994 summer flounder quota allocation for vessels landing in Delaware
has been harvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at &sect;625.4(a)(3) provide that Federal permit holders agree as a condition of the permit not to
land summer flounder in any state that the Regional Director has determined no longer has commercial quota available.
Therefore, effective 0001 hours March 30, 1994, further landings in Delaware by Federally permitted vessels are
prohibited for the remainder of the 1994 calendar year, unless additional quota becomes available through a transfer
and is announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Federally permitted dealers are also advised that, effective the date above, they may not purchase summer flounder
from Federally permitted vessels that land in Delaware for the remainder of the calendar year, or until additional
quota becomes available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule was issued as amendments to regulations governing Cotton Classification Services for Producers
(7 CFR part 28). The proposal was issued on January 31, 1994, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 4257). It proposed the implementation of module averaging, a method by which the accuracy of fiber quality measurements
can be improved. The module averaging procedure would use all the bales from a module or trailer as the testing unit
rather than using a single bale as the test unit. The module averaging procedure has been offered to growers on a voluntary
basis for the past three crop years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary of Agriculture's Advisory Committee on Cotton Marketing recommended that if no significant problems
were encountered during the 1993 classing season, the module averaging procedure be expanded to include all cotton
classed in 1994 and subsequent crop years. For the 1993 expanded voluntary program, there were 242 gins participating
and the production from these gins totaled 3,053,716 bales. This represented 20 percent of the 1993 cotton crop. No
problems of any significance are known to have developed during the 1993 project. In keeping with the advisory committee's
recommendation, AMS proposed that module averaging be applied to all bales classed effective with the 1994 cotton
crop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments regarding this proposal were accepted from January 31, 1994, through March 2, 1994. Comments were
received from individuals and organizations representing several segments of the cotton industry including producers,
ginners, warehousers, merchants, cooperatives, national and international trade associations, textile manufacturers,
and others. This broad cross section of the cotton industry, together with a significant number of comments (61) indicates
a strong interest in the module averaging concept throughout the industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The textile manufacturing segment submitted four comments; one from a national organization representing domestic
textile manufacturers, and three from individual firms. All of these comments expressed support for the proposal.
The national organization representing textile manufacturers favored the implementation of the proposal provided
four conditions were met: (1) That at least two tests per bale be made; (2) that the integrity of the module be maintained
by preventing the intermingling of cotton between module test units; (3) that when the module averaging procedure
is used only those measurements that fall within three standard deviations of the average be included in the module
average; and (4) that for the purposes of review classification, all bales from the module be retested. The remaining
three comments all reiterated the suggestion for the use of three standard deviations as a determination for including
bales in the module average. The Agency is currently, and will continue, studying how best to determine the inclusion
or exclusion of bales from the module average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirteen comments were received from the producer segment, including two from national organizations. One national
organization was in favor of the proposal. The other recommended the delay of mandatory implementation until 1995,
and the application of module averaging to length, strength and micronaire measurements only. The remaining comments,
submitted by regional producer organizations and individual producers, were nearly equally divided among those
favoring the proposal and those supporting the module averaging concept, but suggesting the continuation of the
voluntary program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cotton ginning segment, through national and state organizations, and individual ginners, submitted 14 written
comments. The national organization representing cotton ginners encouraged the comprehensive industry review
of the 1993 and 1994 module averaging results and continuation of the voluntary module averaging program. The remaining
comments expressed general support for the module averaging concept but suggested that module averaging be continued
on a voluntary basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A leading national association representing cotton merchants, shippers and exporters of raw cotton opposed the
mandatory implementation of module averaging while supporting the continuation of the voluntary program. The Agency
is currently responding to a separate request from this organization for statistical data pertaining to module averaged
cotton. This organization maintains that further evaluation of the data is necessary prior to the implementation
of mandatory module averaging. The remaining 22 comments received from the merchant segment also requested that
module averaging be continued on a voluntary basis so that the effects of module averaging on cotton marketing can
be further evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three foreign cotton trade organizations submitted comments. These comments all stated that the international
cotton trade was not yet sufficiently knowledgeable about the module averaging concept to favor its use on anything
more than a voluntary basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the views expressed in comments submitted from the various segments of the cotton industry, the Agency
has determined that it is in the public interest to continue with the module averaging program on a voluntary basis.
Such action will provide the cotton industry more time to evaluate the effects of module averaging on cotton marketing.
Accordingly, the proposed rule is withdrawn effective April 5, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) proposes to clarify and update the voluntary shell egg grading regulations
and standards in response to new technology and current practices in the shell egg industry and to conform to statutory
requirements. The proposed revisions would amend existing regulations to define washed ungraded eggs and clarify
the definition of a quality assurance inspector. The proposal would add age and disability as types of prohibited
discrimination in providing grading services. Additionally, the proposal would clarify the type of facilities
and equipment to be supplied to a grader and the method by which cartons of eggs are to be identified. Further revisions
would update grading room requirements to include mechanized shell egg operations and to require rinse water to be
at least as warm as wash water. In addition, the standards for quality of individual shell eggs for B quality in U.S.
Nest-Run grades would be harmonized with the U.S. Standards for Quality of Individual Shell Eggs for B quality, and
the wholesale shell egg grades and weight classes would be deleted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule has been determined to be not-significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been
reviewed by OMB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior
to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMS Administrator has determined that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), because the revisions reflect current industry production and marketing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collection requirements that appear in &sect;56.17(b) and &sect;56.37 to be amended by the proposed
rule have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget and assigned OMB Control No. 0581&hyph;0128,
under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Periodically the Poultry Division of AMS reviews its existing regulations. As a result of a review, it was determined
that several revisions were necessary to make the shell egg standards and regulations for grading shell eggs more
useful and efficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grading of shell eggs by the AMS is a voluntary program, provided under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946,
as amended (7 U.S.C. 1621
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and is offered on a fee-for-service basis. The grading program is designed to assist orderly marketing of shell
eggs. Therefore, the standards must keep abreast of new technology and advancements in production and marketing
practices.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To reflect these changes, the Agency is proposing to amend the Regulations Governing the Grading of Shell Eggs and
the U.S. Standards, Grades, and Weight Classes for Shell Eggs in 7 CFR part 56. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would redefine ``quality assurance inspector'' to exclude from this designation a plant owner, manager,
foreman, or supervisor and to clarify that the quality assurance inspector is authorized to examine product. The
revision is necessary to eliminate the possibility that someone with a financial interest in the product or having
managerial responsibilities would be designated as a quality assurance inspector. The revision also would clarify
that examining or sampling product is a primary responsibility required of a quality assurance inspector. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would also define the term ``washed ungraded eggs'' to mean shell eggs which have been washed but not subject
to any grading or segregation for quality. This addition is necessary to facilitate the trading, certification,
and identification of shell eggs from processing facilities where shell eggs move continuously from laying house
to processing facilities without being graded. Such shell eggs cannot be classified as nest run eggs because they
have been washed and are not intended for consumer sales because they have not been graded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would update the regulations to comply with current statutory requirements regarding providing grading
services and licensing graders without discrimination due to age or disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facilities and equipment which the applicant furnishes the grader would be revised to include other facilities
and equipment as may otherwise be required. As new equipment has been developed and installed in official plants,
additional items have been required to perform normal grading activities. The proposal would specifically require
the applicant to provide any adequate facilities and equipment necessary to perform grading activities as changes
in technology and production practices dictate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would revise the regulations to comply with the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990, which requires
nutrition labeling on most foods that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would revise the existing method of identifying cartons to require that each officially identified
carton of shell eggs be lot numbered on either the carton or the consumer package. The current regulations specify
that the cartons shall be lot numbered on the carton or the tape used to seal the carton. The shell egg industry does not
use tape to seal cartons in their current production practices. This revision would update the regulations to reflect
current production practices and in addition provide flexibility to accommodate future changes that the industry
may devise for officially identifying shell eggs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposal would revise the minimum facility and operating requirements for shell egg grading and
packing plants by updating grading room requirements. The current regulations describe hand-candling operations
which are out-of date because almost all shell egg processing is done mechanically. Regulations are needed which
define the grading room requirements of a mechanized shell egg processing operation. The proposed revision will
specifically define the requirements of a mechanized shell egg operation while providing the flexibility to approve
the acceptability of all grading rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shell egg cleaning operations also would be revised to require that the temperature of the water used to spray rinse
shell eggs be at least as warm as the water used to wash the shell eggs. The current regulations require that washed shell
eggs be spray rinsed with warm water. This revision would specify that ``warm'' means at least the temperature of the
water used to wash the shell eggs and would also bring the regulations in line with current washing and sanitizing practices
which help reduce bacterial contamination of shell eggs. If shell eggs are subjected to a sanitizing spray rinse which
is colder than the water used to wash them, the probability of bacterial contamination increases because the cold
water causes the shell contents to contract which allows contaminants to be drawn through the shell of the egg. Additionally,
the revisions would specifically authorize the National Supervisor to approve methods of sanitizing shell eggs
other than the normal spray rinse method. This revision will provide the flexibility to accommodate future changes
in the technology of sanitizing shell eggs and to adapt to new waste management requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to delete U.S. Wholesale Grades and Weight Classes for Shell Eggs. This is necessary because
wholesale grades are difficult to understand and are virtually unused. Almost all shell eggs moving in commerce today
are sold on the basis of the U.S. Consumer Grades, U.S. Nest-Run Grades, company approved specifications, or sold
without certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to revise the existing standards for B quality in U.S. Nest-Run Grades for shell eggs by allowing
shell eggs with pronounced ridges and thin spots to be included in the maximum percentage tolerance permitted for
B quality. The standard for B quality currently defines abnormal in part as exhibiting pronounced ridges and thin
spots. The proposed revision would provide uniformity between the B quality description for U.S. Nest-Run Grades
and the standards for B quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 4, 1994, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Energy Efficiency Standards for eight
appliance types (59 FR 10464). As part of the analysis supporting that Notice, the Department prepared an Environmental
Assessment (DOE/EA&hyph;0819), which was printed within Volume I of the Technical Support Document that was prepared
for that rulemaking proposal. Today's action makes publically available the Finding of No Significant Impact that
had been prepared for that Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment. It is printed in its entirety.

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, the National Appliance
Energy Conservation Act of 1987, and the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, prescribes
energy conservation standards for certain major household appliances, and requires the Department of Energy (DOE)
to administer an energy conservation program for these products. Based on an Environmental Assessment (EA), DOE/EA&hyph;0819,
DOE has determined that the proposal of any of the candidate amended energy efficiency standards for the eight appliances
would not be a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). Therefore, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is not
required, and the Department is issuing this finding of no significant impact (FONSI).

Description of the Proposed Action:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed action is the establishment of revised energy conservation standards for room air conditioners, water
heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters and fluorescent
lamp ballasts, and to consider standards for televisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental Impacts:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EA evaluates the environmental impacts of a range of new candidate energy conservation standards for eight types
of household appliances. The results are presented for each potential standard level for each of the eight appliance
types. Each potential standard level is an alternative action, and the environmental impacts of each alternative
are compared to what would be expected to happen if no new standards for each product were finalized, i.e., the ``no
action'' alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The main environmental concern is emissions from fossil-fueled electricity generation. Most of the design options
for the eight appliances would result in decreased electricity use and, therefore, a reduction of power plant emissions.
The proposed efficiency standards would generally decrease air pollution by decreasing future energy demand. The
greatest decreases in air pollution would be for sulfur oxides, listed in equivalent weight of sulfur dioxide, or
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Reductions of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide would also occur and are listed by weight of NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, respectively. Design options for many of the appliances (i.e., gas and oil water heaters, gas pool heaters, direct
heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, and gas ranges and ovens) would also reduce in-home fuel consumption, resulting
in lower in-home emissions from fuel-burning appliances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the quantity of raw materials used per appliance would remain relatively constant, in most scenarios increased
initial prices from standards are expected to reduce slightly the number of appliances sold, which would result in
small decreases in the total amount of raw materials used. The main effect of this decreased appliance production
would be the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decreases from avoided fuel burning at power plants. The environmental contribution from reduced steel production
is not included in the estimates for net SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, any reduction would possibly be beneficial to the quality of surface water. Since the total amount of particulates
emitted would decrease, it is very likely that fewer particulates would reach the surface water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 and NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would have other beneficial effects on the environment. The resultant improvement to air quality and the decreased
potential for acid rain formation could help improve the quality of wetlands and fish and wildlife as well as aid in
the preservation of historical and archaeological sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduced in-home fuel consumption of gas or oil would decrease the impact of combustion on indoor air quality. Indoor
air problems are usually due to a combination of factors, including a tight house envelope, insufficient ventilation
for cooking appliances, presence of sources such as cigarette smokers or formaldehyde-containing products, and
radon diffusion from soil. In comparison to the above factors, and because fuel-burning appliances are normally
vented to the outside, the projected changes in home fuel-burning appliance use is expected to have little effect
on indoor air quality.

Determination:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Based upon the EA, DOE has determined that the proposal of any of the candidate amended energy-efficiency standards
for room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens,
pool heaters, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and television sets would not consitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of NEPA. Therefore, an EIS for the proposed action
is not required.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FDIC is proposing to rescind section 304.6 of its regulations, which currently requires all insured banks, with
the exception of insured bankers' banks, to give the FDIC prior notice of planned rapid growth as a result of any ``special
funding plan or arrangement.'' For purposes of this requirement, such a funding plan is an effort to increase the assets
of a bank through the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation
of brokers or affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits); the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside
a bank's normal trade area; or secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rescission would lessen the regulatory burden on banks which are currently required to comply as well
with the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action rule, both of which were designed in
part to address the same risks resulting from rapid growth. The brokered deposit regulation was mandated by the Financial
Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) and amended to conform to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The prompt corrective action rule was mandated by FDICIA.
The rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, but was authorized by the FDIC's general regulatory powers.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although rapid growth is not necessarily an indicator of unsafe or unsound banking practices, and many banks have
been able to manage rapid growth safely, rapid growth does present special risks to a bank (and to the FDIC's insurance
fund). Because these risks warrant special monitoring, the FDIC adopted a rule requiring advance notice to the FDIC
of planned rapid growth. That provision of the FDIC's regulations, 12 CFR 304.6, known as ``the rapid growth rule,''
states that an insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets
by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC
regional director for supervision in writing at least 30 days before the implementation of the special funding plan
or arrangement. A special funding plan or arrangement is defined as any effort to increase the assets of a bank through
(1) the solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from or through the mediation of brokers or
affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits), (2) the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's
normal trade area (depending upon the circumstances, these may be insured brokered deposits) or (3) secured borrowings,
including repurchase agreements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In regulating rapid growth, the rapid growth rule in part overlaps both the FDIC's brokered deposit regulation, 12
CFR 337.6, and its prompt corrective action regulation, 12 CFR 308.200 ff. and 325.101 ff. Should the rapid growth
rule be rescinded, the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations will be the principal means by which
rapid growth will be regulated. For this reason, in deciding whether to rescind the rapid growth rule, the FDIC examined
the rationale and history behind all three regulations, to see if the FDIC's safety-and-soundness concerns will
be met even if the rapid growth rule is rescinded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rapid growth rule, adopted in 1990, replaced a regulation that called for the reporting of fully insured brokered
deposits and fully insured deposits placed directly by other depository institutions. In the preamble to the proposed
rapid growth rule, the FDIC stated that its intention was to broaden the prior regulation's focus from brokered deposits
to all kinds of rapid growth, including brokered deposits:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since a bank may obtain its funding from a variety of sources in addition to brokered deposits, the FDIC believes that
any effort to monitor and control rapid growth in insured banks should not focus solely or even principally on brokered
deposits. Instead, the focus should be on rapid growth 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
as an indication of the need for close monitoring and supervisory oversight.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
an insured bank may not undertake any special funding plan or arrangement designed to increase its assets by more than
nine percent during any consecutive three-month period without first notifying the appropriate FDIC regional director
for supervision in writing at least 30 days in advance of the implementation of the special funding plan or arrangement.
For purposes of this requirement, a special funding plan or arrangement is any effort to rapidly increase the assets
of the bank by any means.

at 13695. The final rule changed the nine percent to 7.5 percent, making the rule more stringent in that respect, but
it narrowed the scope of the rule by making the notice necessary only if there was 7.5 percent growth resulting from
one or more of the following activities: (1) The solicitation and acceptance of fully insured deposits obtained from
or through the mediation of brokers or affiliates (that is, insured brokered deposits); (2) the solicitation of fully
insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area (this category would include insured brokered deposits); or
(3) secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements. Thus, while it is not the sole aim of the rapid growth rule
to curb the rapid growth that may result from the acceptance of brokered deposits, controlling a bank's acceptance
of brokered deposits is one of the primary aims of that rule.

Although the rapid growth rule was not mandated by any statute, the history of the present brokered deposit regulation
involves two statutes, FIRREA and FDICIA. In 1989, FIRREA amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act), prohibiting
an undercapitalized institution from accepting funds obtained, directly or indirectly, by or through any deposit
broker for deposit into one or more deposit accounts except upon specific application to, and waiver of the prohibition
by, the FDIC. Section 224 of FIRREA, adding section 29 to the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831f. In addition to deposits obtained
through the mediation of third-party brokers, the definition of ``brokered deposits'' included deposits on which
an institution offers or has agreed to pay rates of interest that are ``significantly'' higher than the prevailing
rates of interest offered by other depository institutions with the same type of charter in the first institution's
normal market area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two years later, the FDI Act was amended again. This time, FDICIA rewrote section 29 of the Act to restrict the acceptance
of brokered deposits by certain institutions on the basis of their capital levels. Section 301 of FDICIA, amending
section 29 of the FDI Act and adding section 29A thereto, 12 U.S.C. 1831f, 1831f-1. According to FDICIA and the brokered
deposit regulation implementing it, 12 CFR 337.6, undercapitalized institutions may not accept brokered deposits
at all, and adequately capitalized institutions must obtain a waiver from the FDIC before they can accept brokered
deposits. Further, FDICIA limits the interest rates which adequately capitalized institutions can pay on brokered
deposits. Well-capitalized insured depository institutions, however, can accept, renew or roll over brokered
deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the FDIC, and without being limited in the interest rates they can pay.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these restrictions on brokered deposits, FDICIA also established a comprehensive regulatory scheme
for insured depository institutions based on their capital levels. Section 131 of FDICIA, adding section 38 to the
FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1831o. Under the ``prompt corrective action'' provisions of FDICIA, the statute places severe
constraints on what undercapitalized institutions can do, including severe restrictions on asset growth. As explained
in the regulation which implements section 131 of FDICIA, 12 CFR 308.200 ff. and 325.101 ff., and which took effect
on December 19, 1992, as soon as a bank receives notice, or is deemed to have received notice, that it is undercapitalized,
significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, the bank must restrict the growth of its assets
as set forth in section 38(e)(3) of the FDI Act. That section of the Act states that an undercapitalized insured depository
institution shall not permit its average total assets during any calendar quarter to exceed its average total assets
during the preceding calendar quarter unless: (1) The appropriate Federal banking agency has accepted the institution's
capital restoration plan; (2) any increase in total assets is consistent with the plan; and (3) the institution's
ratio of tangible equity to assets increases during the calendar quarter at a rate sufficient to enable the institution
to become adequately capitalized within a reasonable time. 12 U.S.C. 1831o(e)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the above statutes and regulations, the FDIC is considering whether there is a continuing need for the rapid
growth rule. Under the rule, the FDIC, upon being informed by a bank that it is about to undergo rapid growth, can engage
the institution in a dialog as to whether such growth would be prudent and should be pursued. Under the brokered deposit
and prompt corrective action regulations, restrictions on brokered deposits and rapid growth attach automatically
to certain banks having an insufficient capital level. Thus, although the rapid growth rule operates somewhat differently
from the brokered deposit and prompt corrective action regulations, the rapid growth rule may no longer be necessary
given the existence of those other two regulations. For this reason, the FDIC is proposing that the rapid growth rule
be rescinded. This action will ease the regulatory burden on those institutions now subject to all three rules. (If
the FDIC rescinds the rapid growth rule, 12 CFR 304.6, it will also rescind the line on the table in 12 CFR 304.7, which
pertains to the Office of Management and Budget's Control Number for the rapid growth rule.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the rapid growth rule overlaps the brokered deposit regulation and the prompt corrective action regulation,
this overlap is only partial. For instance, rescinding the rapid growth rule would mean that an insured bank would
no longer have to notify the FDIC before it either solicited fully insured deposits outside its normal trade area,
or when it acquired secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, if one or a combination of both of these
activities were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month
period. And while a well-capitalized bank planning to accept brokered deposits on a large scale would no longer have
to inform the FDIC of this fact in advance once the rapid growth rule was rescinded, that bank still must report the amount
of brokered money it has accepted after the fact in its quarterly Report of Condition and Income (``call report'').
Also, deposit brokers must continue to register with the FDIC, and, if requested, could be required to provide data
on the extent of a given bank's brokered deposit activities, under the brokered deposit regulation. If the rapid growth
rule were rescinded, some of the rapid growth resulting from rapid growth rule activities would continue to be detected
by the FDIC's Growth Monitoring System (a system administered by the FDIC's Division of Supervision which identifies
rapid growth over a single quarter in assets or loans and long-term securities and any related deterioration in key
performance ratios), some rapid growth would be controlled or prohibited by the brokered deposit rule, and some would
be prohibited by the regulation on prompt corrective action, but a small part of rapid growth might not be controlled
or detected at all. Thus, comment is sought on whether the rescission of the rapid growth rule would create a regulatory
gap that would have harmful effects on banking.

The FDIC's Board of Directors has concluded that the proposed amendment, if adopted, will not impose a significant
economic hardship on small institutions. The proposal does not establish any recordkeeping or reporting requirements
that necessitate the expertise of specialized accountants, lawyers or managers. The proposal would, in fact, reduce
the reporting requirements to which banks are presently subject. Rescinding the rapid growth rule will afford some
insured banks the opportunity to conduct activities previously prohibited unless notice were given in accordance
with the rule (for instance, the solicitation of fully insured deposits outside a bank's normal trade area, or the
acquisition of secured borrowings, including repurchase agreements, such that one or a combination of both activities
were designed to increase the bank's assets by more than 7.5 percent during any consecutive three-month period).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDIC's Board of Directors therefore certifies pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.

within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
SBA is proposing to repeal its present media or opinion molder policy rule. Under the rule, as proposed, small business
concerns engaged in media activity would be eligible for SBA financial assistance unless they are otherwise ineligible
(such as businesses engaged in illegal activities or in activities that could not be funded by SBA under the Constitution,
and businesses which are not creditworthy). This action is being taken to enable SBA to promote job growth and economic
development by making SBA financial assistance available to a larger number of small business concerns.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
It is timely for the Agency to consider major substantive changes in the media policy rule. Under SBA's present regulatory
policy, no business loan may be made to an applicant engaged in the ``creation, origination, expression, dissemination,
propagation or distribution of ideas, values, thoughts, opinions or similar intellectual property, regardless
of medium, form or content.'' (13 CFR 120.101&hyph;2(b) (1993)). There are several express exceptions to this prohibition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This policy was originally adopted by SBA in 1953 under the authority granted by section 4(d) of the Small Business
Act (15 U.S.C. 633(d)) which authorizes the Agency to ``establish general policies (particularly with reference
to the public interest *&blank;*&blank;*), which shall govern the granting and denial of applications for financial
assistance by the Administration.'' The Reconstruction Finance Agency, the predecessor to SBA, had a similar media
policy rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were three basic reasons for the policy: First, the prohibition is based upon SBA's desire to avoid any possible
accusation that the Government is attempting to control editorial freedom by subsidizing media or communication
for political or propaganda purposes. Second, the Agency has generally sought to avoid Government identification
through its business assistance programs with concerns which might publish or produce matters of a religious or controversial
nature. Third, SBA recognizes that the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of speech and press ought not
to be compromised either by the fear of Government reprisal or by the expectation of Government financial assistance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, Congress has considered the policy and has not objected to SBA's approach. In H.R. Rep. No. 840, 94th
Cong., 2d Sess. 28 (1976), the Subcommittee on SBA Oversight and Minority Enterprise acknowledged that SBA's statutory
duty to assist small business ``must be in balance with supervening First Amendment prohibitions. The Subcommittee
does not believe that the SBA should engage in activities which would necessitate its assumption of a censorship role.
By censorship we mean the ability of SBA to direct a business as to what it can do or cannot do, relative to First Amendment
protected activity, coupled with the power to enforce its will through the use of sanctions. The subcommittee believes
such censorship would exist if SBA were to place in its loan agreements a prohibition against the promulgation of certain
ideas and values, a breach of which would allow the Agency to liquidate the loan.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many individual members of Congress have expressed concern with the substance of SBA's regulations in this area.
Several bills have been introduced to deal with the rule legislatively, although none has been enacted. For example,
S. 2084, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess. (1984), would have abolished the rule except in cases where the financial assistance
would have been used primarily to (1) advance or inhibit religion; (2) threaten the overthrow of organized Government
by unlawful means; or (3) engage in any illegal activity or the dissemination of obscene materials which may be unlawful
in any jurisdiction in which the small concern may operate. S. 2084 also would have required SBA to look at the content
of the publications or communications in making its decision to assist a particular small concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H.R. 1157, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), would have required SBA to hold a hearing, if the business was covered by the
media policy rule, in order to ascertain if the SBA financial assistance would have been (1) adverse or detrimental
to a legitimate public interest, or (2) used primarily to promote or criticize political or religious ideas. This
approach would have led to lengthy hearings on applications for assistance every time the Agency interpreted the
law adversely to an applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA testified on both of these bills and supported a legislative remedy to the problems associated with administration
of the rule. However, no legislation has been forthcoming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In hearings on March 7, 1984, before the House Subcommittee on Export Opportunity and Special Small Business Problems,
which was considering H.R. 1157, an expert in Constitutional Law on the faculty of the George Washington University
Law School testified that the media policy rule was constitutional and was a justifiable approach in light of SBA's
business and financial orientation and limited First Amendment expertise. However, there have been concerns raised
over the years regarding the breadth of the present rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation presently provides a very broad list of ineligible enterprises which includes publishers, producers,
importers, exporters or distributors of all types of communications (such as newspapers, sheet music, posters,
film, tape, theatrical productions, greeting cards, and books), plus transportation concerns limited to the distribution
of such products. Regulatory exceptions have been granted to commercial printing firms, advertising agencies,
technical production facilities (such as a recording studio), and vocational schools. Eligible for assistance
based on administrative interpretations are general merchandise stores which sell books, magazines and newspapers,
and general book, music, record or videotape stores. Not eligible for assistance are specialty book or videotape
stores which sell or rent items in a single or limited subject area. The rationale underlying the distinction between
general and specialty stores has been that a general store covers a broad range of ideas, values and thoughts, rather
than a particular or narrow set of ideas or values. SBA no longer regards this distinction as a proper basis for determining
eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA is well aware that small media concerns often have difficulty in raising capital or borrowing money. The media
policy rule applicable to the financing of business loans has not been applicable to assistance provided by small
business investment companies (SBICs) which are licensed by SBA. Thus, SBICs are permitted to help businesses engaged
in the media. The policy surrounding SBIC assistance to media concerns is similar to the approach taken by the Congress
in funding broadcasting through the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting. SBICs operate within SBA regulations,
but their transactions with small companies are private arrangements which carry no SBA guaranty. Their funding
comes from private, SBA and other nonprivate sources.

SBA also has been making physical injury disaster loans to media concerns and academic schools since 1953, based on
humanitarian grounds. The disaster loan program attempts to restore to an injured party that which was lost due to
circumstances beyond its control. No distinction is made for eligibility purposes between media and non-media concerns
for physical disaster loans, but economic injury disaster loans are subject to the limitations of the media policy
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes that the assistance it presently makes available under the exceptions to the media rule and under the
SBIC and disaster programs are not sufficient to assist small businesses in the media industries which are demonstrably
in need of increased aid. Accordingly, SBA is proposing to change its policy so as to make assistance available, under
the 7(a) business, economic injury disaster and development company loan programs, to media concerns which are otherwise
eligible for such assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While SBA is proposing to repeal the present rule primarily in order to make assistance available to a larger universe
of small businesses, it is not unmindful of the implications of a total reversal of the policy. It has considered whether
the policy determinations which where the underpinnings of the former rule should be maintained. After careful review,
SBA is persuaded that repeal is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revision of the present rule which would attempt to differentiate among media businesses on the basis of business
activity likely would be challenged in court. There is a risk that such proposed revision would be found unconstitutional.
Keeping the Government from becoming involved with controversial speech may be a worthy goal, but it arguably puts
the Government in the position of allocating benefits with reference to the content of speech. This type of decision
could be held by courts to be in conflict with the First Amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SBA believes that it present regulatory apparatus and administrative practice are sufficient to protect the public
interest. In this regard, the present credit criteria under which applications for such assistance are reviewed
and the prohibition on funding illegal activities should be sufficient to provide the desired level of protection.

SBA certifies that this proposed rule, if promulgated in final form, will not constitute a significant regulatory
action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866, since the proposed change is not likely to result in an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more. While the proposed rule is intended to make eligible more media small business
concerns, it is reasonable to assume that SBA will not be requested to process a disproportionate number of additional
media loan applications. For example, in fiscal 1991, 1992 and 1993, respectively, SBA guaranteed 202, 199 and 241
section 7(a) loans to eligible bookstores, advertising agencies, video stores and vocational schools. The aggregate
amounts of the SBA guaranteed portions for those three years for such businesses were, respectively, $27.7, $28.7
and $35.2 million.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain de Havilland
Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes. This proposal would require a revision to
the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise flight crew members that certain cockpit indications may reveal faulty
anti-collision strobe light units, and to provide procedures for subsequent flight crew action. This proposal would
also require a modification that eliminates the need for the AFM revision. This proposal is prompted by reports that
the function of the proximity switch electronics unit (PSEU) may be adversely effected during operation of the white
anti-collision lights. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure correct operation of the PSEU
and its associated systems.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transport Canada Aviation, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe
condition may exist on certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;100 and DHC&hyph;8&hyph;300 series airplanes.
Transport Canada Aviation advises that three field reports indicate that the electrical power supplies of the white
anti-collision lights may develop a fault which produces greater than normal electrical emissions. The cause of
this fault has been attributed to a capacitor failure in some ``Grimes'' strobe light systems. This electromagnetic
interference can adversely affect the operation of the proximity switch electronics unit (PSEU) and its associated
systems. The following occurrences have resulted:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Flashing of the landing gear green locked down advisory lights during cruise;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fluctuation of the cabin pressurization rate needle during cruise;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Retraction and extension of roll and ground spoilers during ground operation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Inoperative nose gear steering subsequent to landing; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Unavailable normal wheel brakes below 35&hyph;40 knots.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Incorrect operation of the PSEU and its associated systems may interfere with or distract the flight crew in carrying
out its regular duties during flight or on the ground, and thus serve to compromise the safe operation of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., has issued Alert Service Bulletin S.B. A8&hyph;33&hyph;33, dated May 31, 1993, that describes
flight crew and maintenance procedures to detect faulty power supply units. The alert service bulletin also describes
procedures for replacement of any faulty ``Grimes'' unit with a new or serviceable ``Grimes'' unit, or installation
of a new ``Whelan'' system (Modification 8/1273).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
De Havilland, Inc., has also issued Service Bulletin S/B 8&hyph;33&hyph;19, `Revision A', dated May 31, 1993, that
describes procedures for installation of Modification 8/1273, which entails replacing the existing anti-collision
strobe light system (consisting of anti- collision strobe lights, brackets, and power supplies) at all three locations
with the new, improved ``Whelen'' anti-collision strobe light system. (The ``Whelen'' system includes new dual
strobes, new brackets, and new power supplies.) This new system is considered more durable than the currently installed
anti-collision strobe light system. The ``Whelan'' system also has a back-up strobe light at each position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transport Canada Aviation classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive
CF&hyph;93&hyph;20, dated August 3, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require revising the Limitations section of the FAA-approved
Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise flight crew members that certain cockpit indications during in-flight or
ground operations may reveal faulty anti-collision strobe light units, and to provide procedures for subsequent
flight crew action. This proposal would also require replacement of faulty ``Grimes'' units with new or serviceable
``Grimes'' units or installation of the new ``Whelan'' system (Modification 8/1273). The proposed AD would also
require eventual replacement of the existing anti-collision strobe light system with the ``Whelen'' anti-collision
strobe light system (Modification 8/1273) at all three locations. When accomplished, incorporation of this modification
would constitute terminating action for the requirements of this proposal. Following incorporation of Modification
8/1273, operators would be permitted to remove the proposed changes to the AFM. The actions would be required to be
accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, applicability of the proposed rule would exclude those airplanes on which Modification 8/1273 has
been accomplished previously, since airplanes so modified are not subject to the unsafe condition addressed by this
proposed AD. The manufacturer has installed Modification 8/1273 on airplanes having serial numbers 215 and subsequent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 74 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts for installation of Modification 8/1273 at all three locations would cost approximately $1,397 per
airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $168,498,
or $2,277 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspection to detect cracking in
the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the main landing gear (MLG), and replacement
of cracked subassemblies with new or serviceable subassemblies. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracking
in the subassembly of the MLG. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent damage to and/or failure
of the support structure of the MLG.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes
that are equipped with certain Dowty Aerospace main undercarriage units. The RLD advises that cracking has been found
in the fitting subassemblies of the main landing gear (MLG). In three of these instances, the cracking had penetrated
completely through the fitting subassemblies from the side stay attachment lug to the main bore, which resulted in
loss of damping fluid. In another incident, cracking was found in the web section that is adjacent to the inner attachment
bores of the side stay of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. Investigation into the cause of this cracking revealed
that damage to the anodic film resulted in corrosion of these subassemblies. Cracking in the fitting subassemblies
of the MLG, if not corrected, could result in damage to and/or failure of the support structure of the MLG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin F28/32&hyph;149, dated August 30, 1991, that describes procedures for an eddy
current inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the
MLG. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands Airworthiness Directive (BLA)
91&hyph;080, Issue 2, dated February 21, 1992, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes
in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Dowty Aerospace Gloucester, which is the manufacturer of the main undercarriage units installed
on these airplanes, has issued Service Bulletin 32&hyph;161R, Revision 2, dated January 7, 1992, that describes
procedures for replacement of any cracked subassembly with a new subassembly, or a serviceable subassembly that
has been identified previously with service bulletin number ``32&hyph;161R'' on its nameplate. The Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, classified this service bulletin
as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 023&hyph;06&hyph;91 in order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these aviation products in the United Kingdom. The Fokker service bulletin references this Dowty Aerospace Gloucester
service bulletin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require an eddy current inspection to detect cracking
in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the MLG. The actions would be required to be
accomplished in accordance with the Fokker service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would also require replacement of any cracked fittings with new or serviceable fittings in accordance
with the Dowty Aerospace Gloucester service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
14 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,340, or $770
per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this
AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend regulations to clarify use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on a wine label. In response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comments from consumers and wine industry members, ATF is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that a wine which has been designated with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal type designation in accordance with 27 CFR 4.23a, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and which derives not less than 75 percent of its volume from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pinot noir grapes or Napa Gamay grapes, may be further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated with the optional term ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the optional designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' appears on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brand label, it shall be in direct conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and appellation of origin, in lettering of substantially the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same size and kind. ATF believes that this clarification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' will be informative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consumers and industry in the marketing and purchasing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such wines.

Section 105(e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 U.S.C. 205(e), vests broad authority in the Director, ATF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a delegate of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prescribe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations intended to prevent deception of the consumer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to provide the consumer with adequate information as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identity and quality of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations which implement the provisions of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105(e) as they relate to wine are set forth in title 27, Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Federal Regulations, part 4 (27 CFR part 4). Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.23a provides that the name of a single grape variety may be used as the type designation of a grape wine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the wine is labeled with an appellation of origin, and if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not less than 75 percent of the wine is derived from grapes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that variety, the entire 75 percent of which was grown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the labeled appellation of origin area. Section 4.34(b)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that an appellation of origin disclosing the true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin of the wine shall appear in direct conjunction with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in lettering substantially as conspicuous as the class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and type designation if a grape type (varietal) designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used under the provisions of section 4.23a.

History of Gamay Beaujolais Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
For many years ATF has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted the use of ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on wine labels as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal designation. This resulted from the identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 1940's, of a grape grown in Napa County, California as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Gamay grape native to the Beaujolais region of France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the late 1960's, the University of California at Davis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(UCD) determined that the grape known as Napa Gamay was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
true French Gamay and that the Gamay Beaujolais vine was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually a clone of Pinot noir. Since then, ATF has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted wine produced from both the Napa Gamay and Pinot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noir grape varieties to be labeled as ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Foundation Plant Material Service (FPMS) at UCD (a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service operated in cooperation with UCD which makes virus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free, true type plant material available to the industry) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also identified the Gamay Beaujolais vine as a clonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of the Pinot noir variety. More recently, UCD determined that the grape known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as Napa Gamay is not the Gamay grape of France. Napa Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been positively identified by the FPMS as Valdiguie, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although it is not widely known by this name.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1982, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF established the Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee (referred to as the ``Committee'') to conduct an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of the hundreds of grape variety names and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synonyms in use [47 FR 13623, March 31, 1982]. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its charter, the Committee was to advise the Director of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grape varieties and subvarieties which are used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of wine, to recommend appropriate label 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designations for these varieties, and to recommend guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for approval of names suggested for new grape varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Their recommendations were restricted to grape names used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing American wines. The Committee's final report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented to the Director in September 1984, contained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee's findings regarding use of the most appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
names for domestic winegrape varieties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One finding which appeared in the l984 final report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Winegrape Varietal Names Advisory Committee was that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is not the name of any grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety. However, the report did recommend that the term be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted for use during a five year phase out period, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine made either from the grape called Napa Gamay, or from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Gamay Beaujolais clone of Pinot noir.

Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On the basis of the recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the Committee's final report, ATF issued Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No. 581 on February 4, 1986 (51 FR 4392). This notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed the addition of Subpart J, American Grape Variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Names to Part 4. ATF received 156 written comments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In respect to use of Gamay Beaujolais, Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that it should be permitted as an alternate grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety name for future use only for a period of five years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period of its continued use, Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed that the actual name of the grape, either Pinot noir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Napa Gamay, should appear on the label in direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the passage of five years, Gamay Beaujolais could no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used as a label designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments to Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposal to phase out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of Gamay Beaujolais proved controversial. Only three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondents concurred with ATF's proposal to phase out use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay Beaujolais noting that it is not the name of any grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety. Twenty-seven other respondents objected to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. The consensus among these respondents was that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay Beaujolais is well known to consumers as a light red, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
young, fruity wine and that consumers do not view it as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal wine. Several consumers commented that consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition of Gamay Beaujolais is good; that the wine is popular; that consumers know what they are buying; and that

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of the designation would serve no consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose. Winery proprietors cited the large market for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine and argued that elimination of the designation would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a severe economic impact on their business and also on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grape growers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Notice No. 749 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Because the comments on Notice No. 581 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varied widely in their approach to the proposals, and because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lengthy period of time had passed since the issuance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice No. 581, ATF decided to open the issue of grape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal names to additional public comment. Thus, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 3, 1992, ATF issued Notice No. 749 (57 FR 40380), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeking comment on new and revised proposals relating to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grape variety names. In Notice No. 749, ATF proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa Gamay be considered a synonym for the prime name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valdiguie and requested comments on whether Napa Gamay should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be phased out in the future. A resolution of the Napa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay-Valdiguie issue will be in a forthcoming Treasury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision on grape variety names. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The evidence considered by ATF established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is not a true varietal name, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the two grape varieties which have been called ``Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beaujolais'' in this country are not Gamay grapes. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF has concluded that Gamay Beaujolais should not be listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Subpart J of 27 CFR Part 4 as a grape variety name. On the basis of the comments to Notice Nos. 581 and 749 and current
trade and consumer recognition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the name, ATF instead believes that Gamay Beaujolais is generally known as a type of red wine which may be described
as light and fruity. However, ATF believes that many consumers associate the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' with
a wine produced from the Pinot noir or Napa Gamay grape varieties. Therefore, instead of phasing out the use of the designation
``Gamay Beaujolais'' as proposed by Notice No. 581, ATF is proposing to specifically allow the continued use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay Beaujolais under section 4.34. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only wines produced from the Pinot noir or Napa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gamay grape varieties have been labeled as ``Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beaujolais,'' ATF believes that consumers now associate those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two varieties with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, ATF believes that as part of its effort to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardize the use of American varietal names, it should no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer allow the unqualified use of the designation ``Gamay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beaujolais'' to refer to two separate grape varieties, neither 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of which is a true Gamay grape. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, existing regulations provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a wine is not entitled to a varietal type designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless 75 percent of its volume is derived from grapes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that variety. Accordingly, ATF is proposing to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' only where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine derives not less than 75 percent of its volume from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pinot noir grapes or Napa Gamay grapes. Wine which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled with the designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' must also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state on the label a varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay) and an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appellation of origin. Furthermore, the proposed amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 4.34 specifies that the optional designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Gamay Beaujolais'' must appear in direct conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varietal type designation and the appellation of origin, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall appear in lettering of substantially the same size and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that the proposed amendment strikes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance between the views of the opposing commenters on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue. On the one hand, various consumers and winery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietors have commented that consumer recognition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' is good, and that winery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proprietors should not be forced to abandon its use. On the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hand, it has been pointed out that ``Gamay Beaujolais'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not an accurate varietal designation, and the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the varietal grape regulations is to ensure that the consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not misled as to the actual grape varieties used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF believes that allowing the use of the optional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' in direct conjunction with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual varietal type designation (Pinot noir or Napa Gamay), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as an appellation of origin reflecting the true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin of the grapes, will not be confusing or misleading to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers. The proposed amendment will authorize labels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which clearly inform the consumer about the actual grape variety used to make the wine, and the origin of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the grapes, while still allowing winery proprietors to use a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label designation which has gained widespread consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition in this country.

ATF requests comments from all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested persons concerning the proposed wine designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received on or before the closing date will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully considered. Comments received after that date will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given the same consideration if it is practical to do so, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but assurance of consideration cannot be given except as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received on or before the closing date. ATF will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not recognize any material in comments as confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments may be disclosed to the public. Any material which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a respondent considers to be confidential or inappropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for disclosure to the public should not be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments. The name of any person submitting a comment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempt from disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who desires an opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment orally at a public hearing on the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should submit his or her request, in writing, to the Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the 90-day comment period. The Director, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserves the right to determine, in light of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, whether a public hearing will be held.

It is hereby certified that

this proposal will not have a significant economic impact on

a substantial number of small entities. This notice requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on a proposal to authorize the optional use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation ``Gamay Beaujolais'' on a wine label. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of this designation is purely optional, this notice does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not propose any new labeling, reporting, or recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 28, 1993, the Department of Justice published a proposed rule, to be codified at 28 CFR part 505, establishing
procedures for the assessment and collection of a fee to cover the costs of incarceration for federal inmates. (58
FR 34541) In response to public comment and for reasons of administrative management, the Department is publishing
those provisions relating to statutory authority, applicability, and establishment of the fee again for notice
and comment. Further provisions relating to the determination of the average cost of incarceration have been added
to the proposed rule. As an administrative measure, this rule delegates authority to the Director, Bureau of Prisons
(Bureau), to promulgate regulations for collecting the costs of incarceration for inmates committed to the custody
of the Attorney General and to collect such fees. The provisions in the Bureau of Prisons regulations (for example,
procedures for exemption, waiver, or proration of fee assessment, calculation of assessment, and payment and appeal
procedures) will be based upon the previously published proposed rule. Response to public comment on the previously
published proposed rule relating to statutory authority, applicability, establishment of fee, the determination
of the average cost, and administrative procedure is summarized below. Response to public comment relating to other
provisions of the previously published proposed rule will be contained in the commentary for the separate Bureau
of Prisons rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on the proposed rule were received from seven individuals (a federal employee, a law professor, and five
federal inmates). An additional comment was received later from one of the original commenters purporting to contain
the comments of two additional federal inmates. One commenter was in favor of the proposed rule, responding that criminal
defendants should be required not only to pay the costs of their incarceration, but also to bear the burden of the social
and economic costs of their crimes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has carefully reviewed the public comments received concerning the proposed rule and has determined
that a revised rule should be published for comment.

Attorney General's Certification and Rule Indexing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters contested the validity of the rule on procedural grounds. One commenter disagreed with the Attorney
General's certification pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a
substantial number of small entities. This commenter argues that the rule will have a significant financial impact
on various inmates and their families owning joint property or filing joint tax returns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General's certification pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;12, is
appropriate in this case. Under the RFA, neither an inmate or the inmate's family satisfies the definition of a ``small
entity,'' which is defined by the Act as a ``small business,'' ``small organization,'' or ``small governmental jurisdiction''.
5 U.S.C. 601(6). Further discussion of the agency provisions for the amelioration of the potential hardships faced
by certain inmates and their families due to the imposition of a fee for costs of incarceration will be contained in
the commentary for the final rule to be issued by the Bureau of Prisons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second procedural comment received made the proposition that because the proposed rule was indexed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under ``justice'' rather than ``prisons,'' notice of the proposed rule may have been improper. However, this choice
of indexing was due to the fact that the Bureau of Prisons is within the Department of Justice and under the oversight
authority of the Attorney General. Likewise, the rule was originating from the Attorney General and the Department
of Justice. Thus, the rule was properly indexed under ``justice'' rather than ``prisons'' and no notice provisions
of the Administrative Procedure Act were violated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to avoid any further confusion on this issue, however, the Department has decided to issue its regulations
on costs of incarceration as two separate rules. The first rule, proposed for codification at 28 CFR 0.96c, provides
the authority for establishing and collecting a fee for the costs of one year of incarceration. This rule also specifies
the calculation used to determine the average cost of incarceration. In addition, the rule designates the Director
of the Bureau of Prisons as being responsible for the review of the fee, for its calculation in accordance with the formula
set forth in &sect;0.96c(b), and for the publication of each year's fee (or revised fee) as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule also delegates to the Director the authority to promulgate regulations concerning the collection of the
fee, to be codified as a second rule at 28 CFR part 505. As previously proposed, the Director would have been required
both to public the current fee as a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and to amend the fee in the regulation. This requirement has been modified in the interest of reducing unnecessary
regulatory publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Average Cost of Incarceration Figure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to comments concerning the substantive provisions of the proposed rule, three commenters disagreed
with the figure stated in proposed &sect;505.2(b) representing the average cost of incarceration. Two commenters
asserted that the average cost figure is not a fair calculation basis for those inmates placed in or transferred to
minimum-security_and thus lower cost_institutions within the first year. One commenter stated that the figure
was irrational, believing that the assessment would reduce inmates to the poverty level. Finally, one commenter
contended that the Bureau of Prisons should not determine the average cost of incarceration figure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite these contentions, the Attorney General believes that this figure is a reasonable interpretation of the
implementing statute. The plain language of section 111 of Public Law 102&hyph;395 orders the Attorney General to
``establish and collect a fee to cover the costs of confinement,'' with such fee being ``equivalent to the average
cost of one year of incarcertation.'' Public Law 102&hyph;395, section 111(a) (1), (2), 106 Stat. 1828, 1842 (1992).
Although at first glance it may seem fair to assess each fee based upon each individual inmate's cost of incarceration,
this figure would not represent the ``average cost'' to the United States to confine every prisoner. Nor would basing
the fee upon each inmate's initially designated institution be a fair assessment. While an inmate initially could
be designated to a lower cost facility, within the first year he or she might be redesignated to a higher security/administrative,
and higher cost, institution. Thus, the figure merely represents the average cost to the Bureau of Prisons to confine
any prisoner and, accordingly, is a reasonable choice for the Attorney General to make in order to comply with the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to clarify the process and address these concerns, the Department is including in the proposed rule the formula
used to calculate the average cost of one year of incarceration (see &sect;0.96c(b)). This calculation is intended
to provide a figure reflective of the actual costs expended to maintain inmates at Bureau facilities. The fee is calculated
by dividing the expenses incurred at the Central, Regional, and institution level in such areas as salaries, supplies,
travel, and equipment for the care and custody of inmates (e.g., security, programming, maintenance and general
administration), excluding activation costs, by the number of inmate days, and by then multiplying the quotient
by 365. The number of inmate days is calculated by adding, cumulatively, the number of inmates in custody at a given
time each day for the one year period. Activation costs are those expenses incurred by the Bureau in the construction
of new facilities and in their operation before staff assume control of the facility for the arrival of inmates.

Costs of Incarceration Fee vs. Costs of Imprisonment Fine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters pointed out the correlation between this fee assessment and the costs of imprisonment fine imposed
by the sentencing judge pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (USSG) section 5E1.2(i). U.S.S.G. 5E1.2(i).
One commenter believed that the fee assessment in the proposed rule was the responsibility of the sentencing judge,
the other commenter questioned whether proposed rule &sect;505.2(c) vitiates the application of U.S.S.G. &sect;5E1.2(i).
A third commenter noted that the Third Circuit has held that the absence of an authorizing statute in the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 renders &sect;5E1.2(i) invalid. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the two provisions are analogous in their end result, they are not analogous in origin or intent. The amount assessed
under U.S.S.G. &sect;5E1.2(i) is a fine, pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, and is meant to be punitive
in nature as part of an inmate's overall sentence. In contrast, the cost assessed under the proposed rule is a fee, pursuant
to the plain language of a federal statute, and is meant to recoup the administrative costs of confinement and improve
institutional programs. Furthermore, inmates will be assessed only one amount for their costs of confinement. They
will either be assessed a fine under &sect;5E1.2, or a fee under the proposed rule if the sentencing judge did not assess
or waive the fine under &sect;5E1.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters disagreed with the fact that under the proposed rule &sect;505.1, revocation of parole or supervised
release is treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may be imposed. However, this interpretation
is reasonable because in each instance, the offender's conduct results in a distinct incarceration period and an
additional expense to the Attorney General for the cost of the confinement.

 964 F.2d 853 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 113 S. Ct. 635 (1992). However, that case, involving a Missouri statute concerning
the recoupment of costs-of-confinement, was decided narrowly upon Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and federal
law preemption grounds; it did not involve the constitutionality of Missouri's entire cost-of-confinement program,
or such programs in general.

The rule is a matter of internal department management. It will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order
12866.

(a) The Attorney General is authorized to establish and collect a fee to cover the cost of one year of incarceration.
These provisions apply to any person who is convicted in a United States District Court and committed to the custody
of the Attorney General, and who begins service of sentence on or after May 5, 1994. For the purposes of this subpart,
revocation of parole or supervised release shall be treated as a separate period of incarceration for which a fee may
be imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The fee to cover the costs of incarceration shall be calculated by dividing the number representing the obligation
encountered in Bureau of Prisons facilities (excluding activation costs) by the number of inmate-days incurred
for the year, and by then multiplying the quotient by 365. The resulting figure represents the average cost to the Bureau
for confining an inmate for one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Director of the Bureau of Prisons is delegated the authority to collect the fee to cover the cost of incarceration
from inmates committed to the custody of the Attorney General and to promulgate all regulations concerning the collection
of the fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The Director shall review and determine the amount of the fee not less than annually in accordance with the formula
set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The Director shall publish each year's fee as a Notice in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By this notice, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) proposes to adopt standards addressing
indoor air quality in indoor work environments. The basis for this proposed action is a preliminary determination
that employees working in indoor work environments face a significant risk of material impairment to their health
due to poor indoor air quality, and that compliance with the provisions proposed in this notice will substantially
reduce that risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions of the standard are proposed to apply to all indoor ``nonindustrial work environments.'' In addition,
all worksites, both industrial and nonindustrial within OSHA's jurisdiction are covered with respect to the proposed
provisions addressing control of environmental tobacco smoke. The proposal would require affected employers to
develop a written indoor air quality compliance plan and implement that plan through actions such as inspection and
maintenance of building systems which influence indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions under the standard also propose to require employers to implement controls for specific contaminants
and their sources such as outdoor air contaminants, microbial contamination, maintenance and cleaning chemicals,
pesticides, and other hazardous chemicals within indoor work environments. Designated smoking areas which are
to be separate, enclosed rooms exhausted directly to the outside are proposed to be required in buildings where the
smoking of tobacco products is not prohibited. Specific provisions are also proposed to limit the degradation of
indoor air quality during the performance of renovation, remodeling and similar activities. Provisions for information
and training of building system maintenance and operation workers and other employees within the facility are also
included in this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, proposed provisions in this notice address the establishment, retention, availability, and transfer
of records such as inspection and maintenance records, records of written compliance programs, and employee complaints
of building-related illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency invites the submission of written data, views and comments on all regulatory provisions proposed in this
notice, and on all relevant issues pertinent to those provisions. OSHA is also scheduling an informal public hearing
where persons may orally submit their views. It is noted here that subsequent

A. Events Leading to This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Concern about the health hazards posed by occupational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) prompted three
public interest groups to petition the Agency in May 1987 for an Emergency Temporary Standard under section 6(c) of
the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act, 29 U.S.C. 655(c). The American Public Health Association and Public
Citizen submitted a joint petition; Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) also submitted a petition. The petitions requested
the prohibition of smoking in most indoor workplaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA determined, that available data with respect to exposures were insufficient to demonstrate the existence of
a ``grave danger,'' within the meaning of section 6(c) of the OSH Act, from workplace exposure to ETS. OSHA denied the
petitions in September 1989 but continued to investigate regulatory options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In October 1989 ASH filed suit in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of OSHA's
denial of its petition for an Emergency Temporary Standard. The court denied ASH's petition for review in May 1991,
finding that OSHA has reasonably determined that it could not sufficiently quantify the workplace risk associated
with tobacco smoke to justify an Emergency Temporary Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA issued on September 20, 1991, a Request for Information (RFI) (56 FR 47892) on indoor air quality problems, in
order to obtain information necessary to determine whether it would be appropriate and feasible to pursue regulatory
action concerning Indoor Air Quality (IAQ). Issues on which comments were requested in the RFI included health effects
attributable to poor IAQ, ventilation systems performance, exposure assessment, and abatement methods. Information
concerning specific contaminants such as ETS and bioaerosols was also requested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1992, the AFL&hyph;CIO petitioned OSHA to promulgate an overall IAQ standard. OSHA responded in May 1992
that such a standard was under consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the RFI, over 1,200 comments were submitted by interested persons, groups, unions, and industries.
Issues of particular concern identified in the comments, in addition to health effects considerations, include
the lack of ventilation performance standards; the lack of worker training on the operation and maintenance of Heating
Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems; the lack of pollutant source control; and the lack of available
technical guidance on IAQ issues and control techniques.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the comments that specifically addressed the question of whether OSHA should regulate IAQ, a majority (75%) indicate
support for regulation. Of those that commented on the need for regulation, approximately 21% were explicitly in
favor of a regulation on ETS, more than 41% were in favor of an overall IAQ regulation, and approximately 13% were in
favor of a combined IAQ regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous comments focused on the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke and of general indoor air pollution. The
health effects of concern relevant to both tobacco smoke and indoor air pollutants ranged from the acute irritant
effects to cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments submitted in response to the RFI indicated wide support for a regulatory approach that would focus on the
design, operation and maintenance of building ventilation systems, source reduction methodology, and worker information
and training programs. Commenters also recommended that provisions should require that employers receive training
about the regulation and the need for compliance, and that their training regarding building HVAC maintenance and
operation be tailored to the level of complexity of the HVAC system and their personal degree of involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters particularly felt that regulation of IAQ was necessary to eliminate exposures to ETS in the workplace.
Commenters urged the Agency to either ban smoking completely from the workplace or allow smoking only in separately
ventilated, designated smoking areas that were separate from work areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that data submitted to the record, and other evidence, support the conclusion that air contaminants
and other air quality factors can act to present a significant risk of material impairment to employees working in
indoor environments. Adverse health effects associated with poor IAQ may include sensory irritation, respiratory
allergies, asthma, nosocomial infections, humidifier fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Legionnaires' disease,
and the signs and symptoms characteristic of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon monoxide,
formaldehyde, pesticides, endotoxins, or mycotoxins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that available data support proposing regulation of IAQ, including exposure to ETS. Further
stimulus for this determination was provided by conclusions reached in a report published in December, 1992 by the
Environmental Protection Agency, addressing hazards associated with exposure to ETS. In that study, Respiratory
Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer and Other Disorders [Ex. 4&hyph;311], EPA concluded that exposure
to ETS presents an excess risk of induction of cancer in humans. OSHA has submitted this proposed standard to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency which is reviewing it in detail for purposes of submitting detailed comments to
the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons noted above, and discussed in the following sections, OSHA is proposing to address indoor air quality
problems, including exposure to ETS, as set forth in this notice.

Indoor air quality problems can occur in all types and ages of buildings; in newly constructed buildings, in renovated
or remodeled buildings, and in old buildings. Problems in new, clean buildings are rarely, if ever, related to microbial
growth, since the physical structures are new [Ex. 3&hyph;61]. Older buildings that have not been adequately maintained
and operated may have problems with bioaerosols if parts of the building have been allowed to become reservoirs for
microbial growth. Also, if inadequate outside air is provided, regardless of the age of the building, chemical and
biological contaminants will build up to levels that can cause health effects in some workers. In addition, other
physical factors such as lack of windows, noise, and inadequate lighting, and ergonomic factors involving uncomfortable
furniture and intensive use of video display units, etc., will cause discomfort in occupants that may be inaccurately
attributed to air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Some information contained in the docket indicates that these chronic health complaints are psychological, however,
OSHA believes that chronic health complaints related to poor indoor air quality are unlikely to be due to mass psychogenic
illness, even though a psychological overlay is common. It is true that poor management, boring work, poor lighting
conditions, temperature variations, poor ergonomic design, and noise may all lower the threshold for complaint.
Nevertheless, air quality complaints usually have some basis, although they are often difficult to assess with specificity
[Exs. 3&hyph;61C, 4&hyph;144]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Indoor air quality problems are generally classified as Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) or Building-related Illness
(BRI). However, a very important constituent of poor indoor air quality is ETS because of the serious health effects
that result from exposure. The following discussion will first identify the health effects associated with SBS and
BRI. A discussion of the health effects associated with exposure to ETS will follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is important to note that OSHA considers these health effects to be material impairments of health when the worker
is clinically diagnosed with a condition that is either caused or aggravated by poor indoor air quality in the workplace.
For example, in the formaldehyde standard (29 CFR 1910.1048) [Ex. 4&hyph;107] OSHA determined that a physician's
diagnosis of irritation met the requirement of material impairment of health. In addition, OSHA considers all the
other health effects discussed, which are more clinically severe than irritation, to be material impairments of
health as well.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Typically, health effects caused by poor indoor air quality have been categorized as SBS or BRI. In 1983, the World
Health Organization published a list of eight non-inclusive symptoms that characterize Sick Building Syndrome
[Ex. 4&hyph;325]. These include irritation of the eyes, nose and throat; dry mucous membranes and skin; erythema;
mental fatigue and headache; respiratory infections and cough; hoarseness of voice and wheezing; hypersensitivity
reactions; and nausea and dizziness. Generally, these conditions are not easily traced to a specific substance,
but are perceived as resulting from some unidentified contaminant or combination of contaminants. Symptoms are
relieved when the employee leaves the building and may be reduced or eliminated by modifying the ventilation system.
Comments to the docket indicate that such symptoms have been observed in and reported by workers [Exs. 3&hyph;446,
4&hyph;87]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In some instances, outbreaks of SBS are identified with specific pollutant exposures, but in general only general
etiologic factors related to building design, operation and maintenance can be identified [Ex. 4&hyph;274]. In
1987, Woods et al. [Ex. 3&hyph;745] conducted a stratified random telephone survey of 600 U.S. office workers across
the national. Twenty four percent reported that they were dissatisfied with the air quality at the office; while 20%
perceived their performance to be hampered by poor indoor air quality. Women were nearly twice as likely to report
a productivity effect of poor indoor air quality than men (28% versus 15%). Based on this, Woods et al. [Ex. 3&hyph;745]
hypothesized that 20% of U.S. office workers are exposed to indoor conditions which manifest as SBS. In fact, complaints
about SBS have become so numerous that 37 out of 53 states and territories have designated a building complaints investigation
contact person [Ex. 4&hyph;310].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Breysse [Ex. 4&hyph;32] reported on symptoms associated with new carpeting in a state office building, in order of
prevalence: headache, eye and throat irritation, nausea, dizziness, eye tearing, chest tightness, diarrhea, cough,
muscle aches, burning nose, fatigue, dark urine, and rashes. Twenty out of 35 persons were affected. Air sampling
was conducted before and after carpet removal; a similar range of aliphatic hydrocarbons was found after removal,
but in much lower concentrations. Many individuals who believe the building they work in is implicated in SBS, have
described similar effects. Symptoms usually include one or more of the following: mucous membrane (eye, nose, or
throat) irritation, dry skin, headache, nausea, fatigue, and lethargy [Ex. 4&hyph;293]. These symptoms are generally
believed to result from indoor air pollution. There is no secondary spread of symptoms to others outside the building
who are exposed to the occupants (unlike the situation faced by many chemical and asbestos workers). Anderson [Ex.
4&hyph;10] suggested the possible causes for SBS as related to psychosocial, chemical, physical, or biological
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Anderson [Ex. 4&hyph;10] distinguished SBS symptoms as different from mass psychogenic illness; although in general
the causes of SBS are unknown, he suggested that most SBS symptoms could be explained by stimulation of sensory nerve
fibers in the upper airways and the face (referred to as common chemical sense). Because these fibers can respond in
only one way, SBS cases largely have the same symptoms irrespective of the cause [Ex. 4&hyph;10]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It is now known that there is a variety of important health effects from indoor air pollution. In addition to the indoor
environmental disease caused by infectious agents, carcinogens or toxins; the indoor environment may create conditions
that can produce skin and mucosal allergy and hyperactivity reactions, sensory effects (odors and irritations),
airways effects (from both acute and chronic exposures), neuropsychological effects, and psychosocial effects,
especially due to the lack of social support [Ex. 4&hyph;200]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Indoor air pollution may be caused by physical, chemical, or microbiological agents, and is aggravated by poor ventilation.
The causation of SBS by indoor air pollution was first objectively demonstrated in 1984 in a study of 62 Danish subjects
suffering from ``indoor climate symptoms'' [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. These subjects reported primarily eye and upper respiratory
irritation, but were otherwise healthy individuals, and did not suffer from asthma, allergy, or bronchitis. The
subjects were exposed to a mixture of 22 volatile organic chemicals commonly found in the indoor environment at concentrations
of 0, 5, and 25 mg/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These concentrations corresponded respectively to ``clean'' air, average polluted air in Danish houses, and maximum
polluted air in Danish houses. After exposure, the Digit Span test was administered. The Digit Span test consists
of the subject being allowed to view a series of random digits for a short period of time; the numbers are then covered
up and the subject asked to repeat the sequence backwards. This test is reported to be sensitive to situational anxiety
and alertness, and therefore a measure of stress and ability to concentrate. Bach et al. found significant declines
in performance on the digit span test following exposure to these low levels of volatile organic chemicals, demonstrating
objectively the existence of SBS [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Molhave et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;228], in reporting on the same 62 subjects, found that subjects exposed for 23/4 hrs did
not adapt, and that the subjects reacted to irritation of the mucous membranes and not to odor intensity. The exposure
was doubled-blind, and neither the subjects nor the testers knew the exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although these problems have been demonstrated to be real, they may affect only a small percentage of building occupants.
Also, there are various degrees of problems which may occur. Some individuals who experience relatively mild and
treatable symptoms such as headache, may be able to cope with the sick building environment for extended periods,
although suffering from increased stress. Other individuals, more seriously affected, may find symptoms so severe
that they may be unable to be in the building for extended periods, or at all. Still others may become temporarily or
permanently disabled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It has been suggested that SBS may not be one syndrome but a number of sub-syndromes [Ex. 4&hyph;170]. This hypothesis
suggests that the symptoms particularly associated with chemical exposure include fatigue; headache; dry and irritated
eyes, nose, and throat; and sometimes include nausea and dizziness. Those symptoms most related to microbial exposures
would result in itchy, congested, or runny nose; itchy watery eyes; and sometimes include wheezing, tight chest,
or flu-like symptoms. The overlapping symptoms in each case are eye, nose, and throat irritation, perhaps making
the two sub-syndromes, chemical and microbial, difficult to distinguish. Jones concludes that there is a need for
a treatment protocol as well as a diagnostic protocol, which, in addition to describing corrective actions available
in response to different diagnostic findings, would also provide guidelines for the design and implementation of
follow-up studies of buildings and individuals in order to assess treatment effectiveness [Ex. 3&hyph;170]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Randolph and Moss [Ex. 4&hyph;258] have written about a number of problems ascribed to indoor air pollution in the
chemically sensitive patient. These problems include irritability from natural gas fumes, allergy to dust from
forced air ventilation systems, intoxication and even hallucination from paint fumes. Randolph describes chemical
sensitivity to dry cleaning chemicals, and rug shampoo, and implicates moldy carpets in producing allergenic substances.
He also describes joint pain, malaise, and fatigue due to pesticide exposure; and skin rashes from exposure to plasticizers.
Randolph further describes intolerance to highly scented products such as deodorant soaps, toilet deodorants,
and disinfectants, especially pine-scented ones. Other patients have reported reacting to strong perfumes and
other cosmetics. So-called air fresheners often prove to be particularly troublesome. He also describes that some
patients are sensitive to the odors from hot plastic-coated wires in electronic equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 There is little data on the perceptions of victims of SBS. Shapiro [Ex. 4&hyph;282] has complied a summary of 16 case-histories
of SBS in the victims' own words. It is useful to review these for insight into the problems from the victims' point of
view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 One episode that Shapiro [Ex. 4&hyph;282] reported on was in a building occupied by a government agency. As a result
of problems related to carpeting and other suspected causes, five workers were reported to have left the agency, 11
were relocated to alternative workspace or worked at home, and 100 reported to the agency's medical officer that they
had SBS related problems. The range of self-reported symptoms included a variety of moderate and acute respiratory
problems; headache; sore throat; burning of the eyes, lungs, and skin; rashes; fatigue; laryngitis; clumsiness;
disorientation; loss of balance; nausea; numbness in extremities and face; and difficulty with mental tasks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The patient's reported that the diagnoses of the occupational health physicians they visited included upper and
lower respiratory irritation, intoxication-type syndrome, occupational asthma, and chronic hypersensitivity
pneumonitis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central nervous system effects reported by many do not lend themselves to ready diagnosis [Ex. 4&hyph;282]. Some
of the lesser affected individuals either saw no physician at all or saw a family doctor or allergist who was not familiar
with occupational or environmental health [Ex. 4&hyph;282]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Force Procedural Guide [Ex. 4&hyph;199] on dealing with SBS takes a practical view: ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;in
most cases the sick building syndrome does not have a clearly understood etiology and many of the SBS studies and investigations
were inconclusive. The significance of exposure that [what chemical or physical agent concentrations cause symptoms]
can be pathogenic remains unanswered, but the realities of worker complaints and discomfort are valid reasons to
seriously address this problem.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, SBS is not a well-defined disease with well-defined causes. It appears to be a reaction, at least in part
due to stimulation of the common chemical sense, to a variety of chemical, physical or biological stimuli. Its victims
display all or some of a pattern of irritation of the mucous membranes, and the worst affected individuals have neurological
symptoms as well.

B. Building-Related Illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Building-related illness (BRI) describes specific medical conditions of known etiology which can often be documented
by physical signs and laboratory findings. Such illnesses include sensory irritation when caused by known agents,
respiratory allergies, nosocomial infections, humidifier fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Legionnaires'
disease, and the symptoms and signs characteristic of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon
monoxide, formaldehyde, pesticides, endotoxins, or mycotoxins [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;144]. Some of these conditions
are caused by exposure to bioaerosols containing whole or parts of viruses, fungi, bacteria, or protozoans. These
illnesses are often potentially severe and, in contrast to SBS complaints, are often traceable to a specific contaminant
source, such as mold infestation and/or microbial growth in cooling towers, air handling systems, and water-damaged
furnishings. Symptoms may or may not disappear when the employee leaves the building. Susceptibility is influenced
by host factors, such as age and immune system status. Mitigation of building-related illnesses requires identification
and removal of the source, especially in cases involving hypersensitivity responses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments submitted to the docket in response to the RFI and contained in the literature indicate that specific substances
or classes of substances have been implicated as contributing to poor indoor air quality problems. These substances,
either alone or in synergy, have produced health effects that OSHA believes can be considered material impairment
[Ex. 4&hyph;124]. In most cases, people likely to be at risk have specific susceptibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
But such susceptibility is common and adverse effects can arise suddenly following exposure. The relevant effects
can be categorized into six categories: irritation, pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous system, reproductive,
and cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Common chemical sense or irritation perception is mediated through receptors found not only throughout the nasal,
pharyngeal, and laryngeal areas of the respiratory system but also on the surface of the eyes, specifically the conjunctiva
and cornea [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. It is partially through the stimulation of these receptors that exposed persons perceive
irritation. Many comments to the docket, from citizens, researchers, and indoor air consultants, raised the issue
about the irritating effects related to known indoor air contaminants. The air contaminants of concern include formaldehyde
[Exs. 3&hyph;14, 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440a, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;575, 4&hyph;125, 4&hyph;144,
4&hyph;214], volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500, 4&hyph;145, 4&hyph;243,
4&hyph;320], ozone [Exs. 3&hyph;14, 4&hyph;42, 4&hyph;134, 4&hyph;236, 4&hyph;237], carpet-associated chemicals
[Exs. 3&hyph;25, 3&hyph;444D, 3&hyph;576, 4&hyph;144, 4&hyph;214], vehicle exhausts [Exs. 3&hyph;6, 3&hyph;63,
3&hyph;206, 3&hyph;238, 3&hyph;360, 3&hyph;437, 3&hyph;444D, 3&hyph;631, 3&hyph;659], combustion gases [Ex.
3&hyph;32], particulates [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], man-made mineral fibers (fiberglass, glasswool
and rockwool) [Ex. 4&hyph;33], and pesticides [Ex. 3&hyph;446]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The irritation effects present as sensory irritation of the skin and upper airways, irritation of eye, nose and throat,
dry mucous membranes, erythema, headache, and abnormal taste [Ex. 3&hyph;14, 4&hyph;33]. The pulmonary effects
include upper and lower respiratory tract effects such as rapid breathing, fatigue, increased infection rate, broncho-constriction,
pulmonary edema, asthma, allergies and flu-like symptoms. Acute exposure to low level of air contaminants results
in primarily reversible effects, while chronic exposure may result in pulmonary fibrosis that can result in irreversible
damage [Exs. 3&hyph;14, 4&hyph;33]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These health effects were associated, as reported in many comments to the docket, with specific contaminants, including
asbestos [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500], combustion gases [Exs. 3&hyph;14, 3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;440A,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], formaldehyde [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A, 4&hyph;124], ozone
[Exs. 4&hyph;42, 4&hyph;237], VOCs [Ex. 3&hyph;32], vehicular exhaust [Ex. 3&hyph;63], and particulates [Exs.
3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals with underlying pulmonary disease, such as asthma, are more susceptible than others to acute exposure
to these indoor air contaminants and experience coughing and wheezing at low levels of exposure. Synergism may occur
between chemical contaminants, such as ozone and VOCs, in aggravating asthma [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. These affected individuals
may also be at increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the synergistic effect between chemical and microbial
contaminants [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cardiovascular effects have also been associated with poor indoor air quality. These effects are presented as headache,
fatigue, dizziness, aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease, and damage to the heart. These effects are
associated with exposure to combustion gases such as carbon monoxide [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;440A], VOCs [Ex. 3&hyph;500],
and particulates [Ex. 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nervous system effects have also been produced due to exposure to poor indoor air quality. These effects include headache,
blurred vision, fatigue, malaise with nausea, ringing in the ears, impaired judgement, and polyneuritis. These
effects are associated with exposure to carbon dioxide [Ex. 3&hyph;14], carbon monoxide [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], formaldehyde [Exs. 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500], and VOCs [Exs. 3&hyph;32,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relevant reproductive effects include menstrual irregularities and birth defects and are associated with exposure
to formaldehyde [Exs. 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500] and VOCs [Exs. 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The occurrence of cancer has also been attributed to exposures associated with poor indoor air quality. In particular,
cancer of the lung, including mesothelioma, esophagus, stomach, and colon have been associated with exposure to
asbestos [Exs. 3&hyph;6, 3&hyph;14, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500], radon [Exs. 3&hyph;35,
3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A, 3&hyph;500], vehicular exhausts [Exs. 3&hyph;84, 3&hyph;206, 3&hyph;360H],
combustion gases [Ex. 3&hyph;500], VOCs [Exs. 3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500, 4&hyph;294], and particulates [Ex. 3&hyph;500].

2. Microbial Contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Building-related illnesses can result in serious illness and death. Indoor transmission of disease caused by obligate
pathogens (microbes that require a living host) is common in indoor environments, especially those that are overcrowded
and inadequately ventilated [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Diseases in this category include influenza, rhinovirus or colds,
and measles. Indoor transmission of disease caused by opportunistic microorganisms usually affects compromised
individuals, those with existing conditions that make them more susceptible to infection, such as pulmonary disease
or immunodeficiency. Legionnaires' disease, pulmonary tract infections, and humidifier fever are diseases that
fall into this category. Diseases that affect the immune system include allergic reactions, as seen in antibody-mediated
responses (asthma and rhinitis) and interstitial lung disease, as seen in cell-mediated reactions (hypersensitivity
pneumonitis) [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. All of these diseases produce substantial amounts of illness each year [Exs. 4&hyph;33,
4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;214].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the U.S., Legionnaires' disease is considered to be a fairly common, serious form of pneumonia. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 bacterium is one of the top three bacterial agents in the U.S. which causes sporadic community-acquired pneumonia.
Because of the difficulty in clinically distinguishing this disease from other forms of pneumonia, many cases go
unreported. Although approximately 1,000 cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention annually,
it has been estimated that over 25,000 cases of the illness actually occur. This disease burden is estimated to result
in over 5,000 to 7,000 deaths per year [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. Brooks et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;33] reported that as many as 116,000
cases occur each year. Of these cases, it is estimated that between 35,000 and 40,000 die. The attack rate for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. pneumophila 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ranges from 0.1 to 5%. The case fatality rate ranges from 15 to 20% [Ex. 4&hyph;214]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two serious allergic or hypersensitivity diseases are asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic
alveolitis). An estimated 3% of the U.S. population suffers from asthma (approximately 9,000,000 people) [Ex. 4&hyph;41].
These individuals may be more susceptible to bioaerosol contamination or chemical contamination of the indoor environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is triggered by recurrent exposure to microbials, fumes, vapors, and dusts [Ex. 4&hyph;33].
The lung interstitium, terminal bronchioles, and alveoli react in an inflammatory process that can organize into
granulomas and progress to fibrosis. The symptoms of acute episodes of this disease are malaise, fever, chills, cough
and dyspnea. The symptoms of chronic episodes are serious respiratory symptoms such as progressive dyspnea. Chronic
disease can lead to irreversible pulmonary structural and functional changes [Ex. 4&hyph;33].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 15% (20,250) of 135,000 hospital admissions per year that last an average of more than eight days are
due to allergic disease [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. Burge and Hodgson estimate that these hospitalizations cost five million
work days per year. The prevalence of symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, an interstitial lung
disease caused by organic dusts or by aerosols has been examined in subpopulations at well-defined, increased risk,
such as farmers (0.1&hyph;32%) or pigeon breeders (0.1&hyph;21%) [Exs. 4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;214]. The only unbiased
source of complaint rates in unselected office workers are control buildings used in the study of hypersensitivity
pneumonitis in the U.S. Arnow et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;15] reported complaints consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis
in 1.2 percent and Gamble et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;116] in 4 percent of these populations. Since no clinical data are available,
it is not known how these complaints are related to actual disease, and it is unknown whether these complaints are associated
with lost work time, doctor visits or hospital admissions [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Humidifier fever, a less serious variant of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also is caused by exposure to microorganisms
contained in an aerosol. Attack rates in building epidemics have been as high as 75%, whereas complaint rates are usually
2&hyph;3% in nonepidemic situations [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. Because of the similarity of the individual symptoms to other
diseases (fever, headache, polyuria, weight loss and joint pain), it is often difficult to separate actual disease
from complaints related to the common cold in nonepidemic situations [Exs. 4&hyph;33, 4&hyph;41]. While rare, a
workplace epidemic of humidifier fever can virtually shut down an entire building, and only removal of the contamination
will end the epidemic [Exs. 4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;144, 4&hyph;214]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Microbial contamination of building structures, furnishings, and HVAC system components contribute to poor indoor
air quality problems, especially those related to building-related illnesses. OSHA believes that consequent health
effects constitute material impairment of health [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;41]. These can be categorized as irritation,
pulmonary, cardiovascular, nervous system, reproductive, and cancer effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irritation effects, either from the physical presence of bioaerosols or from exposure to VOCs released by biologicals,
have been demonstrated in susceptible workers [Ex. 3&hyph;32]. In addition, water leakage on furnishings or within
building components can result in the proliferation of microorganisms that can release acutely irritating substances
into the air. Typically, where microorganisms are allowed to grow, a moldy smell develops. This moldy smell is often
associated with microbial contamination and is a result of VOCs released during microbial growth on environmental
substrates [Ex. 4&hyph;41]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pulmonary effects which have been associated with exposure to bioaerosols include rhinitis, asthma, allergies,
hypersensitivity diseases, humidifier fever, spread of infections including colds, viruses, and tuberculosis,
and the occurrence of Legionnaire's disease [Exs. 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;32, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;61B, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;440A,
3&hyph;446, 3&hyph;500, 4&hyph;41, 4&hyph;144, 4&hyph;214]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building-related asthma has also recently been documented in office workers [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;43] and some
case reports show it to be associated specifically with humidifier use. Biocides used in humidification systems
are suspected causes of office-associated asthma [Ex. 4&hyph;103].

Cardiovascular effects manifested as chest pain, and nervous system effects manifested as headache, blurred vision,
and impaired judgment, have occurred in susceptible people following exposure to bioaerosols [Exs. 3&hyph;32,
3&hyph;446]. It has been suggested that these effects may be caused by VOCs released by the microbiologicals, or they
may be a complication of related pulmonary effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of cancer in susceptible people is possible following exposure to certain types of toxigenic fungi
and mycotoxins. However, the probability of such exposures occurring in workplaces covered by this standard is probably
limited. Mycotoxins (toxins produced as secondary metabolites by many fungi) are among the most carcinogenic of
known substances, and are also acutely toxic. The American Conference of Governmental and Industrial Hygienists
wrote ``[t]he toxigenic fungi are common contaminants of stored grain and other food products and have caused well-described
outbreaks of acute systemic toxicosis as well as specific organ carcinogenesis when such food is consumed *&blank;*&blank;*
It appears clear that massive contamination with a highly toxigenic fungus strain of a site in which aerial dispersion
of metabolic products occurred would be necessary to induce acute symptoms. However, considering the carcinogenicity
of many fungal toxins, an examination of the risks of chronic inhalation exposure appears justified'' [Ex. 3&hyph;61].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, most of the health effects associated with SBS and BRI occur in indoor environments were concentrations
of pollutants are much less than the OSHA Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs) (29 CFR 1910.1000) [Ex. 4&hyph;3]. It
is important to point out that the PELs are chemical-specific standards that are not only based on health effects but
also on technological feasibility, cost restraints and a ``healthy'' worker exposed for a 40-hour work week. In the
industrial workplace, hazards are minimized by the use of administrative and engineering controls and the use of
personal protective equipment. The nonindustrial environment, however, does not have these controls. Ventilation
systems are designed only to remove occupant-generated contaminants, such as carbon dioxide and odors. These types
of systems were not designed to dilute multiple point sources of contaminants that are typically found in nonindustrial
workplaces (see section III). Unless adequate ventilation and source controls are utilized and adequately maintained,
many of the chemical contaminants can concentrate to levels that induce symptoms. The possibility exists that synergistic
effects occur. These effects occur not only between substances to enhance their toxicity but also by lowering the
resistance to lung infection in susceptible persons.

ETS is composed of exhaled mainstream and sidestream smoke. The chemical composition and exposure sources of ETS

A wide spectrum of health effects have been associated with exposure to ETS. These effects include mucous membrane
irritation, decrease in respiratory system performance, adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, reproductive
effects, and cancer. The following section also presents more detailed information on these health effects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether a chemical elicits toxicity or not depends not only on its inherent potency and site specificity but also on
how the human system can metabolize and excrete that particular chemical. To produce health effects, the constituents
of ETS must be absorbed and must be present in appropriate concentration at the sites of action. After absorption,
some of these contaminants are metabolized to less toxic metabolites while some carcinogens are activated by metabolism
in the body. Available biomarkers of ETS, such as nicotine, clearly show that nonsmoker exposure is of sufficient
magnitude to be absorbed and to result in measurable levels of these biomarkers. There is sufficient evidence in the
literature to indicate that several components of sidestream smoke are rapidly absorbed and widely distributed
within the body. However, the extent of absorption, distribution, retention and metabolism of these contaminants
in the body depends upon various physiological and pharmacokinetic parameters that are influenced by gender, race,
age and smoking habits of the exposed individuals. These parameters and others may result in differences in susceptibility
among exposed subpopulations. Nicotine is one of the most widely studied constituents of tobacco smoke. There have
been numerous studies on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine in both animals and man.

(a) Absorption and distribution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Absorption and distribution of tobacco smoke constituents are usually measured by using surrogate markers. A correlation
between nicotine absorption and exposure to tobacco smoke has between demonstrated, thus making nicotine an appropriate
marker for tobacco smoke in pharmacokinetic studies. The steady state volume of distribution for nicotine is large
indicating that it is widely distributed within the body [Ex. 4&hyph;185]. Nicotine has been shown to bind with plasma
proteins which may interfere with elimination and thereby prolong retention in the body. The studies in the docket
clearly indicate that nicotine and other constituents of tobacco smoke are readily absorbed and distributed throughout
the body thereby increasing the potential of producing adverse effects at more then one target site.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

, has resulted in the identification of more than 20 metabolic products in the plasma and urine of humans and animals.
The principle metabolic pathways of nicotine appear to involve oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to yield nicotine-1
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-N-oxide and cotinine, the latter being the major metabolite and the precursor of many of the metabolic products
of nicotine. Some of the metabolites detected in the urine of rats after intravenous administration in a study by Kyerematen
et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;185] are listed in Table II&hyph;1. In humans, cotinine is the major degradation product of nicotine
metabolism and has a serum half-life of about 17 hours compared to two hours for the parent compound, nicotine [Exs.
4&hyph;27, 4&hyph;253]. Trans-3
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-hydroxycotinine in the free form constitutes the largest single metabolite in smokers' urine accounting
for 35&hyph;40% of the urinary nicotine metabolite [Exs. 4&hyph;48, 4&hyph;241]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smokers and nonsmokers differ in their metabolism of nicotine and cotinine [Exs. 4&hyph;133, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;279].
The half-life values for urinary elimination of nicotine and cotinine were found to be significantly shorter in smokers
than nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;186]. Plasma nicotine clearance was faster in smokers than in nonsmokers in this study.
More rapid elimination of nicotine and cotinine has been attributed to the inductive effects of chronic cigarette
smoking on the hepatic metabolism of many xenobiotic agents. However, Benowitz et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;29] were unable
to confirm published research suggesting that smokers metabolize nicotine and cotinine more rapidly than nonsmokers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Variations in nicotine metabolism occur among individuals. Variations also occur due to differences in gender and
race [Exs. 4&hyph;26, 4&hyph;186, 4&hyph;314]. It has also been suggested that the metabolism of nicotine between
smokers and nonsmokers may differ. Male smokers have been shown to metabolize nicotine faster than do female smokers
after intravenous infusion of nicotine and active smoking. However, this difference was not observed by Benowitz
and Jacob [Ex. 4&hyph;23] during a study of daily intake of nicotine in smokers versus nonsmokers. The metabolism
of nicotine has also been studied in animals. Male rats (4 strains) were shown to metabolize nicotine faster than did
females [Ex. 4&hyph;185]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the potential effect of nicotine, and other ETS constituents in the body, is governed by interactions
between several physiological and pharmacokinetics parameters. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interactions may lead to longer retention of toxic constituents, thus prolonging the effects on the target organs
resulting in tissue injury.

Exposure to ETS is capable of inducing eye and upper respiratory tract irritation. Common chemical sense or irritation
perception is mediated through receptors in the fifth, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves. These receptors are found
throughout the nasal, pharyngeal, and laryngeal areas of the respiratory system and also on the surface of the eyes
[Ex. 4&hyph;239]. It is partially through the stimulation of these receptors that exposed persons perceive irritation.

The ability of tobacco smoke to elicit irritation may be enhanced by low relative humidity and varies according to
concentration [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. Irritating components of ETS are contained in both the vapor phase and the particulate
phase (see Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7). These effects have been studied in both experimental (e.g., animals
studies; clinical and chamber studies on humans) and field (e.g., surveys and epidemiological studies) studies.
The NRC report [Ex. 4&hyph;239] summarized these studies and concluded that even though the specific components
of ETS that cause irritation were not identified, the overall effects were eye and throat irritation and immunological
responses. Weber [Ex. 4&hyph;317] reported the results of a field study that included 44 workrooms where smoking
was taking place. Eye irritation was reported by 52 out of 167 workers. Nonsmokers reacted more than smokers to the
ETS; 36 of the 52 workers who reported eye irritation at work were nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;317]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Asano et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;18] reported significant eye irritation, as measured by blinking rates, in both healthy
smoking and nonsmoking adults following exposure to ETS. Nonsmokers reported more eye irritation than smokers did.
Effects such as eye irritation and nasal stuffiness were reported to OSHA in comments to the docket [Exs. 3&hyph;38,
3&hyph;58, 3&hyph;59, 3&hyph;188, 3&hyph;438D, 3&hyph;440A].

3. Pulmonary Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Much of the literature relevant to the association between non-cancerous health effects and ETS has focused on children.
Because children are undergoing development and maturation, they are not physiologically equivalent to adults
exposed to the same conditions. Therefore, findings in studies conducted with respect to ETS and children may not
be directly applicable to adults. However, a number of studies have investigated the relationship between ETS and
pulmonary health effects in adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies which are restricted to adults vary by numerous factors, such as the population studied, the measures used
to estimate exposure to ETS, and the physiologic and health outcomes examined. The studies also varied in the consideration
of potential confounders. A number of studies have found relationships between ETS exposure and pulmonary health
effects. These studies have: (1) used pulmonary function tests, which may be more sensitive than methods used in other
studies, to detect physiological changes occurring in the small airways of the lungs (e.g., forced mid-expiratory
flow rate (FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
25&hyph;75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and forced end-expiratory flow rate (FEF
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
75&hyph;85
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)); (2) studied older populations with a longer history of exposure to ETS; (3) stratified the level of ETS exposure
with significant findings more likely to occur in persons with higher exposures; and (4) more frequently found significant
changes in lung function in men, although adverse pulmonary effects to ETS have also been shown in women. The following
discussion summarizes the results of these studies [Exs. 4&hyph;18, 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;62, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;173,
4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;180, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;278, 4&hyph;295, 4&hyph;321].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Asano et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;18] demonstrated the acute physiologic changes which occur as a result of exposure to ETS.
Nonsmokers had more pronounced changes in eye blinking rates (a measure of eye irritation), expired carbon monoxide,
increased heart rate and systolic blood pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies of ETS and chronic health effects in adults differ by how they define ``never smokers'', ``exsmokers'', and
how other various levels of ETS exposure are defined, either in nominal, ordinal or interval scales; and whether or
not they take into account exposure both in the workplace and at home. The potential for misclassification bias occurs
when ``nonsmokers'' are loosely defined and used as the comparative group to passive smokers. Several studies considered
the confounding impact of environmental air pollution [Ex. 4&hyph;278], indoor cooking fuels [Exs. 4&hyph;37,
4&hyph;62] or occupational exposures to dusts and fumes [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210,
4&hyph;321]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been fewer longitudinal studies [Exs. 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;278, 4&hyph;295] as compared to the majority
which have been cross-sectional studies. The duration of exposure, which is critical to producing a measurable health
effect, was quantified by number of years directly in several studies [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;173,
4&hyph;295, 4&hyph;321], or indirectly by the age of the population under study [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210].
In those studies which had carefully assessed for level of exposure and had specified a duration of at least 10 years,
significant pulmonary function decrements were noted in both men and women [Exs. 4&hyph;37, 4&hyph;148, 4 176, 4&hyph;321].
Overall, changes in pulmonary indices are more likely to occur in men than in women, however, several studies have
documented statistically significant physiological changes in pulmonary function occurring in women [Exs. 4&hyph;37,
4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;178, 4&hyph;321]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Understanding the significance of findings is complicated because studies used a variety of measures from spirometry.
Although most studies evaluated FVC (forced vital capacity) and FEV

 (forced expiratory volume in one second), fewer studies have measured FEF

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

or FEF

 [Exs. 4&hyph;176, 4&hyph;180, 4&hyph;209, 4&hyph;210, 4&hyph;321]. These later measures have been suggested
as being more sensitive to detecting changes in the small airways where effects of ETS are most likely to occur [Exs.
4&hyph;46, 4&hyph;216, 4&hyph;230, 4&hyph;231]. However, there is no clear consensus in the medical literature
as to the routine clinical use of FEF

 due to ETS exposure in passive smokers as compared to never smokers, ranges from 80 milliliters (ml) [Ex. 4&hyph;148]
to 190 ml [Ex. 4&hyph;37]. When this decrement is expressed as a percent of FEV

, it has been estimated to be 5.7% in males, or 7.3% when these same subjects were matched for age [Ex. 4&hyph;210]. As
a means of comparison, the average loss in lung volume per year due to aging alone is estimated to be 25 to 30 ml [Ex. 4&hyph;329].
The American Thoracic Society [Ex. 4&hyph;8] specifies that spirometry equipment have a level of accuracy within
50 ml. Since pulmonary function maneuvers are very effort dependent, intra-individual variation between the three
best efforts should be within 5% to be acceptable. The importance of these spirometry criteria is emphasized by the
fact that the FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may result in being 100 to 200 ml lower than when a maximal effort is given by the subject. Furthermore, a decrease of
15% must be achieved before certain pulmonary indices are considered outside of normal limits. Given this perspective,
although changes in pulmonary function tests may truly occur as a result of exposure to ETS over a number of years, the
actual clinical impact may not be apparent in the healthy, young individual. Older individuals and those with preexisting
pulmonary disease are more susceptible to the pulmonary effects of exposure to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outside of respiratory changes being documented through pulmonary function testing, other symptoms have been found
to be significantly associated with ETS exposure. Hole et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;148] found a significant increase in the
prevalence of infected sputum, persistent sputum, dyspnea and hypersecretion in passive smokers as compared to
controls. Furthermore, rates increased as those exposed were stratified by level of exposure to passive smoke from
low to high. Kauffmann et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;178] noted a significant increased risk for dyspnea in American (Odds Ratio
(OR)=1.42) and French women (OR=1.43), and an increased risk for wheeze in American women (OR=1.36). Schwartz and
Zeger [Ex. 4&hyph;278] found an increased risk for phlegm or sputum in a 3-year longitudinal study (OR=1.41). This
risk was raised to 1.76 when asthmatics, who may be medicated, were excluded from the analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As small airway disease progresses to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (also referred to as chronic
obstructive lung disease (COLD)), the impact of ETS becomes more detectable. Kalandidi et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;173] reported
an adjusted odds ratio of 2.5 (90% Confidence Interval (CI), 1.3 to 5.0) for Greek women never smokers exposed to their
husbands' tobacco smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While there is a clear trend, and in several studies a statistically significant finding of a demonstrated decrease
in pulmonary function indices, or an increase in respiratory symptoms in passive smokers, the impairment nonsmokers
suffer by the exposure may not be immediately obvious. It is important to note that these findings have been demonstrated
in otherwise healthy individuals. Based upon the finding of White and Froeb [Ex. 4&hyph;321], Fielding and Phenow
[Ex. 4&hyph;102] have described such changes as being equivalent to those found in light smokers, who smoke from 1
to 10 cigarettes per day. Where a decrease of 100 to 200 ml of FVC or FEV
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may be clinically insignificant in healthy persons, such a change may be significant for workers with already impaired
pulmonary function [Exs. 3&hyph;438D, 3&hyph;440A, 4&hyph;76, 4&hyph;182]. These changes may be the pivotal point
at which a worker becomes unable to continue to work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cellular effects on the pulmonary tissue have also been observed in animals exposed to ETS during experimental studies.
Several studies reviewed by OSHA have demonstrated that chronic cigarette smoke exposure produces an accumulation
of alveolar macrophages (AM) (the presence of AM indicates a body's response to environmental insults), within the
respiratory bronchioles of many animals species. This effect is similar to that seen in human smokers [Exs. 4&hyph;31,
4&hyph;58, 4&hyph;109, 4&hyph;110, 4&hyph;140, 4&hyph;147, 4&hyph;150, 4&hyph;179, 4&hyph;212, 4&hyph;249].
Increased elastase secretion by alveolar macrophages from mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke has also
been observed [Ex. 4&hyph;322]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs) is also an indication of the body's response to environmental
insults. PMNs were found in the alveolar septum of cigarette smoke-exposed hamsters, similar to the PMNs observed
in the lungs of human smokers [Ex. 4&hyph;204]. In contrast to the focal nature of the alveolar macrophages accumulation,
the accumulation of PMN is diffuse. Studies of PMN leukocyte function have not been systematically evaluated in smoke-exposed
animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other studies also show effects of ETS exposure at the cellular level. For example, young lambs exposed to ETS for one
month did not develop detectable pulmonary system effects or alteration in lung mechanics or airway responsiveness.
However, the lambs did develop inflammation of pulmonary cells [Ex. 4&hyph;290]. A cytotoxic effect of tobacco smoke
was also demonstrated by decreased intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content in guinea pig alveolar macrophages
and lowered cell bacteriocidal activity in a study by Firlik [Ex. 4&hyph;104]).

Exposure to tobacco smoke has been shown to increase the permeability of the respiratory epithelial membrane to macromolecules.
Burns et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;45] have shown that exposure of guinea pigs to tobacco smoke followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran
(FITC&hyph;D, molecular weight 10,000) increased the amount of intact FITC&hyph;D that crossed the respiratory
epithelium into the vascular space. Transmission electron-microscopic studies showed that the FITC&hyph;D diffused
across damaged type I pneumocyte membranes and cytoplasm to reach the basal lamina and entered the alveolar capillaries
through the endothelial junction. Damage to alveolar epithelium was more frequent for the smoke-exposed animals
than the room air-exposed animals.

Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) participates in the activation of various carcinogens, such as benzo(a)pyrene.
This is one of the many carcinogens found in ETS. Both mainstream and sidestream smoke are capable of inducing pulmonary
AHH activity. Gairola [Ex. 114] has demonstrated the induction of pulmonary AHH activity in Sprague-Dawley rats
and male C57BL mice after exposure to either mainstream or sidestream smoke from University of Kentucky Reference
cigarettes (2R1) for seven days per week for 16 weeks. However, no such induction was noted in Hartley guinea-pigs
under similar conditions, indicating a species difference. The mainstream and the sidestream smoke were equally
effective in inducing the AHH activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is consistent evidence that decrements in pulmonary function and increases in respiratory symptoms occur
in current smokers and in exsmokers. However, in passive smokers these health effects are not as easily demonstrated.
The Environmental Protection Agency's December 1992 report, Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung
Cancer and Other Disorders [Ex. 4&hyph;311], reviewed an abundance of evidence showing persistent physiologic
changes in children's respiratory function and related health effects as a result of exposure to ETS. Studies evaluating
these same effects are not as plentiful in adults. However, the EPA concluded, ``recent evidence suggests that passive
smoking has subtle but statistically significant effects on the respiratory health of adults'' [Ex. 4&hyph;311].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The weight of the evidence shows that exposure to ETS results in decreases in pulmonary function indices and increases
in respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy men and women who are exposed to ETS for periods of 10 or more years. The
risk of developing COPD appears to be increased in passive smokers with lifelong exposures to ETS. Whether these changes
impact upon respiratory function to a degree that impairment occurs may be dependent upon the individual's pulmonary
status and overall health condition.

4. Cardiovascular Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A developing body of research indicates that the cardiovascular effects of ETS exposure on the health of nonsmokers
include acute effects, such as exacerbation of angina, as well as chronic effects, such as atherosclerosis [Exs.
4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;291, 4&hyph;330]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cardiovascular diseases [Exs. 4&hyph;91, 4&hyph;136] such as myocardial infarction [Ex. 4&hyph;12], sudden death,
and arterial thrombosis occur more frequently in cigarette smokers as opposed to nonsmokers [Exs. 4&hyph;86, 4&hyph;233].
The same chemicals which produce these effects in active smokers are present in ETS. These include nicotine, carbon
monoxide, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and tobacco glycoproteins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion on cardiovascular effects covers thrombus formation, vascular wall injury and the possible
mechanisms of these effects in nonsmokers. Discussion of the acute and chronic health effects follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Thrombus Formation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Blood clots in the coronary arteries are an important component of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). An additional
component of the acute MI is the presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the walls of the coronary arteries. Platelets
are involved in both the acute formation of blood clots and the chronic formation of atherosclerotic plaques. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is evidence that ETS exposure can cause platelets to become more easily activated thus predisposing the platelets
to become involved in forming clots and atherosclerotic plaques. For example, evidence exists that demonstrates
that the platelets of nonsmokers exposed to ETS are more easily activated [Exs. 4&hyph;40, 4&hyph;80]. The study
by Burghuber [Exs. 4&hyph;40] demonstrates that the platelet activating capabilities of ETS are more prominent
in nonsmokers than in smokers. The results of this study suggest that nonsmokers are at a greater risk of blood clot
formation secondary to ETS exposure than smokers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acute ETS exposure also results in an increased platelet aggregation, which is an initial stage of the development
of coronary thrombosis or vasoconstriction. This vasoconstriction can lead to the development of coronary atherosclerosis
after chronic exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;111, 4&hyph;123, 4&hyph;272]. Environmental smoke exposure also can increase
platelet-activating factor (PAF), platelet factor 4, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinogen concentration which
provides a marker of its effect on coronary heart disease [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;157, 4&hyph;224].

(b) Vascular Wall Injury. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Atherosclerotic plaque formation is a complicated chronic process that can lead to constriction of the lumen of the
blood vessels, resulting in reduced blood supply to the myocardial tissues. It is thought that an essential step in
plaque formation is injury to the endothelial lining of the arterial wall. ETS has been implicated in causing injury
to the endothelial cells which line the arterial walls. This was demonstrated in the study by Davis et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;80]
which identified an increase in the number of endothelial cell carcasses in the circulation of healthy people after
being exposed to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ETS has also been implicated in stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation and in altering blood lipids. Each of
these can contribute to plaque formation which leads to an increased susceptibility to heart attacks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(c) Possible Mechanisms of Effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At least three mechanisms are described in the literature by which ETS may place stress on the heart by increasing myocardial
oxygen demand, decreasing myocardial oxygen supply or interfering with the cell's ability to utilize oxygen for
energy production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One mechanism by which ETS may reduce oxygen supply is through the formation of carboxyhemoglobin. Carboxyhemoglobin
is formed when a person is exposed to carbon monoxide, a component of ETS. The carbon monoxide effectively competes
with oxygen for the heme group of the hemoglobin molecule in the red blood cell (RBC). In fact, carbon monoxide has a
much greater affinity for hemoglobin than does oxygen and binds very strongly with hemoglobin making it unavailable
for the transport of oxygen. The heart muscle (myocardium) can experience injury at the cellular level when the oxygen
demanded by the heart muscle exceeds the oxygen supplied by the blood. Therefore, the formation of carboxyhemoglobin
can decrease the ability of the blood to deliver oxygen to the myocardium and can cause injury to the heart if myocardial
oxygen demand exceeds supply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of studies have suggested that ETS exposure adversely affects the myocardial oxygen supply-demand relationship;
this would predispose the heart to develop ischemia or exacerbate preexisting ischemia. Direct or indirect exposure
to tobacco smoke has been shown to increase the hemodynamic determinants of myocardial oxygen demand [Exs. 4&hyph;13,
4&hyph;242] at the same time that it potentially reduces both myocardial oxygen supply and delivery by enhancing
the development of coronary atherosclerosis [Exs. 4&hyph;242, 4&hyph;323], causing coronary vasoconstriction
[Exs. 4&hyph;323, 4&hyph;324] and reducing the oxygen carrying capacity of blood through increased carboxyhemoglobin
levels [Ex. 4&hyph;13]. As a result, fewer red blood cells are available to transport oxygen to the body, and to the
heart muscle itself. To compensate for this reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, the heart must work harder,
for example, by increasing the heart rate. This is an example of one mechanism by which ETS may place even further stress
on the heart by increasing myocardial oxygen demand, precisely at a time when the oxygen delivery capabilities of
the blood are reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second mechanism by which ETS may increase myocardial oxygen demand is via the direct effect of nicotine. The nicotine
in ETS may cause an increased resting heart rate and blood pressure in exposed individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One study examined the effects of ETS on healthy individuals during exercise, and found that healthy individuals
experienced fatigue at lower work levels when exercising in the presence of ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;123]. The authors concluded
that ETS exposure interfered with the heart muscle cells' ability to utilize oxygen for energy production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, ETS exposure may have an adverse impact on myocardial metabolism and expose the heart muscle to an increased
susceptibility to injury. These mechanisms of cardiac stress and potential injury to the heart are in agreement with
accepted theories of cardiac injury.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(d) Acute Heart Effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An acute effect of exposure to ETS is the aggravation of existing heart conditions, such as angina. The National Research
Council (1986) reported, based on the effects of studies by Anderson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;9] and Aronow et al. [Exs. 4&hyph;14,
4&hyph;16, 4&hyph;17], that angina patients are especially sensitive at carboxyhemoglobin levels between 2 and
4%. Guerin et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;129] report that physiologically adverse effects occur in humans at 2.5% carboxyhemoglobin
blood content. Cumulative carbon monoxide levels, due to ETS that result in such an effect are not uncommon in work
environments [Ex. 4&hyph;129]. Acute exposure to ETS has been reported to increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure,
and increase carboxyhemoglobin levels in both angina patients [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 4&hyph;222] and in healthy subjects
[Exs. 4&hyph;18, 4&hyph;217]. Acute exposure has also been associated with slight changes in blood components thought
to be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, such as endothelial cell count, platelet aggregate ratio,
and platelet sensitivity to prostacyclin [Exs. 4&hyph;40, 4&hyph;80]. Many effects of ETS exposure, such as ischemia,
may be additionally aggravated by simultaneous exposure to other compounds, such as solvents [Exs. 3&hyph;446,
4&hyph;99].

(e) Chronic Heart Effects. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The occurrence of coronary heart disease in ETS-exposed nonsmokers has been studied by various epidemiological
researchers [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;120, 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;139, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;154,
4&hyph;191, 4&hyph;277, 4&hyph;295]. Small, but statistically significant (at p &gt; 0.05), increases in coronary
heart disease mortality [Exs. 4&hyph;85, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;139, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;277] indicate a modest impact
of long-term ETS tobacco smoke exposure on the cardiovascular health of nonsmokers. The relative risks calculated
in these studies ranged from 1.3 to 2.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of ETS exposure to induce coronary heart disease has also been studied in animals. Zhu et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;330]
exposed rats to ETS and showed a dose-related increase in myocardial infarct size and a decrease in bleeding time.
But there were no significant differences in serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein and cholesterol. This
study showed that air nicotine, carbon monoxide, and total particulate concentrations increased with ETS exposure,
and this increased exposure led to a continuous increase in plasma carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine levels
in ETS-exposed rats. There was a positive relationship between the infarct size and air nicotine, carbon monoxide,
total particulate concentrations and plasma carboxyhemoglobin, nicotine, and cotinine levels. The average concentrations
of air nicotine, carbon monoxide and particulates, according to the authors, were 30-fold, 3-fold and 10- fold higher,
respectively, than in a heavy smoking environment. The duration of exposure, however, was short compared to even
a rat's lifetime. Infarct size nearly doubled following only 180 hours of ETS exposure distributed over a six week
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the same study, the effect of ETS exposure on platelet function and aortic and pulmonary artery atherosclerosis
in New Zealand male rabbits was demonstrated. The increase of atherosclerosis after exposure to ETS was shown to be
independent of changes in serum lipids and exhibited a dose-response relationship in this study. Average air nicotine,
carbon monoxide and total particulate concentrations were 1,040 &mu;g/m3, 60.2 ppm and 32.8 mg/m3 for high dose group
and 30 &mu;g/m3, 18.8 ppm and 4.0 mg/m3 for low dose group and &lt;1 &mu;g/m3, 3.1 ppm and 0.13 mg/m3 for the control group.
Atherosclerosis in this study was significantly increased in the high dose group.

Olsen [Ex. 245] exposed rats daily to smoke from University of Kentucky 2R1 Reference cigarettes for 10 minutes, 7
times a week for 4, 8 or 20 weeks. Sidestream (SS) smoke was collected by a moving column of air spiked every minute with
a puff of fresh mainstream (MS) smoke. Rats were exposed to this SS smoke collected in a 2 L/min air flow using a glass
container placed over a burning cigarette. A fraction of this air flow containing SS smoke was diluted with fresh room
air and continuously diverted to the rats as follows: 50%, 25% and 10% SS smoke. Carboxyhemoglobin content for each
treatment group was determined immediately after the last smoke exposure and percent carboxyhemoglobin for each
group was found to be: 4 week exposure-mainstream=7.2

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Research has shown that passive exposure to tobacco smoke damages endothelial cells and increases the number of circulating
anuclear carcasses of endothelial cells [Ex. 4&hyph;80]. ETS appears to alter cardiac cellular metabolism in such
a way that renders the myocyte less capable of producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Reduced oxidative phosphorylation
in cardiac mitochondrial fractions taken from rabbits exposed to ETS has been demonstrated [Ex. 4&hyph;130]. Studies
have indicated that the reduction in mitochondrial respiration secondary to ETS exposure is likely due to decreased
cytochrome oxidase activity [Exs. 4&hyph;130, 4&hyph;131]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nicotine, a component of tobacco smoke, has been shown in in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
studies, to inhibit the release of prostacyclin, through inhibition of cyclooxygenase, from the rings of rabbit
or rat aorta. Nicotine could also affect platelets by releasing catecholamines which lead to increased thromboxane
A2 [Ex. 4&hyph;25]. Passive smoke also increases blood viscosity and hematocrit due to relative hypoxia induced
by chronic carbon monoxide exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;25]. Nicotine, contained in cigarette smoke can lead to catecholamine
release, which enhances platelet adhesiveness and decreases the ventricular fibrillation threshold. This threshold
is also affected by carbon monoxide levels [Exs. 4&hyph;25, 4&hyph;196]. Cigarette smoke also increases the lipolysis
that increases levels of plasma free fatty acids, which result in enhanced synthesis of LDL [Ex. 4&hyph;234]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, there are multiple pathways by which ETS may damage the heart. ETS exposure has been demonstrated to
both increase myocardial oxygen demand and decrease myocardial oxygen supply. If oxygen demand exceeds supply for
a long enough period of time, then myocardial cell injury or even cell death can occur. In addition, ETS exposure may
cause platelets to become less sensitive to the anti-clotting regulatory substances in the blood and therefore increase
the tendency of the blood to clot. An increased tendency for the blood to clot may lead to an increased susceptibility
to heart attacks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ETS exposure may also contribute to the chronic formation of arterial wall plaques which are implicated in the event
of an acute myocardial infarction. The two mechanisms described by which ETS exposure may stimulate plaque formation
are endothelial cell injury and increased platelet activation. Different people will have different abilities
to deal with the increased stress on the heart and the increased tendency of the blood to clot as a result of ETS exposure.
For example, a young, otherwise healthy individual may be able to tolerate short-term ETS exposure without apparent
difficulty, although asymptomatic arterial wall injury may occur which can contribute to cardiac injury in the future.
However, an older person with pre-existing coronary artery disease and therefore minimum cardiac reserve may not
be able to tolerate short-term ETS exposure, due to the increased stress on the heart.

5. Reproductive Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data on the reproductive effects due to the exposure of nonsmoking pregnant women to ETS has been presented in many
studies [Exs. 3&hyph;438, 4&hyph;92, 4&hyph;132, 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;208, 4&hyph;273, 4&hyph;285, 4&hyph;287,
4&hyph;299]. This is important since many nonsmoking women continue to work throughout their pregnancies. Pregnant
women working in indoor environments without tobacco smoking restrictions, as in restaurants, comprise one of the
most heavily ETS-exposed groups [Exs. 4&hyph;151, 4&hyph;287]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low birthweight has also been shown to be associated with paternal smoking, implying passive exposure to tobacco
smoke by the nonsmoking mother [Exs. 4&hyph;92, 4&hyph;273]. Passive exposure to tobacco smoke is estimated to double
the risk of low birthweight in a full-term baby [Ex. 4&hyph;208]. Nonsmoking pregnant women who are exposed to ETS
have been reported to deliver neonates that range 24 to 120 grams lighter in weight than those babies delivered by nonexposed
pregnant women [Exs. 4&hyph;132, 4&hyph;174, 4&hyph;208, 4&hyph;273]. This relationship between passive smoking
and low birthweight remains statistically significant even after accounting for mother's age, parity, social class,
sex of baby, and alcohol consumption. This effect is more apparent in neonates born to actively smoking women who deliver
babies that weigh, on average, 200 grams less than those of nonsmoking women [Ex. 4&hyph;101]. The reduction in birthweight
is clinically significant at the low end of the birthweight distribution. These infants have higher perinatal mortality
[Ex. 4&hyph;239]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other reproductive effects that have been ascribed to maternal ETS exposure include miscarriage, an increase in
congenital abnormalities [Exs. 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;299], and numerous other physiological effects [Ex. 4&hyph;297].
It was reported that these effects may be part of a general immunosuppressive condition associated with the occurrence
of low birthweight [Ex. 4&hyph;299]. This effect may predispose the baby to respiratory tract infections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects of environmental smoke exposure on the fetus may have long-term sequelae into childhood and adulthood
[Exs. 4&hyph;53, 4&hyph;181, 4&hyph;213, 4&hyph;225, 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;51, 4&hyph;297]. There is limited evidence
which suggests that growth retardation observed in the fetus is reflected in the growing child as reductions in lung
development [3&hyph;438]. This is especially relevant if that child continues to be exposed to ETS throughout childhood
and into adulthood [Exs. 4&hyph;177, 4&hyph;297]. Prenatal exposure to ETS and exposure to ETS as a child may also
increase an individual's cancer risk, perhaps by a factor of two (2) [Exs. 4&hyph;65, 4&hyph;164, 4&hyph;252]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experimental research on the adverse reproductive effects associated with ETS exposure in animals is limited. However,
one study [Ex. 4&hyph;6] demonstrated such effects. Sciatic nerve tissue taken from the offspring of ETS-exposed
female mice revealed definite toxic effects on the neonatal tissue [Ex. 4&hyph;6]. Pregnant female mice (C57BL/KsJ)
were exposed to low-tar cigarette smoke in a special smoking chamber. Cigarette smoke was blown into the chamber for
4 minutes, 5 times daily, except on weekends when this was done 3 times daily. At 18 days of gestation, blood samples
were taken and carbon monoxide levels were measured. Ultrastructural abnormalities of fetal tissue revealed swollen
mitochondria with distorted cristae, some indication of deformed mitochondria, darkened nuclei with condensations
of nuclear material, lamellar bodies, granules and myelin bodies similar to those found in human toxicity studies.
The blood samples from pregnant mice revealed a mean carbon monoxide saturation in the hemoglobin of 9% which is equivalent
to that found in humans who actively smoke 10&hyph;20 cigarettes per day.

Concern over the carcinogenic effects of ETS was expressed in many comments submitted to the docket, such as Exs. 3&hyph;32,
3&hyph;35, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;207, 3&hyph;438, 3&hyph;440A, and 3&hyph;449. The results of epidemiological and
experimental studies indicate that exposure to ETS is causally associated with cancer of the lung in chronically-exposed
nonsmokers. A discussion of this evidence follows.

(a) Evidence of Association._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of epidemiological studies taken in the aggregate suggest that nonsmoker exposure to ETS is causally-related
to the development of lung cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evidence of specificity of effect is provided by active smoking studies that report a causal association with lung
cancer [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. It was therefore logical to examine nonsmokers with passive exposure to tobacco smoke,
since the chemicals found in passive smoke are qualitatively similar to those in mainstream smoke. Active smoking
induces all four major histological types of human lung cancer_squamous-cell carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas,
large-cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. The results of lung cancer studies that examined
the variation in tumor cell type induced by ETS exposure indicate that mostly adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas
are produced by ETS exposure. Some studies have reported an excess of adenocarcinomas, while others have reported
excesses in squamous cell and small-cell carcinomas. From this information, it is apparent that similar tumor cell
types are induced by ETS exposure as are induced by active smoking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The unequivocal causal association between active tobacco smoking and lung cancer in humans, as well as the corroborative
evidence of the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke provided by animal bioassays and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vitro 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
studies and the chemical similarity between mainstream smoke and ETS, clearly establish the plausibility that ETS
is also a human lung carcinogen (Table II&hyph;2). In addition, biomarker studies verify that ETS exposure results
in detectable uptake of tobacco constituents by nonsmokers [Exs. 4&hyph;50, 4&hyph;311].

(b) Epidemiological and Experimental Studies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. There are at least 32 epidemiological studies that have attempted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ETS.
OSHA analyzed these studies and determined that 14 were positive for an association [Exs. 4&hyph;36, 4&hyph;65,
4&hyph;106, 4&hyph;119, 4&hyph;121, 4&hyph;142, 4&hyph;143, 4&hyph;153, 4&hyph;158, 4&hyph;187, 4&hyph;252,
4&hyph;275, 4&hyph;276, 4&hyph;292, 4&hyph;300], 5 were equivocal with a positive trend [Exs. 4&hyph;4, 4&hyph;47,
4&hyph;117, 4&hyph;122, 4&hyph;171], and 13 were equivocal [Exs. 4&hyph;35, 4&hyph;38, 4&hyph;52, 4&hyph;118,
4&hyph;148, 4&hyph;164, 4&hyph;175, 4&hyph;183, 4&hyph;192, 4&hyph;283, 4&hyph;286, 4&hyph;296, 4&hyph;326].
[See the Risk Assessment section for further discussion.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA considered the consistency of the association to determine if the finding of the same exposure effect occurred
in different populations and different types of studies. The great number of epidemiological studies available
on ETS were conducted by different researchers, on different populations, in various countries with diverse study
designs. This extensive amount of data increases confidence that the associations seen between ETS exposure and
the development of lung cancer is externally consistent and is not due to artifacts or a product of some unidentified,
indirect factors unlikely to be common to all of the studies. The fact that exposure to ETS is common dilutes the risk
estimates derived from these studies because the comparison group has some exposure to ETS. A recent Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) report [Ex. 4&hyph;50] found that 100% of a subset of the National Health and Nutrition
Evaluation Survey (NHANES) III conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics had detectable levels of cotinine
in their bodies indicating that everyone in the sample had detectable exposure to tobacco smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;50].
Cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine and is used as a surrogate of exposure to tobacco smoke. This indicates that the
cancer risk may indeed be greater since the relationship in these studies has been more exposed versus less exposed
instead of exposed versus nonexposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many potential sources of bias, such as publication bias (the tendency of scientific journals to publish studies
with positive results), misclassification bias (smokers or former smokers claiming to be nonsmokers), and recall
bias (the reliance on self-reporting of both personal smoking habits and exposure to others' tobacco smoke) can not
account for the elevation in risks seen in these various studies. Also, the relative risks that were estimated from
prospective study data are similar to those estimated from case/control study data. Biases that may be problematic
to case-control studies are not a problem in prospective studies. Since the results from both types of studies are
similar it is apparent that these biases are not important in the case-control studies (e.g., misclassification
bias and recall bias). This information strengthens the confidence of a causal connection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animal studies have shown the carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke. Limited existing data suggest that sidestream
smoke may contain more carcinogenic activity per milligram of cigarette smoke concentrate than does mainstream
smoke [Ex. 3&hyph;689D]. Currently, OSHA is aware of only a few experimental inhalation studies with sidestream
smoke or ETS reported in the literature. A discussion of these studies follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Otto and Elmenhorst [Ex. 4&hyph;247] have shown that there are carcinogenic constituents in the vapor phase of tobacco
smoke. They exposed C57B1 and BLH mice to the gas phase of cigarette mainstream smoke of 12 cigarettes for 90 minutes
daily over 27 months. The particulate matter was removed by passing the smoke through a Cambridge filter. The percentages
of mice with lung adenomas were 5.5% and 32% in the smoke-exposed C57B1 and BLH mice, as compared to 3.4% and 22% for their
respective controls. Leuchtenberger and Leuchtenberger [Ex. 4&hyph;197] have also shown that the rate of tumors
among mice exposed to the gas phase was greater than animals exposed to the whole smoke. Pulmonary adenomas and adenocarcinomas
were induced in Snell's mice by the gas phase but not by the whole smoke in this study. These studies demonstrate that
the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke is not limited to the particulate phase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have also reported hyperplasia and metaplasia in the trachea and bronchi of mice exposed to cigarette smoke
by the inhalation route [Exs. 4&hyph;226, 4&hyph;327]. Four lung tumors and emphysema were detected in 100 male and
female C57B1 mice exposed, nose only, to fresh mainstream smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;135]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pulmonary squamous neoplasms were detected in female Wistar rats exposed to a 1:5 smoke-to-air mixture for 15 seconds
of every minute during an 11 minute exposure twice a day, 5 days per week, for the lifespan of the animals [Ex. 4&hyph;79].
Respiratory tumors were also observed in Fischer&hyph;344 rats exposed, nose only, to a 1:10 smoke to air mixture
for approximately 30 seconds every minute, 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 128 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;77]. The incidence
of laryngeal leukoplakias in Syrian golden hamsters ranged from 11.3% for the animals that received the low dose to
30.6% of those animals that received the highest dose. These animals were exposed to a 1:7 smoke-to-air mixture for
10 to 30 minutes, 5 days a week, nose only, for a period of up to 52 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;88]. Exposing hamsters twice a day,
5 days a week for up to 100 weeks resulted in almost 90% of the exposed hamsters having hyperplastic or neoplastic changes
in the larynx in a study by Bernfeld et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;30]. Lung tumors have been reported in beagle dogs exposed to
the smoke from nonfilter cigarettes [Ex. 4&hyph;19]. However, no tumors were seen in rabbits exposed to cigarette
smoke for up to 51/2 years [Ex. 4&hyph;149]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sidestream condensates have also been shown to cause carcinogenicity when implanted into female Osborne-Mendel
rat lungs [Ex. 4&hyph;127]. Cigarette smoke condensate fraction from sidestream smoke was implanted at a dose level
of one cigarette per animal in this study.

Coggins et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;59] reported epithelial hyperplasia in the nasal cavity of high-dosed rats exposed to
environmental tobacco smoke. They exposed Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes, nose only, to ``aged and diluted sidestream
smoke'' (ADSS) at 0.1, 1 or 10 mg of particulates per meter for 14 days and found ``slight to mild'' epithelial hyperplasia
and inflammation in the most rostral part of the nasal cavity in the 10 mg group only. They also found that these changes
were reversible if the animals were kept without further exposure for an additional 14 days. No effects in the lung
were reported. Similar results of mild hyperplasia were also obtained when male rats were exposed to the same concentrations
for up to 13 weeks [Ex. 4&hyph;60]. In this study the authors reported hypercellularity and the thickening of the respiratory
epithelium of the dorsal nasal conchae and adjacent wall of the middle meatus.

Rats are obligatory nose-breathers, and the anatomy and physiology of the respiratory tract and the biochemistry
of the lung differ between rodents and humans. Because of these distinctions, laboratory animals and humans are likely
to have different deposition and exposure patterns for the various cigarette smoke components in the respiratory
system. For example, rodents have extensive and complex nasal turbinates where significant particle deposition
could occur, decreasing exposure to the lung. These anatomical and physiological differences, aside from the subchronic
exposure, may partially account for absence of any lung tumors in the study by Coggins et al.

The application of cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) to mouse skin is a widely employed assay for the evaluation of
carcinogenic potential. CSC assays may not, however, reveal all of the carcinogenic activity of actual cigarette
smoke, because these condensates lack most of the volatile and semi-volatile components of whole smoke. Benign skin
tumors and carcinomas were seen in Swiss-ICR mice exposed to cigarette tar from the sidestream smoke of nonfilter
cigarettes suspended in acetone and applied to skin for 15 months [Ex. 4&hyph;327]. In lifetime rat studies, intrapulmonary
implants of mainstream smoke condensate in a lipid vehicle caused a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of lung
carcinomas [Exs. 4&hyph;75, 4&hyph;289]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The polyamines contained in tobacco smoke, spermidine, spermine, and their diamine precursor, putrescine, are
believed to have an essential role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Formation of putrescine from
ornithine is catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis.
A significant increase in lung and trachea ornithine decarboxylase activity was observed by Olsen [Ex. 4&hyph;245]
after an eight week exposure of male Sprague-Dawley rats to MS smoke. All dilutions of SS smoke exposure caused significant
increase in trachea ODC activity but did not influence the lung ODC activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental tobacco smoke induced carcinogenicity is also supported by a case-control study of lung cancer in
pet dogs [Ex. 4&hyph;259]. The study compared the incidence of lung cancer in pet dogs exposed to their owners' smoking
versus dogs whose owners did not smoke. Dogs have a very low natural incidence of lung cancer. There was an elevated
risk of lung cancer (Relative Risk = 1.6) observed in pets with smoking owners. However, the analysis was statistically
insignificant, perhaps in part due to small sample size.

Short-term mutagenicity tests have gained widespread acceptance as an initial step in the identification of potential
carcinogens. Extensive use of these tests has come about because they are easy to perform and are inexpensive and also
because of the reported high positive correlations between short-term mutagenicity tests and carcinogenicity.
It has been reported that 90 percent of the carcinogens tested are mutagens and 90 percent of the noncarcinogens are
nonmutagens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several short-term bioassays have been performed to evaluate the genotoxicity of cigarette smoke. While most of
them have evaluated the effect of cigarette smoke condensate, some have attempted to evaluate either the gas phase
or the whole smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most commonly employed assay for mutagenic activity employs various strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Whole smoke as well as cigarette smoke condensate of tobacco have been shown to be mutagenic in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 strain TA 1538 [Ex. 4&hyph;21]. Sidestream smoke was also found to be mutagenic in a system where the smoke was tested
directly on the bacterial plates [Ex. 4&hyph;246]. Sidestream smoke and extracts of ETS collected from indoor air
[Exs. 4&hyph;202, 4&hyph;5, 4&hyph;198, 4&hyph;201, 4&hyph;203] also exhibited mutagenic activity in this bacterial
strain. Claxton et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;55] found that sidestream smoke accounted for approximately 60% of the total 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. typhimurium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mutagenicity per cigarette, 40% from the sidestream smoke particulates and 20% from the semi-volatiles. The highly
volatile fraction, from either mainstream or sidestream smoke was not mutagenic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Condensates from both mainstream [Exs. 4&hyph;89, 4&hyph;193] and sidestream smoke [Ex. 4&hyph;90] have also been
reported to have mutagenic activity. Doolittle et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;89] demonstrated the genotoxicity of the sidestream
smoke from the Kentucky Reference cigarette (1R4F) by employing several different assays. In their study, sidestream
smoke produced positive results in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
strains TA98, TA100, TA1537, and TA1538 in the presence of S9 mix from aroclor-induced rat liver but produced negative
results in strain TA1535. They also showed that sidestream smoke produced positive results in the Chinese hamster
ovary cells chromosomal aberration assay and in the Chinese hamster ovary cell sister-chromatid exchange assay
both with and without metabolic activation. They demonstrated that the sidestream smoke was weakly positive in inducing
DNA repair in cultured rat hepatocytes. However, sidestream smoke was nonmutagenic in the Chinese hamster ovary
cell-HGPRT assay both with and without metabolic activation but it was found to be cytotoxic in this system.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In their further studies, Doolittle et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;90] observed similar responses when they measured the genotoxic
activity of mainstream cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) from Kentucky reference research cigarette (1R4F). As
seen with sidestream smoke, CSC in this study was mutagenic in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
strain TA98, TA100, TA1537, and TA1538 in the presence of S9 mix but was negative in strain TA1535. CSC was also positive
in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells-chromosomal aberration assay and in the CHO-sister-chromatid exchange
assay both with and without metabolic activation. CSC was weakly positive in inducing DNA repair in cultured rat hepatocytes.
However, again as seen with sidestream smoke, CSC was nonmutagenic in the CHO&hyph;HGPRT assay, with or without metabolic
activation but was found to be cytotoxic in this system. The results from these two studies appear to indicate that
sidestream smoke behaves very much like mainstream smoke in these assays.

Mohtashamipur et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;227] demonstrated significant mutagenic activity in the urine of rats exposed
to sidestream smoke. In this study, cigarettes were machine smoked under standardized laboratory conditions and
the sidestream smoke of two cigarettes was directed through metabolism cages containing rats. The urine of these
rats was collected 24 hours prior to the SS exposure and 24 hours after the onset of the exposure. The individual urine
samples of all (10) rats after exposure showed significantly higher activity for direct-acting mutagens (in strain
TA1538) than the urine samples of the same rats before the exposure.

The formation of DNA adducts is widely accepted as an initial step in the carcinogenesis process. The measurement
of DNA adducts by the 32P-postlabeling assay has been used as a way to assess DNA damage following exposure to cigarette
smoke. Lee et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;194] exposed Sprague-Dawley rats to 0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg total particulate matter/m3 of
aged and diluted sidestream smoke (ADSS) for 6 hours per day for 14 consecutive days. They examined the DNA from lung,
heart, larynx and liver after 7 and 14 days of exposure and after 14 days of recovery. They also examined alveolar macrophages
for chromosomal aberrations. Exposure related DNA adducts were found in the highest dose test. However, no elevation
in chromosomal aberrations was observed in alveolar macrophages in this study. Similar results were also obtained
when animals were exposed to the same three concentrations for up to 90 days. DNA adducts were seen in lung, heart and
larynx DNA of the animals exposed to the highest concentration of ADSS [Ex. 4&hyph;195]. The adduct levels were highest
after 90 days of exposure and were significantly reduced in all target tissues 90 days after cessation of exposure.
Again, chromosomal aberrations in alveolar macrophages were not elevated in any group after 90 days of exposure.
The authors concluded that the concentration of DNA adducts formed in the lung tissue did not increase linearly as
the ADSS concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mg.

Several short-term tests have been performed in eukaryotic systems. A solution of the gas phase of mainstream cigarette
smoke has been shown to induce reciprocal mitotic recombination in

[Ex. 4&hyph;113]. Transformation of mammalian cells was induced in several cell systems using the cigarette smoke
condensate from mainstream cigarette smoke [Exs. 4&hyph;22, 4&hyph;161, 4&hyph;188, 4&hyph;267, 4&hyph;268,

assay that measures the number of sister-chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced has been employed widely to determine
the mutagenic activity of cigarette smoke. Valadand-Berrieu and Izard [Ex. 4&hyph;313] used a solution of the gas
phase from cigarette mainstream smoke and showed that this solution induced a significant dose-related increase
in sister-chromatid exchanges. Putman et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;257] have also demonstrated dose-dependent increases
in sister chromatid exchange frequencies in bone-marrow cells of mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 2 weeks.

Review of the literature clearly demonstrates that MS smoke and ETS exposure causes cancer in humans. These results
are supported not only by animal studies but also by studies that show SS smoke to be both genotoxic and clastogenic.

The epidemiological and clinical studies, taken in aggregate, indicate that exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke may produce mucous membrane irritation, pulmonary, cardiovascular, reproductive, and carcinogenic effects
in nonsmokers. Exposure to ETS may aggravate existing pulmonary or cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers. In addition,
animal studies show that both mainstream and sidestream tobacco smoke produce similar adverse effects.

1. Sick Building Syndrome and Building-Related Illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many case reports of material impairment of health due to occupational exposure to poor IAQ have been reported to OSHA
through submission to the indoor air quality docket [H&hyph;122]. These adverse health effects range from irritation
effects to more severe, life-threatening building-related illnesses, such as Legionnaire's disease, and cancer.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford Motor Company responded in docket comment 3&hyph;447, that ``[p]resently, at Ford, we investigate an average
of two IAQ complaints per month which are predominantly classified as Sick Building Syndrome. We have seen Building-Related
Illness, but these incidents have been rare and associated with specific contaminant episodes. The IAQ complaints
we generally investigate are characterized by general malaise, headache, and flu-like symptoms that are said to
disappear when the occupants leave the building&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;Of the IAQ problems investigated,
about 20 percent can be attributed to PTS [passive tobacco smoke]/ETS. Upper respiratory irritation or eye irritation
typically are associated with these complaints.'' Similar types of health effects were reported to the agency in
docket comments 3&hyph;1, 3&hyph;22, 3&hyph;58, 3&hyph;142C, 3&hyph;367, 3&hyph;413, 3&hyph;529, 3&hyph;632,
3&hyph;634, 3&hyph;642, 3&hyph;659, and 3&hyph;698. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment [Ex. 3&hyph;433 reported that ``based upon approximately 30 IAQ investigations in a member company over
the past two and one-half years, the following adverse health effects have been reported in office environments:
eye, nose, and throat irritations; headaches, nausea, dizziness, fatigue; cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness.
These so-called ``sick building syndrome (SBS)'' symptoms often disappear when the person leaves the building environment.
These symptoms are usually subjective and non-specific, lacking a physician's diagnosis of a definite illness.''
Others have reported [Ex. 3&hyph;377] that ``as air flow and ventilation are cut back, our workers are becoming sick.
Many are exposed to contaminants or other harmful substances; and, without ventilation, these sources linger and
cause nausea, skin irritations and other unhealthy symptoms of illness. In severe cases, these contaminants and
bacteria have been known to contribute to upper respiratory infections.'' Comment 3&hyph;570 reported similar
health effects due to poor indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More serious health conditions have been reported ranging from severe asthma to central nervous systems disorders.
For example, Comment 3&hyph;158 responded that ``I have developed a serious asthma condition due to indoor air quality
problems. Besides, three of the remaining five employees at the branch office have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue
syndrome. In conversations with various health care professionals, I have come to the conclusion that the diagnoses
of chronic fatigue syndrome were actually sick building syndrome. Of the six employees at the branch office, four
of the six are moderate to heavy smokers. This does not take into consideration the other factors that could be causing
poor indoor air quality problems in the office.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 3&hyph;631 was a collection of reports from the workers in one building that illustrate the poor conditions
of a building that can lead to serious health effects in workers. Health problems experienced by workers in this building
included chronic sinus infections; headaches; fatigue; eye, nose and throat irritations; difficulty breathing
and congestion; allergies; and asthma. These health problems seem to clear up when the workers were out of the building
over a weekend or a vacation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The physical condition of this building was obviously in disrepair since the commenters reported pails of stagnant
water, collected from leaks in the roof, were left in hallways. Water in ``[t]hese pails ha[d] overflowed and run down
the stairs. What [wa]s left in the pails evaporate[d] leaving a gross residue of who knows what.'' The water leaks from
the roof caused mold infestation and water damage. Water logged insulation hung in the ceiling out in a hallway. There
was an obvious lack of routine, sufficient cleaning. Dust and particulate matter were visible in the air. The bathrooms
were dirty. Smells of sewer gas, mold, and diesel and other vehicular fumes permeated the office space. Ventilation
problems were evident since paint or varnish fumes lingered whenever part of the inside physical structure of the
building was painted. Tar fumes were evident from constant patching of the leaky roof. Insect infestation of the building
was evident. Pesticide fumes lingered whenever the building was spray[ed] for roaches and steam bugs. Workers sighted
cockroaches, silverfish, and steam bugs near the coffee shop and on back stairs. The comment continued that ``a sink
faucet in the lunch room has been leaking for years and water runs on the counter under the toaster and microwave. The
water heater had leaked for about 2 months before it was fixed. At that time the carpet was soaked and water was running
under the wall into a supervisor's office. There is a moldy odor from this carpet and the floor below.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cancer has also been reported to be associated with poor indoor air quality. A courthouse in San Diego, California
[Ex. 3&hyph;55], ``is notorious for poor air quality and employee respiratory illness and cancer.'' It was reported
to OSHA that many long-term employees have cancer (stomach and lung cancer), terminal lung disease, chronic ear and
throat infections, and bronchial problems'' [Exs. 3&hyph;585, 3&hyph;635, 3&hyph;637, 3&hyph;68]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 3&hyph;630 from a union reported that ``[a]fter surveying thousands of workers across the country, SEIU
compiled actual survey responses that list adverse health effects caused by indoor air pollution. These include
headaches, nose congestion or irritation, throat irritation, dry cough, dry or itchy skin, dizziness, nausea, lethargy
or fatigue, colds, asthma/wheezing, chest tightness, runny nose/post nasal drip, eye or contact lens irritation,
respiratory difficulties. In addition, EPA estimates that pollutants found in indoor air are responsible for 2,500
to 6,500 cancer deaths each year'' [refer to Ex. 3&hyph;630L].

These concerns are not just relevant to office workers but also to maintenance and other nonindustrial workers that
work in indoor environments. For example, comment 3&hyph;347 responded that ``[i]n our closed, indoor work environments,
air quality is a very real health and safety concern to professional painters. I have seen firsthand otherwise healthy
men and women pass out or get violently ill as a result of being exposed to indoor air contaminants.'' Comment 3&hyph;412
responded ``[o]ur locals have encountered air-pollution problems ranging from ink mist and photocopier emissions
to asbestos and microbial disease. The level of toxic chemical contaminants is often alarmingly high in our darkrooms,
and carbon-monoxide emissions from trucks at newspaper loading docks frequently penetrate the ventilation system.
In 1985 microbial contamination from a water tower infected six New York Times employees with Legionnaires' Disease
and 34 others with less serious respiratory infections.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operation engineers are also affected by poor indoor air quality. Comment 3&hyph;452 responded that ``[t]his is
particularly important for the operation engineers who appear healthy and then suffer from respiratory problems,
much like allergic reactions, after working in a building with poor ventilation.''

2. Environmental Tobacco Smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many case reports of severe material impairment of health due to occupational exposure to ETS have been reported to
OSHA through submission to the indoor air quality docket [H&hyph;122]. Information contained in these comments
indicate that adverse health effects in workers due to environmental tobacco smoke exposure while at work range from
mucous membrane irritation (eye, nose, and throat effects) to more severe, life-threatening conditions, such as
status asthma, other chronic lung diseases and heart diseases. For example, comment 3&hyph;309 responded [Regarding
ETS exposure in a cafeteria], ``By the time I have finished lunch my eyes are tearing, my nose is plugged, and I have a
headache'' as well as comment 3&hyph;315, ``I had fewer headaches and fewer respiratory ailments; my chronic sore
throat disappeared [after a company-wide no smoking policy was implemented]''. Comment 3&hyph;22 responded ``[m]y
patients find it hard to obtain smoke free workplaces. I have seen patients who have suffered status asthma from workplace
smoking, patients who have had to quit their jobs because of ETS in the workplace. Recently, one of my never smoking
patients sustained vocal cord lesions seen almost entirely in smokers.'' Comment 3&hyph;104 continued that ``[p]assive
tobacco smoke (PTS) is the principal indoor air contaminant in my office building in Rockefeller Center. While smoking
is limited to `private offices', the smoke flows freely from these private offices throughout the entire general
office areas since the smokers will not keep their doors closed, and even when they do, they have to come out sometime.
And, as soon as the door is opened, the dense smoke accumulation within the office is diffused to all adjacent work areas.
Because office buildings have closed ventilation systems, only a `smoke free' office policy can be effective. Half
measures only cause further stress, frustration and irritation to both smokers and nonsmokers.'' Comment 3&hyph;289
responded that ``I have been exposed to asbestos culminating in my getting asbestosis (plural plaque) of the lungs.
The combination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of asbestos exposure plus second-hand smoke from my smoking co-workers has posed and is currently posing a health
risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
me.''

III. Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contaminants which contribute to poor indoor air quality can be attributed to both outside air and inside air. Outside
air contaminants can be introduced into a building through the ventilation intakes, doors, building envelope, and
windows. Outside air contaminants include vehicular exhausts, industrial emissions, microbiologicals, and pollen.
Inside air contaminants are emitted from building materials and furnishings, appliances, office equipment and
supplies, biological organisms, and of course, pollutants introduced by the building occupants themselves. Inside
air contaminants include tobacco smoke, volatile organic compounds, combustion gases such as carbon monoxide,
and occupant-generated bioeffluents. The concentration of these contaminants in buildings can increase if ventilation
systems are inadequately designed, maintained and operated or if strong local contaminant sources are not controlled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Sources of Indoor Air Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A wide variety of substances are emitted by building construction materials and interior furnishings, appliances,
office equipment, and supplies, human activities, and biological agents. For example, formaldehyde is emitted
from various wood products, including particle board, plywood, pressed-wood, paneling, some carpeting and backing,
some furniture and dyed materials, urea-formaldehyde insulating foam, some cleaners and deodorizers, and from
press textiles. Volatile organic compounds, including alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, alcohols, aldehydes,
and ketones are emitted from solvents and cleaning compounds, paints, glues, caulks, and resins, spray propellants,
fabric softeners and deodorizers, unvented combustion sources, dry-cleaning fluids, arts and crafts, some fabrics
and furnishings, stored gasoline, cooking, building and roofing materials, waxes and polishing compounds, pens
and markers, binders and plasticizers. Pesticides also contain a variety of toxic organic compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building materials are point sources of emissions that include a variety of VOCs (Table III&hyph;1). Some of these
materials have been linked to indoor air quality problems. The probability of a source emitting contaminants is related
to the age of the material. The newer the material, the higher the potential for emitting contaminants. These materials
include adhesives, carpeting, caulks, glazing compounds, and paints [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. These materials, as well
as furnishings can act as a sponge or sink in which VOCs are absorbed and then re-emitted later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appliances, office equipment, and supplies can emit VOCs and also particulates [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Table III&hyph;2
lists the many contaminants that can be emitted from these point sources. There is an indirect relationship between
the age of the point source and the potential rate of contaminant emission [Ex. 4&hyph;33].

Emissions from equipment, such as computers, will decrease over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time compared to emissions from equipment that continually use chemicals. Emissions from such equipment (e.g.,
laser printers) that use chemicals continually, will obtain a steady state concentration dependent upon the chemicals
used and frequency of equipment use.

B. Microbial Contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Three conditions must exist in buildings before microbial contamination can occur: high humidity (over 60%), appropriate
temperatures (varies according to microbe), and appropriate growth media [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;33]. These conditions
are found in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. HVAC systems provide multiple sites for
microbes to grow (reservoir) and also the means to disperse the microbes throughout the ventilated space. These reservoirs
of microbial growth, if allowed to proliferate unchecked, can lead to indoor air quality problems once the microbes
or microbe-related products, such as endotoxins, are dispersed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building materials that have been soaked with water, such as fiberglass insulation in air handlers, furnishings
and fabrics, ceiling tiles, and carpeting are excellent media for microbial growth. Biological organisms, including
fungal spores, bacteria, viruses, pollens, and protozoa derived from mold growth have been identified in humidifiers
with stagnant water, water damaged surfaces and materials, condensing coils and drip-pans in HVAC systems, drainage
pans in refrigerators, dirty heating coils, and are also associated with mammals, arthopods and insects. Table III&hyph;3
gives examples of biologicals found in indoor environments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various allergens have been associated with the development of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or airway hyperresponsiveness
(Table III&hyph;3) [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Many of these allergens are common to the nonindustrial work environment. These
include chemical volatiles and dusts, arthropods, and dusts, particulates &amp; fibers.

Exposures that cause hypersensitivity reactions include microorganisms, fumes, vapors, and dusts (Table III&hyph;5).
These exposures are associated with the development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis or a less serious variant,
humidifier fever [Ex. 4&hyph;33]. Many of these contaminants are found in the nonindustrial workplace. Birds and
rodents are common pests. Air intakes can be contaminated with bird droppings and other avian-associated problems
when used as nesting sites. These problems can affect the quality of the air being brought into the ventilation system
through these air intakes. Rodent infestations affect work areas directly. Many of the chemicals listed in Table
III&hyph;5 are commonly found in most workplaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, exposure to contaminants in nonindustrial workplaces will vary according to the characteristics of
the building. These include its age, types of materials used in construction and the type of equipment and supplies
that are used by building occupants. The design, maintenance, and operation of the building's HVAC system as well
as the general housekeeping of the building, can greatly influence the levels of contaminants that exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests data on the levels of these contaminants in nonindustrial workplaces.

C. Exposure Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Low-level Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure of susceptible people to low level mixtures of VOCs have induced
mucous membrane irritation and pulmonary effects. Some of these studies are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential of indoor air contamination to produce adverse effects in humans was demonstrated by Molhave et al.
in Denmark [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. These researchers studied 62 subjects suffering from ``indoor climate symptoms''.
These subjects reported primarily eye and upper respiratory tract irritation, but were otherwise healthy individuals
that did not suffer from asthma, allergy, or bronchitis. The subjects were exposed to a mixture of VOCs in concentrations
of 0, 5, or 25 mg/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These concentrations respectively represented ``clean'' air, average polluted air, and the maximum polluted
air in Danish households. After exposure, a Digit Span test was administered. The study found significant declines
in performance on this test; demonstrating that low-level exposures to volatile organic compounds had an adverse
effect on the ability to concentrate [Ex. 4&hyph;20]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Otto et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;248], repeating the Molhave et al. (1984) experiment, studied 66 healthy subjects with no
history of eye and upper respiratory tract irritation. These subjects were exposed at 0 and 25 mg/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 VOC-contaminated air. Otto et al. reported that while subjects found the odor of chemicals unpleasant, to degrade
indoor air quality, to increase headache, and produce general discomfort, VOC exposure for 2.75 hours duration did
not affect performance on any behavioral tests. These results imply that persons who experience symptoms of SBS may
have a lower threshold for certain health effects compared to nonreactive people. This suggests that those with compromised
immune response (e.g. allergy sufferers) may be at elevated risk of SBS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ahlstrom, et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;2] found that synergistic effects may occur when one strong indoor irritant interacts
with other indoor contaminants present at low-level concentrations. Ahlstrom et al. found that there was almost
a 4-fold increase in the perceived odor strength of formaldehyde at low concentration (0.08 ppm) when mixed with 100%
indoor air from a building where SBS was reported, relative to 10% indoor air from the same building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Report of the Canadian Interministerial Committee on Indoor Air Quality [Ex. 4&hyph;264] adopts the World Health
Organization's definition of health: ``Health refers to a state of complete physical, mental, and social well being,
and not just the absence of disease or infirmity.'' This definition was adopted to allow the setting of indoor air quality
guidelines based on ``comfort'' as well as ``health''. The report observes that the symptoms of SBS are sufficiently
general or subjective that they may be indicative of several other medical conditions. Therefore, perhaps the best
indicator that workplace exposure may play a role in the symptoms reported by an individual is the observation that
symptoms worsen during the work day, and disappear shortly after leaving work. They state that because there is a wide
variation in individual susceptibility, based on genetics, age, medication, previous exposure to pollutants,
gender, and state of health, especially those with allergies, that certain individuals may be more sensitive to SBS
than others.

2. Bioaerosols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The levels of bioaerosols in the indoor environment should reflect those found in the outdoor environment. A rank
order assessment, comparing the abundance of microorganisms in the outdoor versus indoor environment is one way
of assessing this relationship [Exs. 3&hyph;61, 4&hyph;229]. If indoor and outdoor sampling results are not comparable,
then it is possible that a reservoir of a particular microbe may be amplifying in the indoor environment; especially
if moisture and a nutrient-rich substrate are available [Ex. 4&hyph;229]. An example of this would be 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commonly found in the outdoor environment, the bacteria are as expected, commonly found in untreated potable and
nonpotable water. Situations can occur that allow these reservoirs to amplify not only in potable water and hot water
service systems but also water used in cooling towers and evaporative condensers [Ex. 4&hyph;229]. Infection occurs
if the bacteria are disseminated, either through the HVAC system or potable water system (e.g., showers) to the breathing
zone of a susceptible person. A healthy individual may develop the less severe Pontiac Fever. An individual that smokes
or is older may develop the more serious pneumonia [Exs. 4&hyph;33, 4&hyph;229].

3. Environmental Tobacco Smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The burning of tobacco in enclosed workplaces releases an aerosol containing a large variety of solid, liquid, and
gas phase chemical compounds. Generation of tobacco smoke is governed by the source emission characteristics of
smokers and their tobacco products, whereas removal is primarily determined by the rate of replacement of building
air by outside air, with re-emission of surface-sorbed compounds playing a minor role. Natural and mechanical ventilation
systems are designed primarily to limit the accumulation of the products of human respiratory metabolism, and secondarily
to limit odor; not to control the byproducts of biomass combustion. Thus, smoking indoors creates air pollution which
is not adequately abated by customary ventilation systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure to tobacco smoke primarily occurs through the inhalation route. Such an exposure can be measured by the determination
of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of tobacco smoke constituents and/or their metabolites.
However, relatively few of these individual constituents have been identified and characterized. Also, measurement
of all components in tobacco smoke is not feasible. Therefore, it becomes necessary to identify a marker which, when
measured, will accurately represent the frequency, duration and magnitude of the exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This discussion reviews available data for the purposes of assessing exposure to ETS in the workplace. Nonsmokers
are exposed to mainstream smoke after it has been exhaled by smokers, and to diluted sidestream smoke. Issues covered
include activity patterns affecting the duration of nonsmokers' exposures, the concentrations of ETS in buildings,
the comparison of ETS components in indoor workplaces, levels of biomarkers in workers, and the inadequacy of general
dilution ventilation to address ETS exposure control. This discussion will indicate not only that exposure occurs,
but that nonsmokers absorb ETS components.

(a) Chemistry.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pipe, cigar, and cigarette smoke all contribute to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) but cigarette smoke is of principal
interest because it is by far the most common. Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7 list some of the known constituents
of tobacco smoke. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combustion of tobacco leads to the formation of mainstream smoke (MS) and sidestream smoke (SS). MS is generated
during puff-drawing in the burning cone and hot zones; it travels through the tobacco column and is inhaled by the smoker.
The smoke which is exhaled by the smoker, while different from the inhaled smoke, is also considered ``mainstream.''
SS is formed in between puff-drawing and is emitted directly from the smoldering tobacco product into the ambient
air.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MS and SS cigarette smoke are chemically and physically complex mixtures consisting of electrically charged submicron
liquid particles at very high concentration consisting of permanent gases, reactive gases, and a large variety of
organic chemicals. The composition of the smoke and especially the total quantities of individual constituents
delivered are dependent on the conditions of smoke generation [Ex. 4&hyph;311].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nicotine, while found in the particulate phase in MS, is found predominantly in the gas phase in ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;100].
The differences in size distribution for MS and SS particles, as well as the different breathing patterns of smokers
and nonsmokers, affect deposition of the produced particle contaminants in various regions of the respiratory tract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are substantial similarities and some differences between MS and SS emissions from cigarettes [Exs. 3&hyph;689D,
4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;239]. Differences in MS and SS emissions are due to differences in the temperature of the combustion
of tobacco, pH, and degree of dilution with the air, which is accompanied by a correspondingly rapid decrease in temperature.
SS is generated at a lower temperature (approximately 600
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C between puffs versus 800 to 900
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C for MS during puffs) and at a higher pH (6.7&hyph;7.5 versus 6.0&hyph;6.7) than MS. Being slightly more alkaline,
SS contains more ammonia, is depleted of acids, contains greater quantities of organic bases, and contains less hydrogen
cyanide than MS. Differences in MS and SS are also ascribable to differences in the oxygen concentration (16% in MS
versus 2% in SS). SS contaminants are generated in a more reducing environment than those in MS, which will affect the
distribution of some compounds. Nitrosamines, for example, are present in greater concentrations in SS than in MS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the compounds found in MS, which were identified as human carcinogens, are also found in SS emissions [Exs.
3&hyph;689D, 4&hyph;93, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;239, 4&hyph;269] and at emission rates considerably higher than for
MS. SS contains ten times more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aza-arenes and amines as compared with MS [Ex. 4&hyph;126].
All of the five known carcinogens, nine probable human carcinogens, and three animal carcinogens are emitted at higher
levels in SS than in MS, several by an order of magnitude or more. Several toxic compounds found in MS are also found in
SS (carbon monoxide, ammonia, nitrogen oxides, nicotine, acrolein, acetone, etc.), in some cases by an order of magnitude
or higher (Tables III&hyph;6 and III&hyph;7).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SS emissions, quantitatively, show little variability as a function of a number of variables (puff volume, filter
versus nonfilter cigarette, and filter ventilation [Exs. 4&hyph;1, 4&hyph;34, 4&hyph;54, 4&hyph;128, 4&hyph;129,
4&hyph;141]. The lack of substantial variability in SS emissions is related to the fact that they are primarily related
to the weight of tobacco and paper consumed during the smoldering period, with little influence exerted by cigarette
design [Ex. 4&hyph;129].

(b) Human Activity Pattern Studies Used to Assess Workplace Exposure. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Human activity pattern studies utilize random samples of human activity patterns using questionnaires and time-diary
data to provide detailed generalizable data about human behavior. Such studies have been used to assess exposure
to ETS. In 1987&hyph;1988, the California Air Resources Board sponsored a probability-based cross-sectional sample
of 1,579 Californians aged 18 years and older, called the California Activity Pattern Survey (CAPS) [Exs. 4&hyph;168,
4&hyph;271]. The study was designed to provide information on time spent in various locations, including indoors,
outdoors, and in transit, as well as specific microenvironments, such as living rooms, kitchens, automobiles, or
buses. The study focused on time spent in activities such as cooking or playing sports, but more specifically targeted
activities and environments that had implications for air pollution exposure, such as the presence of smokers, use
of cooking equipment or solvents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In analyzing the data from CAPS, Jenkins et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;168] and Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] found that time
spent at work had a high correlation with exposure to ETS. This association of ETS exposure with work settings remained
strong after controlling for the length of the activity episode, and hence was not simply a function of longer time
intervals at work. Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] also found that men reported higher levels of exposure than women,
even after controlling for age, employment status, shorter working hours, etc. This finding suggests that the epidemiological
studies of passive smoking and lung cancer, which have focussed on women, may be underestimating the effect of ETS
on lung cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further analysis of the CAP study [Ex. 4&hyph;169] verifies the high percentage of nonsmokers who are exposed to ETS
while at work. This is indicated when the data are analyzed by employed nonsmoker status. As indicated in Table III&hyph;8,
51% of male and 38% of female nonsmokers reported ETS exposure at work. The average duration of this exposure was 313
minutes for males and 350 minutes for females. When the group that reported exposure at the workplace is analyzed further
it becomes apparent that the overwhelming exposure location for these employed nonsmokers is the workplace (Table
III&hyph;9). As indicated in Table III&hyph;9, 77% of males and 85% of females were exposed an average of 313 minutes
and 350 minutes, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One other finding is that the more time spent at work, the higher the likelihood of greater ETS exposure. For example,
the average duration of exposure to homemakers was approximately 2 hours a day, for workers the average duration of
exposure was approximately 3 hours a day.

Work breaks and meals at work were the work activities most closely associated with ETS exposure, 51% and 35% respectively
versus 27% for work per se [Ex. 4&hyph;271]. In other words, nonsmokers experienced ETS exposure in break areas more
than in general work areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When white collar versus blue collar workplaces were compared, 37% of factories/plants versus 22% of offices had
episodes of ETS exposure, suggesting that blue collar nonsmoking workers have a greater exposure to ETS than white
collar workers. For the CAP population, twice as many workers were employed in offices as were in factories [Ex. 4&hyph;271].
The most ETS exposed nonsmokers were those with 10 or more hours per day of work (especially at plants/factories),
more than 2 hours per day of restaurant time, and more than 1 hour per day of bar or nightclub time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;271] concluded that the probability of passive smoking is highest for a combination of
various social and work activities, consistent with the notion that activities that involve more people involve
a greater chance of contact with people who smoke. A limitation of the CAP survey is that the data do not provide information
on the intensity of exposure in the various microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;271].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the CAP study showed that the most powerful predictor of potential exposure to ETS was being employed.
Respondents who spent more than ten hours a day at the workplace were found to report more ETS exposure than those working
less than 10 hours a day or not at all. Further data from this study show that the workplace is the location with the highest
reported exposure to ETS in enclosed environments, and such exposure is on average nearly three times more prevalent
at work than at home.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another relevant data source for assessing ETS exposure in the workplace is the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In its Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
(NHIS-HPDP) supplement, CDC collected self-reported information on smoking from a representative sample of the
U.S. population [Ex. 4&hyph;51]. The results suggest that at least 19% of employed nonsmokers experience ETS exposure
at work. The CDC study results represent the prevalence of occupational exposure among nonsmoking adults [see section
IV for further discussion of this study].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a smaller study, Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67] studied the prevalence of exposure to ETS in 663 (44% male) never-
and exsmokers aged 18&hyph;84 years, who attended a cancer clinic in Buffalo, New York in 1986 (see Table IV&hyph;9).
The study employed questionnaires and analysis of urinary cotinine levels. The subjects were asked if they were exposed
to passive smoke either at home or at work in the four days preceding the interview. A further analysis of this data focusing
on workers from this survey determined that overall, 339 subjects were currently employed. Of these 264 (77%) reported
ETS exposure at work. The percentage of subjects exposed to ETS at both work and the home was 29% (n=99). The percentage
of subjects exposed at home, but not at work was 7% (n=23). The percentage of subjects exposed at work, but not at home
was 49% (n=165). The percentage of subjects exposed neither at home or work was 15% (n=52). This further analysis indicates
that the workplace is a significant source of ETS exposure for nonsmoking, employed people.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emmons et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;98] reported on a study of 186 nonsmoking volunteers from workplace settings selected to
have a wide range of exposure to ETS. The subjects were asked to keep a 7-day exposure diary. The worksites ranged from
those with minimal restrictions and high levels of exposure (long-term care and psychiatric facilities, chemical
dependency and treatment centers, and a VA Hospital) to those with extensive restrictions and low exposure (e.g.,
state health department and community hospitals). Seventy-six percent of the subjects reported being regularly
exposed to ETS in the workplace. The percentage of subjects reporting exposure at work is similar to that found by Cummings
et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67]. Nonsmokers encountered significantly more exposure to ETS at work (50%) as compared to home
(10%). When the data set was examined by the presence or absence of smokers in the home, however, subjects who lived
with smokers had virtually equivalent exposures across all three settings: work (34%), home (36%), and ``other''
(31%). Nonsmokers living with smokers received 29 minutes per day of exposure at work and 31 minutes per day at home
and 27 minutes per day in other settings. On the other hand, subjects who did not live with smokers had the majority of
their exposure at work (36 minutes per day) and very little at other settings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional studies verify that the workplace is an important source of exposure to ETS, particularly for nonsmokers
unexposed at home [Exs. 4&hyph;172, 4&hyph;262, 4&hyph;315]. A U.K. study of exposure to ETS in 20 nonsmoking men
whose wives smoked showed that 78% of the men's reported hours of exposure came from outside the home; by contrast,
90% of the ETS exposure of 101 nonsmoking men whose wives did not smoke was reported to come from non-domestic microenvironments
[Ex. 4&hyph;315]. Repace and Lowrey [Ex. 4&hyph;262] estimated that 86% of the U.S. population was exposed to ETS,
and that the workplace was more important than the home as a source of ETS exposure, when weighted by the duration, exposure
intensity, and probability of exposure. Kabat and Wynder [Ex. 4&hyph;172], in a study of 215 sixty-year-old U.S.
women nonsmokers, found that 65% reported exposure to ETS at home and 67% reported exposure at work, averaged over
adulthood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusion that can be made from the activity surveys is that the workplace is a major location of ETS-exposure
to nonsmokers. Human activities that involve contact with a greater number of people increase the probability of
contact with smokers, and thus with ETS. These studies indicate that the workplace, with its high person densities
relative to other microenvironments, including the home, appears to be a major factor in the working nonsmoking population's
ETS exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Personal monitoring studies have confirmed the role of the workplace as an important microenvironment of ETS exposure
to nonsmokers. Spengler et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;288] and Sexton et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;280] demonstrated by personal monitoring
of respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and the use of time-activity questionnaires that exposures to ETS both
at home and at work are significant contributors to personal RSP exposures. Coultas et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;66], in a pilot
study of 15 nonsmokers in Albuquerque, New Mexico, collected questionnaires and samples of saliva and urine to determine
workplace ETS exposure. Personal air samples were obtained pre- and post-workshift. Exposure to ETS was reported
by 13 of the 15 subjects. The mean number of hours of exposure was 3.4 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2.1). Basically, although the levels of cotinine, respirable particles, and nicotine varied with self-reports
of ETS exposure, the general trend was a direct relationship between increasing incidence of self-reporting of exposure
and actual biomarker data. Coghlin, Hammond, and Gann [Ex. 4&hyph;61] found similar results for 53 nonsmoking volunteers
studied by use of personal nicotine monitors, diaries, and questionnaires. They also found that the closer a nonsmoker
was to a smoker, the higher the probability that the nonsmoker would report exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presently, vapor phase nicotine and respirable suspended particulate matter (ETS&hyph;RSP) are the most commonly
used markers for ETS because of their ease of measurement, knowledge of their emission rate from tobacco combustion,
and their relationship to other ETS contaminants [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Controlled experiments have shown that vapor
phase nicotine varies with the source strength, and shows little variation among brands of cigarettes. Field studies
have also shown that vapor phase nicotine concentrations are correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked, and
further that weekly average nicotine concentrations are correlated with ETS-RSP [Ex. 4&hyph;311].

(d) Levels of Respirable Suspended Particulates and Nicotine Found in Field Studies. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respirable suspended particulates (RSP) and nicotine are the most commonly used surrogates for ETS exposure [Ex.
4&hyph;239]. Both chamber and field studies have demonstrated that tobacco combustion has a major impact on indoor
RSP mass when particle size is under 2.5 microns [Ex. 4&hyph;239]. A few examples illustrating the impact of ETS on
nicotine and RSP concentrations in workplace and domestic microenvironments are shown in Tables III&hyph;10 and
III&hyph;11. Studies of RSP in public access buildings by Leaderer et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;190], First [Ex. 4&hyph;105],
and Repace and Lowrey [Exs. 4&hyph;260, 4&hyph;261] (a total of 42 smoking buildings and 21 nonsmoking buildings)
showed that the weighted average RSP level during smoking in the smoking buildings was 262 &mu;g/m3, while in the nonsmoking
buildings the RSP level average 36 &mu;g/m3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leaderer and Hammond [Ex. 4&hyph;189] measured weekly average vapor phase nicotine and RSP concentrations in 96
residences. Vapor phase nicotine measurements were found to be closely related to number of cigarettes smoked and
highly predictive of RSP generated by tobacco combustion. The mean RSP background in the absence of measurable nicotine
was found to be 15.2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7 &mu;g/m3. The mean RSP value in the presence of nicotine was 44.1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30 &mu;g/m3. The weekly mean nicotine concentration in the 47 residences with detectable nicotine values was 2.17
&mu;g/m3 (Table III&hyph;10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary statistics of additional studies on personal monitoring for nicotine are shown in Table III&hyph;11 [Ex.
4&hyph;263]. These studies show that the median exposures ranged from 5 to 20 &mu;g/m3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summary nicotine data analyzed by the U.S. EPA [Ex. 4&hyph;311] suggest that average nicotine values in residences
where smoking is occurring will average 2 to approximately 10 &mu;g/m3, with peak values of 0.1 to 14 &mu;g/m3 as shown
in Table III&hyph;10. Offices with smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to
that of residences, but with considerably higher peak values. RSP mass concentrations in smoker-occupied residences
show average increases of from 18 to 95 &mu;g/m3, with individual increases as high as 560 &mu;g/m3 or as low as 5 &mu;g/m3.
ETS&hyph;RSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on average appear to be about the same as in residences.
Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of increases
in particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential or office environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, field data show that RSP is elevated by one to two orders of magnitude during smoking, and that nicotine
released during smoking is easily detectable in both homes and workplaces by area or personal monitors. Offices with
smoking occupants show a range of average nicotine concentrations similar to that of residences (2 to 10 &mu;g/m3),
but with considerably higher maximum values. ETS&hyph;RSP concentrations in offices with smoking occupants on
average appear to be about the same as residences (18 to 95 &mu;g/m3). Restaurants, transportation, and other indoor
spaces with smoking occupants have a generally wider range of particle mass concentrations due to ETS than residential
or office environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. It must be noted that measurements of nicotine and ETS&hyph;RSP in indoor
spaces do not constitute a direct measure of total exposure. Concentrations measured in all microenvironments have
to be combined with human activity pattern studies to determine the time-weighted sum of various exposures.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nicotine, and its metabolite, cotinine, and other tobacco smoke constituents in the saliva, blood and urine have
been used as biomarkers of active and passive smoking. Nicotine and cotinine can be used to determine the integrated
short-term exposure of ETS across all microenvironments [Ex. 4&hyph;311].

Both nicotine and cotinine are tobacco-specific. Cotinine in saliva, blood, and urine is the most widely accepted
biomarker for integrated exposure to both active smoking and ETS by virtue of its longer half-life than nicotine in
body fluids. The half-life of cotinine in nonsmokers is of the order of a day, making it a good indicator of integrated
ETS exposure over the previous day or two [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Although intersubject variability exists for both nicotine
absorption and cotinine metabolism [Exs. 4&hyph;156, 4&hyph;162], cotinine is a good indicator that ETS exposure
has taken place [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Further, studies show that cotinine levels correlate with levels of recent ETS
exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, nonsmokers' exposure to ETS has been characterized by a database of widely used atmospheric and biological
markers which have been measured in a number of workplaces, such as offices, restaurants, commercial buildings,
and on trains and in planes. OSHA believes that this database is sufficient to support the risk assessment which follows.
ETS-nicotine exposures of the average worker appear to be of the order of 5 to 10 micrograms per cubic meter (&mu;g/m3),
and for the most-exposed workers, 50 to 100 &mu;g/m3). For ETS-RSP, exposures are about tenfold that of the nicotine
levels. The concentrations of various ETS atmospheric markers to which nonsmokers are exposed in the workplace,
such as nicotine, respirable suspended particulate matter (RSP) and carbon monoxide, are linearly correlated with
the amount of tobacco burned. Studies of human activity patterns show that the workplace is the largest single contributor
to ETS exposure. Air exchange rates in nonindustrial workplaces are not designed to control the risks of ETS exposure.

(f) Inadequacy of General Dilution Ventilation to Address Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure Control.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A primary function of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is to circulate air throughout
a building to achieve thermal and sensory comfort for the building occupants. The general ventilation function of
the HVAC system is to dilute and remove occupant generated bioeffluents and other contaminants from the space. However,
from the industrial hygiene perspective, general ventilation as delivered by a HVAC system, is not an acceptable
engineering control measure for controlling occupational exposures to ETS.

Dilution ventilation offers no protection in those cases where, due to the close proximity to a smoker (e.g., contaminant
point source), the nonsmoking employee may be exposed to large amounts of sidestream smoke and exhaled mainstream
smoke (ETS). Due to the limitations of general ventilation, the smoke cannot be removed from the air before reaching
the breathing zone of nearby employees. The carcinogenicity of ETS discounts the use of general ventilation as an
engineering control for this contaminant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major ventilation guidance document available to HVAC practioners (e.g., designers, maintenance, and operators),
is Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'' [Ex. 4&hyph;333]. The standard
is published by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) and
it specifies recommended minimum design outside air ventilation rates for 91 different applications. Based on this
current ventilation standard, a typical commercial HVAC system serving general office space should prescriptively
deliver 20 cubic feet per minute per person (cfm/person) of outside air to the occupied space to dilute occupant generated
contaminants like carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and body odors. This ventilation rate would provide what ASHRAE defines as ``acceptable indoor air quality'' (e.g.,
sensory comfort) to satisfy at least 80% of the building occupants. The prescribed ventilation rates in ASHRAE Standard
62&hyph;1989 are proportional to the occupants in the space (e.g., cfm/PER PERSON) because of the presumption that
the contamination produced is in proportion to the occupant density. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The foreword of ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 states ``with respect to tobacco smoke and other contaminants, this
standard does not, and cannot, ensure the avoidance of all possible adverse health effects, but it reflects recognized
consensus criteria and guidance.'' As published, ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 did not include any summary and/or
explanation documentation which would explain the basis of the consensus standard. Without this documentation,
it can only be inferred that the standard was mostly based on satisfaction of sensory comfort rather than based on the
control of contaminants like ETS which may contribute to adverse health effects like lung cancer and heart disease.

The method of room air distribution found in most HVAC systems is a mixing system that attempts to create an environment
of uniform air velocities, temperatures and humidities in the occupied zone of a room (e.g.; floor to 6 feet above floor).
In this occupied zone, air velocities less than 50 feet per minute (fpm) and minimization of temperature gradients
will promote occupant comfort. In a conventional mixing system where the supply air diffusers (outlets) and the return
air grilles are both located in the ceiling, the air motion in the occupied zone could be characterized as ``gentle
drift'' toward the ceiling where the room air is then mixed with the conditioned air being delivered to the room through
the supply air diffusers [1993 ASHRAE Handbook, Ch.31]. Because of natural convection currents and thermal buoyancy
forces it is common, especially during heating season, to have stagnant zones. In a mixing room air distribution system,
the emphasis is on comfort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other room air distribution schemes which consider contaminant control and have been used in the industrial
environment like displacement ventilation and unidirectional (plug-flow) airflow ventilation. In these schemes,
there is an attempt to move contaminants directionally along a clean to less clean gradient. These schemes are seldom
used in conventional HVAC systems due to their cost, feasibility and compromise of comfort issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From the industrial hygiene perspective, local exhaust ventilation, specific to each source, would be the preferred
and recommended method for controlling occupational exposures to contaminant point sources like ETS. Such specific
ventilation is effective because the contaminant is captured or contained at its source before it is dispersed into
the work environment where only ineffective general dilution ventilation is available to control exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A designated smoking area which is enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside, and maintained under negative pressure
is sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Such areas could be considered an application
of local exhaust ventilation because the contaminant is being exhausted from a confined source without dispersal
into the general workspace.

IV. Preliminary Quantitative Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determining factor in the decision to perform a quantitative risk assessment is the availability of suitable
data for use in such an assessment. A wide spectrum of health effects have been associated with exposure to indoor air
pollutants and ETS. These effects range from acute irritant effects to cancer. In the case of ETS, OSHA has determined
that data are available to quantify two types of risk: lung cancer and heart disease. For this risk assessment, OSHA
defines ``heart disease'' to be coronary heart disease excluding strokes, as defined in the Framingham study [Ex.
4&hyph;108]. In the case of indoor air pollutants, the only data available to OSHA were on specific acute health effects,
such as severe headaches, excluding migraines, and other respiratory conditions, such as ``stuffy nose'', ``runny
nose'', etc. OSHA is aware that there are more serious conditions such as legionellosis and hypersensitivity diseases
associated with poor indoor air and suspected to be potential occupational hazards. However, the Agency currently
does not have adequate data to conduct a quantitative risk assessment addressing these risks in the workplace. OSHA
is continuing to develop appropriate methodology to address risk estimations for conditions related to poor indoor
air quality in the workplace and is requesting input on data sources relevant to these efforts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is uncertainty associated with the quantification of any kind of risk. In this risk assessment, OSHA has tried
to describe many of the sources of uncertainty and to address their implications for OSHA's estimates of risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this rulemaking and for deriving a quantitative estimate of occupational risk, OSHA has concentrated
on information and data concerning heart disease and lung cancer as potential effects associated with exposure to
ETS.

B. Review of Epidemiologic Studies and Published Risk Estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a first step in this risk assessment, OSHA critically reviewed epidemiologic studies associating exposure to
ETS or indoor air pollutants with adverse health effects. The purpose of such a critical evaluation was to determine
whether exposure to ETS is a causal factor in cancer and heart disease and whether exposure to indoor air pollutants
has caused a significant increase in acute irritant effects. The critical review also enables OSHA to select those
studies that have potential for use in a quantitative risk assessment. Tables IV&hyph;1 and IV&hyph;2 contain a summary
of OSHA's assessment of several epidemiologic studies of ETS exposed individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA evaluated studies on exposure to ETS to determine the importance and weight of each study in the overall hazard
identification process. Of those, it was determined that fourteen showed a statistically strong association between
exposure to ETS and lung cancer and four showed a significant association between ETS exposure and heart disease.
Studies that were determined to be ``positive'' by OSHA's review standards met standard epidemiologic and statistical
criteria to support causation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Overall, on the basis of the studies reviewed, OSHA concludes that the relative risk of lung cancer in nonsmokers due
to chronic exposure to ETS ranges between 1.20 and 1.50 and the relative risk for heart disease due to ETS exposure ranges
between 1.24 and 3.00.

Most published risk assessments are based on spousal exposure to ETS. These studies have examined the lung cancer
risk in nonsmoking housewives, using spousal smoking as a surrogate for the wife's exposure to ETS. The size of the
association between these health effects and ETS exposure in the workplace is expected to be at least as large as the
association seen between these health effects and ETS exposure in residential settings or public places. As noted
by Meridian Research in their 1988 report, ``.&blank;.&blank;. it is the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke,
and not the environment in which that exposure occurs, that is the important risk factor'' [Ex. 4&hyph;221]. Therefore,
health effects observed and the risk estimates calculated from studies of the general population, or of selected
subgroups, such as nonsmoking wives of smoking husbands, are relevant to the working nonsmoking population.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In developing risk estimates for disease attributable to occupational exposure, reliance is placed on exposure
encountered in the workplace to the extent possible. However, in the absence of purely occupational data, information
derived in environments other than work sites is also considered. OSHA believes that there is no physiological difference
related to exposure (or its outcome) regardless of where it is experienced. This is true regardless of whether the
endpoint is lung cancer, heart disease, or indoor air related acute irritant effects. The only difference is that
the degree of exposure may be greater in one place than in the other. Available information which uses nicotine concentration
as an index of exposure suggests that the differences in exposure between office workplaces and residences lie well
within the uncertainties of the determinations and for some workplaces, such as restaurants and transportation
facilities, exposures are significantly higher than the average exposures found in residences. Thus, risk estimates
based on residential exposures are expected to accurately reflect occupational risks in most workplaces and possibly
underestimate the risk in some workplaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing its risk assessment for lung cancer, the EPA reviewed 19 studies which investigated nicotine concentrations
in various environments [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. EPA's analysis showed that the range of average nicotine concentrations
in office workplaces is very similar to that of homes. However, in some workplaces, such as restaurants and transportation
facilities, exposures are significantly higher. It is true that there are many complicating factors in such determinations
which could affect any final conclusions. For example, it is important to consider the duration of exposure, the intensity
of exposure, the distance from the sources and other factors as well. However, EPA's analysis suggests that risk assessments
based on home exposures are relevant to workplaces as well and, in comparison to some workplaces, may even result in
an underestimate of the true occupational risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, other studies substantiate the magnitude of workplace exposures. For example, Emmons et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;98]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that the majority of ETS exposure occurred in the workplace. Study subjects were selected from workplace settings
with a wide range of ETS exposure. The work sites ranged from those with minimal restriction of smoking and high levels
of exposure to work sites with extensive smoking restrictions and low exposure. Ninety percent of the subjects worked
outside the home. Eighty-four percent of those who worked outside the home (75.6% of the total sample) reported being
regularly exposed to smoking in the workplace. While the most highly exposed individuals in the study were those who
had both home and work exposures, it is clear that workplace exposure constituted a significant component of overall
exposure. Subjects who did not live with smokers reported that the majority of their exposure was in the workplace
(mean=36.1 min/day), home (mean=1.4 min/day) or in other locations (mean=13.1 min/day). Subjects who lived with
smokers reported receiving slightly more exposure at home than the workplace, however the difference between home
exposure and workplace exposure was not substantial (work: mean=29.4 min/day, home: mean=31.2 min/day, other:
mean=27.1 min/day). These results are shown in Table IV&hyph;5. The importance of the findings from this study is
twofold. First, it indicates that the workplace is the primary source of ETS exposure for nonsmokers, who do not live
with smokers. Secondly, it shows that for nonsmokers living with smokers, even though their household environment
becomes their primary source of exposure, the workplace still contributes a substantial amount of exposure, comparable
to that experienced by the nonsmoker living with nonsmokers (29.4 min/day v. 36.1 min/day).

As mentioned previously, only diseases that have been reported to be significantly associated with ETS exposure
and for which OSHA has access to data will be used in calculating health risk due to occupational exposure to ETS. These
will be referred to as the ``diseases of interest'' and include coronary heart disease (excluding strokes) as defined
in the Framingham study and lung cancer.

Ideally, data on the incidence of the diseases of interest in the U.S. population were needed to estimate the number
of cases of disease in employed nonsmokers. Since nationwide incidence data were not available for nonsmokers, several
survey sources were used to estimate the mortality rates for heart disease (Framingham Community Study) [Ex. 4&hyph;108],
and lung cancer (Cancer Prevention Survey conducted by the American Cancer Society) [Ex. 4&hyph;7]. Data on the U.S.
workforce were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [Ex. 4&hyph;39]. Based on the 1993 annual averages, as
estimated by the Household Survey, BLS reports that the U.S. workforce for sectors covered by this standard is estimated
to be 101,631,300 (men: 54.36%, women: 45.64%). Information on the proportion of employed adults who smoke was obtained
from the National Health Interview Survey and is found in Table IV&hyph;7 [Ex. 4&hyph;235]. It is estimated that 74,201,000
adults (73.01% of the U.S. labor force), employed in sectors covered by this standard, are nonsmokers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to characterize prevalence of occupational exposure, OSHA considered several sources. To determine
the prevalence of smoking among U.S. adults during 1991, the National Health Interview Survey-Health Promotion
and Disease Prevention (NHIS&hyph;HPDP) supplement collected self-reported information on smoking exposure
at work from a representative sample of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population greater than 18 years
of age [Ex. 4&hyph;51]. In particular, employed individuals were asked whether, during the past two weeks, anyone
had smoked in their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to reflect national
estimates, 18.81 percent of nonsmokers reported exposure to smoke in their immediate work area as shown in Table IV&hyph;8.
OSHA believes that 18.81 percent may be an underestimate of frequency of exposure in the workplace because it is based
solely on self-reported information and the question was not very specific in defining immediate work area.

Another source considered by OSHA for defining nonsmoker ETS exposure in the workplace was the work published by Cummings
et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;67]. A recent re-analysis of the data file showed that among the nonsmoking, currently employed
subjects, 48.67 percent (165 out of 339) reported exposure to ETS at work and not at home (Table IV&hyph;9) [Ex. 4&hyph;69].
Based on the data sources mentioned above, OSHA assumes that the percent of nonsmoking workers who are potentially
exposed to ETS at their worksite ranges between 18.81 and 48.67.

. The U.S. population incidence rate of lung cancer for nonsmoking women is reported to be 0.121 per one thousand nonsmoking
women. The lung cancer incidence for nonsmoking males is estimated to be higher. For the purpose of this risk assessment,
OSHA used 0.121 as the population incidence rate of lung cancer for nonsmokers. This will most likely result in an underestimate
of the true risk for male workers. The average annual incidence rate for death from coronary heart disease excluding
strokes for nonsmokers age 35 to 64 is estimated to be 4 per one thousand men and 2 per one thousand women, as reported
by the Framingham study. This results in an overall weighted average of 3 deaths per one thousand individuals.

OSHA used 1.34 as an observed estimate of relative risk (RR) for lung cancer among nonsmokers with occupational exposure
as reported by Fontham et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;106]. Estimates of observed relative risk for heart disease in nonsmokers,
as reported by Helsing et al. (1.24 for females and 1.31 for males), were used in calculating an overall adjusted relative
risk estimate of 1.28 [Ex. 4&hyph;139]. The adjusted relative risk was a weighted average of the reported relative
risks using the gender composition of the U.S. workforce as weights ((1.24*45.64 + 1.31*54.36/100) = 1.28). The proportion
of nonsmoking workers exposed to ETS while at work (p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was assumed to range from 18.81 to 48.67 as stated previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA chose to rely on the Fontham and Helsing studies for estimates of the observed relative risks for several reasons.
Both studies were conducted in the U.S. Both are large, population-based studies whose results can be generalized
to the general public. Both studies, by design, controlled for misclassification to a large degree. The Helsing study,
which was done in the 60's_a time when smoking was more acceptable than more recently, and being a prospective cohort
study, was less prone to misclassification and other sources of bias. The Fontham study used multiple sources to ascertain
nonsmoking status and validate subject response. Study subjects were questioned twice; the self-reported nonsmoking
status was corroborated by urinary cotinine measurements; and medical records were cross-referenced with the physician's
assessment. In addition, in the Fontham study, information on occupational exposure was collected and an estimate
of lung cancer risk attributable to the workplace exposure was ascertained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The annual risk of disease attributable to occupational exposure to ETS was estimated by dividing the expected number
of cases (N
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by the number of nonsmoking workers in the U.S. population. Table IV&hyph;10 presents the annual risk attributable
to occupational exposure to ETS per 1,000 exposed employees. Because section (6)(b)(5) of the OSH Act states that
no employee shall suffer ``material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such an employee has regular
exposure to the hazard dealt with *&blank;*&blank;* for the period of his working life'', OSHA has converted the attributable
annual risk into an attributable lifetime risk on the assumption that a worker is employed in his or her occupation
for 45 years. Lifetime estimates of risk attributable to occupational ETS are presented in Table IV&hyph;10. Information
contained in Table IV&hyph;10 indicates that for every 1,000 workers exposed to ETS, approximately 1 will most likely
develop lung cancer and 7 to 16 will develop heart disease if they are exposed to ETS at their workplace in the course
of a 45-year working lifetime. The formula used to calculate lifetime risk estimates the probability of at least one
occurrence of disease in 45 years of continuous exposure and assumes independence of events from year to year. It also
assumes that the worker's exposure profile and working conditions that may affect the level and intensity of exposure
remain constant throughout a working lifetime.

E. OSHA's Risk Estimates_Indoor Air Quality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Adverse health effects associated with poor IAQ are described as Building-Related Illness (BRI) and Sick Building
Syndrome (SBS). SBS related conditions are not easily traced to a single specific substance, but are perceived as
resulting from some unidentified contaminant or combination of contaminants. Symptoms are relieved when the employee
leaves the building and may be reduced by modifying the ventilation system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research in Britain [Ex. 4&hyph;44], Denmark [Ex. 4&hyph;284] and the United States [Ex. 3&hyph;745] indicates
that about 20% of all office workers are afflicted with such symptoms. If the 20% level were to be considered as ``background'',
a simple approach would be to determine that any building, more than 20% of whose occupants report the symptoms, would
be considered to be ``sick''. However, the question then arises as to how much greater than 20% would the incidence
have to be to be considered excess and how would one address such issues as statistical significance for any one building.
Furthermore, the definition used in assessing symptom occurrence can cause substantial variations in estimating
symptom prevalence, even in the same building. The problem with many investigations of ``sick'' buildings is that
rarely have ``non-sick'' or control buildings been used to determine background prevalence of the symptoms. Until
now, it appears that limited research has been done to address the issue of background levels of symptoms. OSHA seeks
input on data sources to address expected background levels of SBS related conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mendell and Smith [Ex. 4&hyph;218] examined symptom reports compiled in a number of individual studies for a number
of buildings which had different types of ventilation. On the basis of the information gathered in the individual
studies, Mendell and Smith compared the prevalence of sick building symptoms in buildings with five types of ventilation:
natural only; fans only; air conditioned with no humidification; air conditioned with steam humidification; and
air conditioned with water-based humidification. Overall, they found the prevalence of work-related headache,
lethargy, upper respiratory/mucous membrane, lower respiratory and skin symptoms significantly increased in
buildings with any type of air conditioning as compared to buildings with no air conditioning. Thus, according to
this analysis, a basic problem with SBS appears to reside in the air conditioning system or, in some building aspect
associated with the presence of air-conditioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building-related illness (BRI) describes those specific medical conditions of known etiology which can often be
documented by physical signs and laboratory findings. Symptoms may or may not disappear when the employee leaves
the building. Currently, OSHA does not have any data on BRI related symptoms to conduct a quantitative risk assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of cases of illness in the United States related to poor indoor air quality has not yet been quantified; however
OSHA has made an attempt to develop a preliminary risk estimate of SBS using a similar methodology as was done for ETS.
The National Health Interview Survey was the primary data source for U.S. population frequency rates for acute upper
respiratory symptoms other than the common cold, influenza, acute bronchitis, and pneumonia and frequency rates
on severe headaches other than migraines. For this preliminary risk assessment, OSHA used the reported frequency
rates as representative of population incidence rates for upper respiratory conditions and severe headaches. OSHA
seeks comment on the use of frequency data in place of incidence data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Observed relative risks for comparable conditions were estimated by Mendell [Ex. 4&hyph;219]. Mendell's data source
was the California Healthy Building Study. This study surveyed a representative sample of 12 public office buildings
in Northern California to ascertain the occurrence of work-related symptoms associated with air-conditioned office
buildings. All buildings were either smokefree or had separately ventilated designated smoking areas. The sample
included 6 buildings with air- conditioning systems, 3 buildings with mechanical ventilation and no air-conditioning,
and 3 buildings with natural ventilation. The study included 880 workers. Mendell estimated relative risks for several
building related symptoms and a subset of these estimates are shown in Table IV&hyph;11. In an effort to define comparable
symptoms between the reported national statistics from NHIS and Mendell's study and for computational ease OSHA
grouped ``runny nose'', ``stuffy nose'', ``dry/irritated throat'', and ``dry/irritated/itching eyes'' as upper
respiratory/mucous membrane symptoms. Mendell reported relative risks for upper respiratory conditions and frequent
headaches in air-conditioned buildings as compared to naturally ventilated buildings. The relative risk for frequent
headaches was reported to be 1.5. For upper respiratory conditions, such as ``stuffy nose'', ``runny nose'', etc.,
the relative risks ranged from 1.4 to 1.8. OSHA used 1.4 as an observed relative risk for upper respiratory conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDC reports in the ``Current Estimates from the National Health Interview Survey, 1992'' that the annual rate for
severe headaches, requiring medical attention or activity restriction, is at least 5 per thousand and the rate for
upper respiratory conditions is at least 9 per thousand. In addition, it is estimated that the proportion of office
buildings in the U.S. with air-conditioning is 70 percent (see Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis section).
Using the above information and the same methodology as described in section IV-D, OSHA estimated that the lifetime
excess burden for severe headaches experienced in air-conditioned office buildings is 57 per one thousand exposed
employees and the lifetime risk for acute upper respiratory conditions is 85 per one thousand exposed employees.
OSHA's risk estimates for indoor air are shown in Table IV&hyph;12. OSHA used data derived from a study of air-conditioned
office buildings to make an assessment of the occupational risk in all air-conditioned buildings. Furthermore,
OSHA made an implicit assumption that an increase in work-related headaches associated with an air-conditioned
office environment occurs in the same proportion as headaches which can be severe enough to affect work activity.
OSHA seeks comment on the applicability of the Mendell study for estimating occupational risk in air-conditioned
buildings due to poor indoor air quality. In addition, OSHA seeks comment on its methodology of developing annual
and lifetime risk estimates attributable to occupational exposures.

F. Pharmacokinetic Modeling of ETS Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In developing a final rule, OSHA would like to consider the use of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
model in an effort to develop a clear and complete picture of factors that may affect environmental exposure measurements,
internal dose estimates and ultimately estimates of expected risk attributed to ETS exposure at the workplace. OSHA
is seeking comment on appropriate methodology, available data, etc. The following discussion offers an explanation
of OSHA's approach to this issue and an opportunity for the Agency to solicit comment on specific points of concern
as they relate to the use of pharmacokinetics in estimating occupational risk from exposure to ETS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estimating the risk from exposure to ETS requires the use of some measure of the extent of exposure. Possible measures,
or metrics, can range from categorical ranking based on survey responses to direct measurement of ETS-related chemicals
in the body fluids of exposed individuals. In general, the use of an internal measure of individual exposure would
be preferred over measurements of environmental contamination, such as airborne chemical or particulate concentrations.
In particular, considerable attention has been given in the scientific literature to the possible use of cotinine
concentrations in body fluids as a biomarker of ETS exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;146, 4&hyph;165, 4&hyph;263,
4&hyph;316]. However, obtaining a dependable estimate of exposure from measurements of a chemical's concentration
in body fluids requires a quantitative understanding of the chemical's pharmacokinetics; its uptake, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion. Following is a review of the evidence concerning the suitability of cotinine as an internal
biomarker for ETS exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Considerations for Selection of a Biomarker for ETS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A biomarker should, to the greatest extent possible, accurately represent the individual's exposure to the substance
of concern and have relevance to a specific endpoint. In the case of ETS, there are several relevant endpoints, with
principal attention being given to heart disease and lung cancer. Each different endpoint may be mediated by a different
subset of the components of ETS, and therefore the appropriate biomarker(s) for each endpoint could be different.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Cardiovascular Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cardiovascular effects resulting from exposure to ETS have been associated with carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine,
and more recently with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [Ex. 4&hyph;123]. Each of these is associated with
a different fraction of ETS; CO is a gas phase constituent, nicotine is a low volatility vapor, and PAHs are absorbed
on particulates. Because of the significant differences in physical fate and transport, a strategy for the use of
biomarkers for cardiovascular effects of ETS would ideally make use of separate markers for CO, nicotine, and PAHs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The most common internal measure of CO exposure is blood carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO). Blood HbCO provides a useful measure
of exposure to CO, and can be related to the cardiovascular effects of CO. A way to determine the occupational component
of one's total CO exposure is to measure workplace CO levels and predict blood HbCO with a physiologically based pharmacokinetic
model for CO [Ex. 4&hyph;11]. A difficulty associated with the use of CO or HbCO as a biomarker for ETS effects is the
presence of other sources of CO in the workplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nicotine can be measured directly in body fluids and the circulating concentration can be related to physiological
effects, such as heart rate [Ex. 4&hyph;26]. Alternatively, measurements of nicotine in air or cotinine in body fluids
can be measured, and the circulating concentration of nicotine can be inferred using a pharmacokinetic model. The
use of a pharmacokinetic model to relate inhaled nicotine to circulating nicotine and cotinine levels is the main
focus of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PAHs are inhaled in the form of particulates on which they are adsorbed. Developing an appropriate biomarker for ETS-associated
PAHs is complicated by the presence of PAHs on particulates not associated with ETS, and by the low, and variable, composition
of PAHs adsorbed to particulate matter. One candidate material which has been suggested as an environmental marker
for ETS-associated particulates is solanesol, a non-volatile tobacco constituent. However, the pharmacokinetic
information necessary for use of solanesol as an internal biomarker is not currently available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of these three different biomarkers (CO, PAHs, and solanesol) does not appear to be practical. It appears that
the most effective strategy currently achievable would be to rely on nicotine (or cotinine) measurement as a specific
marker of ETS exposure as well as a direct measure of nicotine exposure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Carcinogenicity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mechanism of carcinogenicity from exposure to ETS is not known, but it has been established that ETS includes a
number of chemicals which have been identified as carcinogens (see Tables II&hyph;2, III&hyph;6, and III&hyph;7),
although most of the identified carcinogenic components of ETS are not unique to ETS. Therefore, direct measurement
of the carcinogenic components or related biomarkers in biological fluids would not provide a unique measure of exposure
from ETS. The potentially carcinogenic components of ETS include highly volatile chemicals such as formaldehyde
and benzene, lower volatility chemicals such as the nitrosamines, and non-volatile chemicals such as PAHs and metal
compounds, which are bound to particulates. Given the current lack of information on the mechanism of carcinogenicity
of ETS it is impossible to identify which components of ETS should be targeted for exposure estimation. The most prudent
choice for a biomarker in this case would be one which provides the most general representation of all the components
of ETS, and which is itself unique to ETS. In an experimental study of potential ETS-unique environmental markers
of exposure, only nicotine was found to represent both the gas phase and particulate phase organic constituent of
ETS [Ex. 4&hyph;97]. Several studies have shown a strong correlation between measurements of nicotine in the air
and the mutagenicity of ETS [Exs. 4&hyph;198, 4&hyph;215]. In these studies, the relationship of nicotine to mutagenicity
was as good as or better than the relationship of RSP to mutagenicity (RSP is assumed to be the major contributor of the
carcinogenic effects of ETS). Therefore, since measurements of nicotine in the air correlate better than measurements
of RSP to mutagenicity of ETS, and there is a positive correlation between short-term mutagenicity tests and carcinogenicity,
the use of nicotine as an exposure marker for the carcinogenic effects of ETS appears to be justified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Evaluation of Cotinine as a Biomarker for ETS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section is to discuss the use of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, as an internal biomarker for
inhalation exposure to nicotine, and, as such, its usefulness as a metric for the health effects of ETS. Cotinine is
preferred over nicotine as an internal biomarker because of its slower clearance from the body [Ex. 4&hyph;71].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a strong correlation between nicotine intake and plasma cotinine levels [Ex. 4&hyph;115]. There is also
a strong correlation between cotinine measured in body fluids and ETS exposure. In a controlled study, urinary cotinine
was found to be a reliable marker for long-term ETS exposure, and plasma and salivary cotinine were found to be good
indicators of short- as well as long-term exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;73]. Several studies have also demonstrated a positive
relationship between self-reported exposure to ETS and cotinine in serum [Exs. 4&hyph;166, 4&hyph;250, 4&hyph;301],
saliva [Ex. 4&hyph;166], and urine [Exs. 4&hyph;166, 4&hyph;211, 4&hyph;316]. In general, the currently available
data support the assumption that nicotine and cotinine kinetics parameters for smokers can be extrapolated to nonsmokers
for estimating exposures to ETS in nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;24]. Studies have also demonstrated that salivary levels
of cotinine are directly proportional to plasma levels [Ex. 4&hyph;73], and that urinary excretion of cotinine is
linearly related to plasma levels [Ex. 4&hyph;82]. Thus all three biological fluids provide a reasonable metric
for nicotine intake, and thus can serve as biomarkers of ETS exposure in nonsmokers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two potential difficulties associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker for ETS. The first is the presence
of nicotine in the diet. Several foods, including tea, tomatoes, and potatoes, have been shown to contain nicotine
in measurable quantities [Exs. 4&hyph;49, 4&hyph;81, 4&hyph;281]. However, a study of 3,383 nonsmokers was unable
to substantiate an effect of tea drinking on serum cotinine levels for self-reported daily tea consumption [Ex. 4&hyph;301].
The same study did find a strong correlation between self-reported ETS exposure and serum cotinine level.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA seeks comment and data on whether dietary intake of nicotine should be considered a significant factor in modelling
nicotine metabolism for assessing risk due to ETS exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second issue associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker is the possibility that there is a longer half-life
for the elimination of cotinine at very low biological concentrations, associated with the slow release of nicotine
from binding sites [Exs. 4&hyph;28, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;167, 4&hyph;254]. This longer half-life at very low concentrations
could have the effect of overestimating exposure to ETS in the lowest exposed population. At this time there is not
sufficient evidence to quantify the potential magnitude of this effect, but it is likely to be small. OSHA seeks comment
on this issue.

5. Description of Pharmacokinetic Models for Nicotine and Cotinine
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For many purposes, an essentially first order process such as the kinetics of cotinine can be effectively modeled
with a simple compartmental kinetic analysis [Exs. 4&hyph;27, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82]. The compartmental
approach has been used to relate steady-state urinary cotinine levels to atmospheric nicotine concentrations [Ex.
4&hyph;263]. For investigating some of the concerns associated with the use of cotinine as a biomarker, however,
a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) description would be preferred. The advantage of the PBPK approach
stems from its biologically motivated structure, which permits the direct incorporation of biochemical data and
the biologically constrained comparison of model predictions with experimental timecourses to investigate such
issues as dose-rate effects, exposure-route differences, pharmacodynamic processes, and other potential nonlinearities
[Ex. 4&hyph;57]. PBPK models of nicotine and cotinine have been described for both rats [Exs. 4&hyph;112, 4&hyph;255]
and humans [Exs. 4&hyph;254, 4&hyph;270].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A physiological model of cotinine disposition [Ex. 4&hyph;112] was developed to analyze intravenous infusion of
nicotine and cotinine and bolus dosing of cotinine in rats. In general, the observed cotinine time profiles in blood
and tissues were consistent with linear kinetics, but the distribution of cotinine into all tissues appeared to be
roughly three-fold greater following infusion of nicotine than following infusion of cotinine, and the clearance
of cotinine following bolus and infusion dosing was significantly different.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more recent rat model [Ex. 255] featured a physiologically based description of nicotine kinetics and a compartmental
description of cotinine. This model provided a successful description of the plasma kinetics of both nicotine and
cotinine for intraarterial or intravenous bolus dosing of nicotine. The timecourse of nicotine in most tissues was
also consistent with first order kinetics; however, it was necessary to include a description of saturable nicotine
binding in the brain, heart, and lung to adequately reproduce nicotine concentration profiles in these tissues.
This rat model has also been scaled for use in predicting mouse and human pharmacokinetics [Ex. 4&hyph;254]. The human
model has recently been expanded to include a physiological description of cotinine as well as a forearm compartment,
and is now able to describe nicotine and cotinine kinetics following intravenous infusion of nicotine in humans [Ex.
4&hyph;266]. Another human model [Ex. 4&hyph;270] has also been developed which includes physiological descriptions
of both nicotine and cotinine. This model, which assumes linear kinetics, predicts results which agree with published
data on the kinetics of nicotine and cotinine in blood following nicotine infusion as well as cotinine in the blood
following the infusion of cotinine.

6. Application of Pharmacokinetic Modeling for ETS Exposure Estimation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both of the human models described above possess a reasonable biologically based structure, and either model would
provide a useful starting point for the development of a PBPK model which could be of use in examining the relationship
between cotinine concentrations in body fluids and inhaled nicotine. However, neither of the models currently possesses
all of the features which would be necessary for such an analysis. The most useful application of PBPK modeling would
appear to be to support an analysis of four issues related to the use of cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure: (1) Estimation
of the contribution of dietary intake of nicotine to cotinine levels in the plasma, saliva and urine of nonsmokers;
(2) Estimation of a plausible upper bound for cotinine concentrations in plasma, saliva and urine associated with
ETS exposure (to identify individuals wrongfully identifying themselves as nonsmokers). This can be viewed as a
way to validate misclassification results derived from surveys; (3) Evaluation of the potential impact of high affinity,
low capacity binding of nicotine and cotinine in nonsmokers with low exposure to ETS; and (4) Evaluation of the potential
impact of pharmacokinetic uncertainty and variability on the use of cotinine concentrations in plasma, saliva or
urine to infer an individual's ETS exposure. The necessary features for accomplishing these analyses include both
inhalation and oral routes of nicotine exposure, a salivary compartment, and a description of nicotine binding in
the brain, heart and lung.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the use of cotinine as a biomarker of ETS exposure, two kinds of uncertainty must be considered. The first
kind of uncertainty embraces those factors which could tend to bias a risk estimate. Two such factors are dietary intake
of nicotine and nicotine binding. In both of these cases, the impact of ignoring the effect, if it were significant,
would be to overestimate exposure (and therefore risk) for the least exposed individuals. The second kind of uncertainty
includes those factors which tend to broaden the confidence interval for the risk estimate. The most significant
factors in this category are uncertainty in the fraction of nicotine converted to free cotinine, and the rates of metabolic
and urinary clearance of nicotine and cotinine. An example of such uncertainty is results reported for half-lives
of cotinine in nonsmokers [Ex. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73, 4&hyph;82, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;186], showing a mean of 16.2
hours, with a coefficient of variation of 0.22.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Analysis of Uncertainty
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is useful in this evaluation to distinguish uncertainty from variability. As it relates to the issue of using pharmacokinetic
modeling in risk assessment, uncertainty can be defined as the possible error in estimating the ``true'' value of
a parameter for a representative (``average'') individual. Variability, on the other hand, represents differences
from individual to individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of evaluating the usefulness of pharmacokinetic modeling for estimating exposure, the uncertainty
and variability in the various parameters for the pharmacokinetic models can be grouped into four classes: the physiological
parameters (volumes and flows), the tissue distribution parameters (partitioning and binding), and the kinetic
parameters (absorption, metabolism, and clearance).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Physiological Parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The physiological parameters include (1) the body weight and the weights of the individual organs or tissue groups,
(2) the total blood flow and flows to each organ or tissue group, and (3) the alveolar ventilation rate. These quantities
have been reasonably well established for the human [Exs. 4&hyph;155, 4&hyph;309] and the chief effort associated
with pharmacokinetic model parameterization in the human is the determination of the necessary level of detail for
the physiological description, grouping of the tissues not meriting a separate description into pharmacokinetically
similar groups, and the association of the proper volume and flow data with the selected groupings. Existing models
for nicotine and cotinine contain a fairly detailed physiological structure and differ only slightly in their assignment
of tissues. The model of Plowchalk and deBethizy [Ex. 4&hyph;254] includes separate compartments for the brain,
heart, and skin. The first two of these tissues are lumped into a ``vessel-rich'' tissue compartment in the model of
Robinson et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;270], and the skin is lumped in with the muscle. Conversely, the gastrointestinal tract
is given a separate compartment in the Robinson model but is lumped into a ``slowly perfused'' tissue compartment
in the Plowchalk model. These differences mainly reflect the different interests of the modeling groups in terms
of target organs and routes of exposure. The Robinson model contains a venous infusion compartment to accommodate
the mixing time for arterial administration. The published Plowchalk model does not include this feature, but a forearm
compartment has since been added to provide a similar function [Ex. 4&hyph;83]. Neither model appears to contain
an explicit description of inhalation or oral exposure, but the necessary equations could easily be added to the existing
physiological structures. A salivary fluid compartment could also be added to either model if desired. Experience
with other chemicals has shown that uncertainty in the physiological parameters generally has much less impact on
overall model uncertainty because they are known relatively well and are not as influential on model behavior as the
distribution and kinetic parameters [Ex. 4&hyph;56].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(b) Distributional Parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In both of the published human models, the tissue partitioning was initially estimated on the basis of steady-state
tissue/blood concentration ratios measured in animals. The partitioning parameters in the Robinson model were
then iteratively adjusted to fit other timecourse data. The resulting partition coefficients in the two models differ
by a factor from two to five in corresponding tissues. The partitioning data for cotinine, determined by Gabrelsson
and Bondesson [Ex. 4&hyph;112], show a similar level of uncertainty; partitions for cotinine following infusion
of nicotine were two- to five-fold higher than the same partitions following infusion of cotinine. The lack of reproducibility
of these data represents a deficiency in the development of PBPK modeling for these chemicals. Fortunately, the partition
coefficients tend to be less important than the kinetic parameters in terms of overall model performance. To a large
extent, as long as the volume of distribution associated with the physiological structure and partition coefficients
is in agreement with the apparent pharmacokinetic volume of distribution for each chemical, the model will perform
adequately in terms of timecourses in blood and urine. This was evidenced by the ability of the Robinson model to reproduce
published nicotine and cotinine pharmacokinetic data [Ex. 4&hyph;270]. A potentially more significant uncertainty
associated with distribution is the possibility of pharmacokinetically significant tissue binding of nicotine.
Satisfactory description of the timecourse of nicotine in the brain, lung, and heart of the rat required the inclusion
of binding in these tissues [Ex. 4&hyph;255]. Clearly, the relatively low capacity, high affinity binding associated
with nicotine is unlikely to effect total systemic clearance except at very low concentrations. However, the existence
of nonlinear pharmacokinetics at low concentrations could lead to a miscalculation of exposure for the least exposed
individuals. It has been suggested that there is a longer clearance half-life for nicotine, and therefore cotinine,
associated with low circulating concentrations, and that this longer half-life is due to the slower release of nicotine
bound to tissues [Exs. 4&hyph;28, 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;167]. To date, no careful pharmacokinetic investigation of
this possibility has been performed in the human model, and adequate nicotine-specific tissue binding information
does not appear to have been collected except perhaps in the brain.

(c) Kinetic Parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By far the most significant parameters in the models are those describing the absorption, metabolism, and clearance
of nicotine and cotinine. The Robinson model uses reported human hepatic and renal clearance values for nicotine
and cotinine. The sensitivity of this model to these input parameters was investigated by varying them within the
range of reported clearance values from infusion studies in humans. The resulting model predictions for post-infusion
blood levels, urinary output, and the elimination half-lives of both nicotine and cotinine were found to be well within
the ranges of those observed in human studies. Thus the model structure does not produce an exaggerated response to
variation of the input parameters, and reflects the natural interaction between measures of clearance, volume of
distribution, and rates of elimination. In the case of the physiological parameters, variability dominates over
uncertainty, while for the distributional parameters, uncertainty dominates. In the case of the kinetic parameters
describing clearance, it appears that variability again dominates. For example, the mean values for the terminal
half-life of cotinine reported in different studies range from 12 to 21 hours in non-smokers [Exs. 4&hyph;24, 4&hyph;73,
4&hyph;82, 4&hyph;184, 4&hyph;186]. The coefficient of variation in these same studies, a measure of interindividual
variability, ranges from 17&hyph;22%, and the coefficient of variation for the entire collection of reported individual
values is similar: 22% (N=35, mean=16.2). A review of the published data on infusion of nicotine and cotinine in humans
[Ex. 4&hyph;270] found a 3-fold variation in reported half-lives for cotinine. For comparison, the variation in
the volume of distribution for cotinine was 5-fold, while for the half-life and volume of distribution of nicotine,
the variation was 8-fold and 6-fold, respectively. An even greater level of variability can be expected for the kinetic
parameters for the renal clearance of nicotine and cotinine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the Agency's responsibility to determine in the first instance what it considers to be a ``significant'' risk.
Some risks are plainly acceptable and others are plainly unacceptable. If, for example, the odds are one in a billion
that a person will die from cancer by taking a drink of chlorinated water, the risk clearly could not be considered significant.
On the other hand, if the odds are one in a thousand that regular inhalation of gasoline vapors that are 2% benzene will
be fatal, a reasonable person might well consider the risk significant and take the appropriate steps to decrease
or eliminate it. (

A. Environmental Tobacco Smoke
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the adverse health effects associated with exposure to ETS are lung cancer and heart disease (coronary heart
disease, excluding strokes). Clinically, lung cancer is almost always fatal. However, heart disease runs the gamut
from severe to disabling to fatal. Both of these diseases then constitute the type of ``material impairment of health
or functional capacity'' which the Act seeks to reduce or eliminate. Therefore a standard aimed at reducing the incidence
of these impairments is an appropriate exercise of the Secretary's regulatory authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case before us the Agency estimates that there will be approximately between 144 and 722 cases of lung cancer
per year among nonsmoking American workers exposed to ETS in the workplace. When considered over a working lifetime,
this translates into an excess lung cancer rate in the workplace of one per thousand. As noted above, the Benzene court
clearly indicated that a risk of one in a thousand could be considered significant and that the Agency would be justified
in prescribing reasonable efforts to reduce such a risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the risk from lung cancer associated with worker exposure to ETS in the workplace meets the Benzene court's
characterization of what could be considered significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in evaluating the significance of the risk posed by any particular workplace hazard, the Secretary is
entitled to take into consideration not only the rate of risk but the total number of workers exposed to such risk and
the absolute magnitude of effects. In this case, evidence in the record shows that approximately between 144 and 722
lung cancer deaths per year are attributable to ETS and that there are presently over 74 million nonsmoking American
workers exposed to ETS in their places of employment. On the basis of these data, it would also be reasonable to conclude
that Agency action is warranted to reduce this widespread and significant risk, although the Agency would reach this
conclusion even without the great magnitude of effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, cancer is not the only serious adverse health effect associated with exposure to ETS. Preliminary
estimates indicate that the risk of mortality from heart disease due to ETS exposure is even greater than that of cancer.
The Agency estimates that there will be between 2,094 and 13,000 deaths from heart disease per year among nonsmoking
American workers exposed to ETS in the workplace. When considered over a working lifetime, this translates into an
excess death rate of approximately between 7 and 16 cases of heart disease per thousand attributed to workplace exposure
to ETS. Clearly, this risk is significant in itself and combined with the lung cancer risk, the significance of risk
is very great. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal seeks to protect nonsmoking employees from the hazards of exposure to ETS in the workplace. It does this
by prescribing the conditions under which employees would be allowed to smoke in the workplace, that is, only in separately
enclosed designated areas which are separately ventilated. No employee can be required to work in an area where there
will be contamination from ETS. This in OSHA's view reduces significant risk to only a small percentage of the current
risk. To the extent that there are failures of enforcement of the smoking limitation and of the ventilation system,
the risk will not be totally eliminated. Since there is no definition of, nor an established method for quantifying,
exposure, it is not possible to determine a ``dose limit'' that would eliminate significant risk. Even if that were
possible, it is not clear it would be the correct policy approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29 CFR Part 1990_Identification, Classification and Regulation of Potential Occupational Carcinogens sets forth
certain procedures for regulating occupational carcinogens. Those procedures may not allow for the level of public
input and policy review that is appropriate for this rulemaking, involving many different types of health effects
and a broad range of employers and workers. Accordingly, the Assistant Secretary finds pursuant to 29 CFR Section
1911.4 that ``in order to provide greater procedural protections to interested persons or for other good cause consistent
with the applicable laws'' ``it is found necessary or appropriate'' to adopt different procedures here.

Poor indoor air quality creates a variety of material impairments of health, two aspects of which are Building-Related
Illness and Sick Building Syndrome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most severe health effects associated with Building-Related Illness is legionellosis, a disease associated
with microbial contamination of water sources which is commonly found in the water present in heating and cooling
systems of buildings. Legionnaire's disease, caused by the

very severe, requiring substantial treatment or hospitalization. As many as 5% of those exposed to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Legionnaire's disease and other illnesses associated with microbial contamination due to poor indoor air quality
are serious health effects that constitute material impairment. Compliance with the indoor air quality provisions
set forth in the proposal will substantially reduce these illnesses.

Raw figures from 1992 show approximately 1300 cases of Legionella reported although this is most certainly a gross
under-estimation of the scope of the problem, since the disease resembles others and is frequently misdiagnosed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are numerous other adverse health effects such as nausea, dizziness, fatigue, pulmonary edema, asthma and
aggravation of existing cardiovascular disease, which have been associated with poor indoor air quality. Evidence
in the record indicates that between 20 and 30% of office buildings are ``sick'', having environments which may lead
to a variety of these effects. Unfortunately, quantitative data are not systematically available on all of these
effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of risk evaluation, however, as explained more fully in the risk assessment discussion, the Agency has
primarily focussed on two health effects commonly associated with poor indoor air quality: upper respiratory symptoms
and severe headaches. The upper respiratory symptoms associated with poor indoor air quality (sick building syndrome)
include stuffy nose, runny nose, dry itchy eyes, nose and throat. For purposes of our evaluation, ``severe headaches''
are defined as those serious enough to require medical attention or restrict activity, but excludes migraines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike lung cancer and heart disease (health effects associated with exposure to ETS), these effects will not lead
to death. There is no doubt, however, that OSHA does have the authority to regulate working conditions that lead to
the type of upper respiratory effects and severe headaches described herein.

Clearly the upper respiratory effects and severe headaches associated with poor indoor air quality are of the type
that interfere with the performance of work. The severe headaches were such that medical treatment had to be sought;
certainly such headaches were impairing at the time they occurred, even though they were not permanent. The upper
respiratory symptoms were also severe enough to either require medical attention or restrict activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is ample precedent in OSHA rulemaking proceedings for the regulation of working conditions to avoid health
impairments that are material but not life threatening. The Supreme Court in the cotton dust case,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concluded that OSHA had the authority to promulgate regulations that would avoid Byssinosis, a respiratory disease
which in the large majority of cases is not deadly or disabling, and is reversible if the employee left the cotton mills.
Stage 1/2 byssinosis, the most frequent type, has relatively mild symptoms. In the case of occupational exposure
to formaldehyde, the regulation was designed to avoid, among other things, sensory irritation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
are deadly or severe. Although the rate of risk may not be as large as 1/1000 because the number of employees at risk is
large. This effect alone makes a substantial contribution to a finding of significant risk, especially when taking
into account the large number of cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the severe headaches, the Agency estimates that the excess risk of developing the type of non-migraine headache
which may need medical attention or restrict activity which has been associated with poor indoor air quality is 57
per 1,000 exposed employees. In addition the excess risk of developing upper respiratory symptoms which are severe
enough to require medical attention or restrict activity is estimated to be 85 per 1,000 exposed employees. These
numbers are extrapolated from actual field studies and therefore show the magnitude of the problem at present. There
is no doubt that better maintenance of ventilation systems such as required in the proposal will improve the quality
of air in covered workplaces and reduce the number of cases. In addition the types of good practices prescribed in the
proposal will substantially reduce the type of microbial contamination associated with Legionnaire's disease.
Therefore, OSHA concludes that this number of less severe effects along with the severe effects from Legionnaire's
disease, together, constitute a significant risk. Accordingly, OSHA preliminarily concludes that, the proposal
will substantially reduce a significant risk of material impairment of health from poor indoor air quality.

VI. Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12886 requires a Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis to be prepared
for any regulation that meets the criteria for a ``significant regulatory action.'' One of these criteria, relevant
to this rulemaking is that the rule have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more per year. Based upon the preliminary
analysis presented below, OSHA finds that the proposed standard will constitute a significant regulatory action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimates presented in this Phase 1 Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis demonstrate technological and economic
feasibility of the proposed standard. The analysis provides a non-detailed preliminary count of the affected employees
and buildings, the associated costs, and benefits of the proposed standard provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA estimates the annual cost of compliance with the IAQ standard to be $8.1 billion, of which the most costly provision
will be for the building systems operation and maintenance, $8.0 billion. The cost for eliminating exposure to ETS
may range from $0 to $68 million depending on whether establishments ban smoking or allow smoking in designated areas.
In order to assess the overall economic impact of the rule, OSHA also estimated the cost savings to employers, or cost
savings that will result from the implementation of the proposed standard. The major forms of these savings are efficiency
and productivity improvements, cost reductions in operations and maintenance, and reduced incidence of property
damage. Cost savings associated with productivity improvements are estimated to be $15 billion annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA preliminarily estimates that the proposed standard will prevent 3.0 million severe headaches and 4.5 million
upper respiratory symptoms over the next 45 years. This is, approximately, 69,000 severe headaches and 105,000 upper
respiratory symptoms per year. These estimates understate the prevalence of building-related symptoms since they
reflect excess risk in only air conditioned buildings. In addition, 5,583 to 32,502 lung cancer deaths and 97,700
to 577,818 coronary heart disease deaths related to occupational exposure to ETS will be prevented over the next 45
years. This represents 140 to 722 lung cancer deaths per year and 2,094 to 13,001 heart disease deaths per year.

B. Industry Profile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental concern for air pollution has been largely focussed on questions of outdoor air contamination.
Recently, however, attention has begun to shift to concerns about the quality of air within buildings since people
spend 80 to 90 percent of their time indoors [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indoor air is a variable complex mixture of chemicals and airborne particles. Its composition largely depends on
the outdoor environment (urban or rural area), the shelter itself (age, construction material, electric equipment,
heating, cooling, and ventilation systems), the activities of the occupants (smoking, nonsmoking, cooking by gas,
oil or electricity) and the presence of plants and animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Industry Profile chapter characterizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building stock and describes the factors that affect indoor air quality. This section also presents the number of
employees who work in buildings whose indoor air will be affected by the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Affected Industries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The standard covers all OSHA regulated industries: Agriculture, Oil and Gas Extraction (SIC 13), Manufacturing,
Transportation, Communications, Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, Finance, Insurance and Real Estate and Services.
The scope of the proposal is twofold. The proposed indoor air quality compliance provisions would only cover employers
with non-industrial work environments. This includes public and private buildings, schools, healthcare facilities,
offices and office areas. Coverage also applies to nonindustrial work environments that are part of industrial worksites
(e.g., an office, cafeteria, or break room located at a manufacturing facility). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions for protecting the nonsmoking employees from exposure to ETS apply to all indoor or enclosed work environments,
in industrial and nonindustrial establishments. This would include maritime, construction, and agricultural
workplaces.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indoor air contaminants emanate from a broad array of sources that can originate both outside of structures as well
as from within a building. When a building is new, some contaminants are given off quickly and soon disappear. Others
continue off-gassing at a slow pace for years. Common office supplies and equipment have been found to release hazardous
chemicals_especially duplicators and copiers. Bulk paper stores have been found to release formaldehyde [Ex. 3&hyph;1087A20].
Some typical contaminants are listed below:

People contribute millions of particles to the indoor air primarily through the shedding of skin scales. Many of these
scales carry microbes, most of which are short lived and harmless. Clothing, furnishings, draperies, carpets, etc.
contribute fibers and other fragments. Cleaning processes, sweeping, vacuuming, dusting normally remove the larger
particles, but often increase the airborne concentrations of the smaller particles. Cooking, broiling, grilling,
gas and oil burning, smoking, coal and wood generate vast numbers of airborne indoor pollutants in various classifications.

3. Controlling Indoor Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Control of pollutants at the source is the most effective strategy for maintaining clean indoor air. However, control
or mitigation of all sources is not always possible or practical. In the case of ETS, this means restricting smoking
to separately ventilated spaces. General ventilation is, therefore, the second most effective approach to providing
acceptable indoor air [Exs. 3&hyph;1061G, 3&hyph;1075J].

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Outside air dilutes and removes contaminants through natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation or through infiltration
and exfiltration. Natural ventilation occurs when desired air flows occur through windows, doors, chimneys and
other building openings. Mechanical ventilation is the mechanically induced movement of air through the building.
Mechanical systems usually condition and filter the air and allow for the entry of outdoor air through outdoor dampers.
Infiltration is the unwanted movement of air through cracks and openings into the building shell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The outside air ventilation rate of a building affects indoor air quality. It determines the extent to which contaminants
are diluted and removed from the indoor environment. The extent to which outside air ventilation is effective in diluting
indoor contaminants depends on how well outside air is mixed with indoor air and is reflected by ventilation efficiency.
Ventilation efficiency can be reduced by air short-circuiting from the supply diffusers to the return inlets, by
modular furniture partitions, and differences between the supply air temperature and the room air temperature.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate at which outside air is supplied to a building is specified by the building code at the design stage. Outside
air ventilation rates are based primarily on the need to control odors and carbon dioxide levels (e.g., occupant-generated
contaminants or bioeffluents). Carbon dioxide is a component of outdoor air whose excessive accumulation indoors
can indicate inadequate ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lack of adequate ventilation contributes to indoor air related health complaints. Specific deficiencies that produce
air quality problems include inadequate outside air supply, poor air distribution, poor air mixing (and therefore
poor ventilation efficiency), inadequate control of humidity, insufficient maintenance of the ventilation system,
inadequate HVAC system capacity and inadequate exhaust from occupied areas. Inadequate outdoor air supply and distribution
and insufficient control of thermal conditions can result from strategies to control energy consumption. In approximately
500 indoor air quality investigations conducted in the late 1970's and early 1980's, the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) found that the primary causes of indoor air quality problems were inadequate ventilation
(52%), contamination from outside the building (10%), microbial contamination (5%), contamination from building
fabric (4%) and unknown sources (13%) [56 FR 47892]. To date, NIOSH has conducted over 1,100 IAQ related investigations,
but has not yet evaluated them to provide updated estimates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA, therefore, believes that it is necessary to require maintenance of the HVAC system components that directly
affect IAQ, since failure to do so results in the degradation of IAQ. Standards of HVAC maintenance vary and sometimes
are deficient where untrained personnel are designated to maintain complex systems. It is, also, customary for companies
to defer maintenance for economic and budgetary reasons, with adverse impacts on IAQ. Some examples of maintenance
deficiencies include: plugged drains on cooling coil condensate drip pans (resulting in microbial contamination);
failed exhaust fans in underground parking garages; microbial fouling of cooling tower water from lack of water treatment
with biocides resulting in legionellosis cases; and failure of the automatic temperature control system resulting
in lack of outside ventilation air.

4. Building Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the last 25 years, technical and socioeconomic changes have profoundly influenced the methods employed to
plan, design, construct and operate buildings. Buildings system design, maintenance and operation can, and regularly
do, provide acceptable indoor environments. However, neglect or disregard of the sources of indoor air contaminants,
or of the proper design, operation and maintenance of building system components which influence indoor air quality
can create an uncomfortable and unhealthy indoor atmosphere [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H2]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The oil embargo of 1973 brought about the realization that considerable savings could be made in reducing the consumption
of energy used to heat and cool buildings. Prior to 1973, the energy to heat and cool buildings was much cheaper and the
buildings reflected that reality. Building enclosures had lower insulating values and allowed more infiltration.
More air was circulated to the occupied spaces and more outdoor air was provided for ventilation. This resulted in
a lower concentration of pollutants and higher velocities of air motion in indoor air. Office buildings were divided
into individual rooms with their own walls as opposed to the current practice of open spaces with movable screens [Ex.
4&hyph;74]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The centralization of services and the expanding economy have led to concentration of office space in the cities.
The cost of land has shaped buildings into high-rise structures. The cost of materials and popularity of mirror glass
has led to the sprouting of hundreds of what may be termed ``glass boxes''. These boxes are sealed to keep out noise and
pollution_mainly from traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Buildings designed after 1973 have incorporated many energy conservation measures that range from adjusting thermal
comfort zones to increased awareness of lighting efficiency, to designing new operating methods for ``sealed building''
[Ex.3&hyph;1159, p.1]. In large buildings, outside air ventilation rates were also reduced by closing outside air
dampers in mechanical ventilation systems at nights, on weekends and sometimes even during occupancy. As a result
of these measures, which primarily reduced costs for conditioning outdoor air as opposed to increasing energy efficiency,
considerable energy savings have been achieved in buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, during the 1970's variable air volume (VAV) HVAC systems became widely accepted. VAV systems condition
supply air to a constant temperature and insure thermal comfort by varying the airflow. Early VAV systems did not allow
control of the outside air quantity, so that a decreasing amount of outside air was provided as the flow of supply air
was reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, building design flaws contribute to the poor quality of indoor air, such as locating air intake vents
near to a loading dock or parking garage. Design flaws of interior space also contribute to indoor air problems. Most
building cooling systems are designed to remove the heat generated by office machines, employees and light. The heat
generated by these sources often exceeds the capacity of the HVAC system to remove it [Ex.3&hyph;1159C1]. Ideally
with effective filtration and management systems, the air indoors should be cleaner than the air outdoors.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Estimates of the number of buildings potentially affected by the indoor air standard were developed by OSHA based
on Department of Energy's commercial building energy consumption survey (CBEC) 1989
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 [Ex. 4&hyph;303]. There is a total of 4.5 million commercial buildings in the United States. Commercial buildings
are defined as all non-manufacturing/industrial and non-residential structures. Table VI&hyph;1 presents the
distribution of buildings by use, occupancy and thermal conditioning. Approximately 28 percent of all buildings
are for mercantile or services. Other uses include offices (15 percent), assembly and warehouses (14 percent each),
food service (5 percent), lodging (3 percent) and food sales and healthcare (2 percent each). The ``other'' category
(1 percent) covers buildings such as public restrooms and buildings that are 50 percent or more commercial but whose
principal activity is agricultural, industrial/manufacturing or residential.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On average, the largest types of buildings are for education and health care. Mercantile and service buildings account
for the greatest number and floorspace of any single activity category. Office buildings account for nearly as much
floorspace, but far fewer buildings. Together office and mercantile buildings represent almost 40 percent of all
buildings and floorspace. Warehouses and assembly buildings both are almost as numerous as office buildings, but
account for less floorspace. Over 62 percent of buildings have only one floor and 13 percent have three or more floors.
Most buildings (69%) house single establishments. Government occupied buildings represent 13 percent.

The survey also provides information on the number of buildings with heating and air conditioning systems. Total
number of heated buildings is estimated to be 3.9 million. Heating systems include boilers, furnaces, individual
space heaters, and packaged heating units. Almost one-half of all the buildings are heated by forced-air central
systems. Air-distributing heat and cooling systems are most prevalent in office, mercantile and service buildings.
The survey reveals that 70 percent of the buildings have air conditioning. It also shows that 80 percent of the buildings
have heat and air conditioning, and 12 percent have heat, but no air conditioning.

Over 40 percent of the floorspace built since 1986 was in a building with a computerized energy management and control
systems (EMCS). EMCS is an energy conservation feature that uses mini/micro computers, instrumentation, control
equipment and software to manage a building's use of energy for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting
and/or business related processes. These systems can also manage fire control, safety and security. Overall, EMCS
are present in buildings accounting for 23 percent of floorspace. EMCS controls HVAC in only 251,000 buildings or
6 percent of total number of buildings.

However, the DOE survey [Ex. 4&hyph;303] does not provide data by two-digit Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC). The number of buildings by SIC will determine subsequent costs. OSHA applied the DOE estimates of the number
of buildings by type of occupancy (single or multi-tenant) to the number of establishments by two-digit SIC given
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. First, OSHA allocated non-government single tenant buildings (estimated at 3.1
million) across the relative two-digit SIC using the relative two-digit SIC distribution of the number of establishments.
Then, OSHA allocated the 0.8 million non-government multi-establishment buildings across two-digit SIC using
the relative two-digit SIC distribution of the number of establishments in multi-establishment buildings (2.8
million). All government buildings were considered single tenant buildings. OSHA recognizes that this methodology
of classification of buildings by two-digit SIC code may not reflect the fact that establishments in multi-tenant
buildings should be allocated across several SICs or the fact that some single establishment buildings may be concentrated
in certain SICs instead of all SICs. This is particularly true for the agricultural sector for which farms and farm
buildings (silos, grain elevators and barns) are outside the scope of the IAQ portion of the proposal. However, OSHA
does not have the data to provide such delineation at this point. Table VI&hyph;2 presents OSHA's estimate of the number
of buildings by two-digit SIC and by characteristics of occupancy and ventilation system.

6. Buildings With Indoor Air Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Many published reports on building wellness describe buildings in terms of two general categories, sick or well buildings.
Some of the published categories, in addition to the terms sick or well are: problem buildings and non-problem buildings,
healthy buildings; buildings with high and low rates of IAQ related complaints; sick building syndrome (SBS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SBS symptom complex is characterized by a range of symptoms including but not limited to, eye, nose and throat irritation,
dryness of mucous membranes and skin, nose bleeds, skin rash, mental fatigue, headache, cough, hoarseness, wheezing,
nausea and dizziness [Ex. 4&hyph;159]. Within a given building there will usually be some commonality among the symptoms
manifested as well as temporal association between occupancy in the building and appearance of symptoms. Many people
who work in buildings characterized as having SBS typically exhibit health symptoms that disappear when the person
is no longer in the building. In most cases, a physical basis for the occurrence of the SBS can be found: lack of proper
maintenance, changes in thermal or contaminant loads imposed during the building's life, changes in control strategies
to meet new objectives (e.g., energy conservation) or inadequate design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building-related illnesses (BRI), on the other hand, are medically diagnosed diseases that present symptoms that
can last for weeks, months, years or even a lifetime. Examples include nosocomial infections, humidifier fever,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and legionellois. BRI can develop as a result of poor building systems operation
and maintenance and uncontrolled point sources of contaminants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No building has a complete absence of problems, but those that function with minimal occupant complaints and comply
with acceptable criteria for occupant exposure, system performance, maintenance procedures and economic objectives
may be characterized as healthy buildings. Figure VI&hyph;1 below presents the classification of buildings by stages
of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information submitted to the docket, OSHA assumed that 30 percent of the buildings have indoor air quality
problems [Ex. 3&hyph;745].

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The commercial building energy consumption survey estimates that there are 70.7 million employees. However, survey
data do not provide information by two-digit SIC. OSHA examined data obtained through the Bureau of Labor Statistics
to estimate the number of employees by two-digit SIC affected by the proposed standard. The data from the Bureau provided
occupational breakdown of the labor force by detailed industry categories (two-digit SIC) and major occupational
groupings.

OSHA classified employees according to whether or not they work primarily in indoor areas, e.g., areas with possible
exposures, by developing percentages of employees in each occupational category who might be working indoors. For
example, personnel in the transportation industries were apportioned according to those potentially exposed to
indoor air pollution (office workers) and those who are not (truck drivers). Table VI&hyph;3 presents the distribution
of the 70.7 million employees who work indoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No data are available as to the number of employees exposed to poor indoor air quality. Based on OSHA's percentage of
problem buildings (30 percent), OSHA assumed that 30 percent of employees working indoors are exposed to poor indoor
air quality. Therefore, the number of employees potentially affected is 21 million.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) represents one of the strongest sources of indoor air contaminants in buildings
where smoking is permitted. ETS is a mixture of irritating gases and carcinogenic tar particles and is considered
one of the most widespread and harmful indoor air pollutants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 State and Local Governments have adopted an increasing number of ordinances and regulations limiting smoking in
public and private worksites. The restrictiveness of these laws varies from simple, limited prohibitions to laws
that ban smoking. Forty-five states and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in public workplaces and 19 states
and the District of Columbia restrict smoking in private workplaces.

There are 397 city and county smoking ordinances covering 22 percent of the total population [Ex. 4&hyph;305]. A total
of 297 cities and counties mandate the adoption of workplace smoking policies. Typically these provisions require
employers (private and public) to maintain a written smoking policy. Ordinances range from requirements for written
smoking policies to the total elimination of smoking in the workplace. A total of 505 cities and counties limit smoking,
specifically in restaurants. The requirements range from a nonsmoking section of unspecified size to the banning
of all smoking [Ex. 4&hyph;305]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A 1991 survey of company smoking policies shows that of the 85 percent of firms with smoking policies, 34 percent have
complete bans and another 34 percent prohibit smoking in all open work areas. Over 90 percent of non-manufacturing
establishments have smoking policies [H&hyph;030 Ex. 77]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workplace smoking policies are more common in larger businesses. In a survey of personnel managers, 63 percent of
those with 1,000 or more employees reported having a smoking policy compared with 52 percent of companies with fewer
employees. In the same survey, smaller companies were half as likely as larger ones to have a policy under consideration.
Similar findings were reported by the National Survey of Worksite Health Promotion Activities, in which larger worksites
were more likely than smaller ones to report smoking control activities. In a survey of private New York city businesses,
only 4 percent of companies with fewer than 100 employees had a written smoking policy [Ex. 3&hyph;1030Q].

(b) Number of nonsmokers working indoors. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the National Health Interview Survey, OSHA estimated that 74.2 million employees or 73.01 percent of the
U.S. labor force covered by OSHA are nonsmokers. Table VI&hyph;4 presents the distribution of nonsmoking employees
by two digit SIC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of population based surveys show that 88 percent of nonsmokers are aware of the negative health consequences
of ETS. Despite this general awareness, exposure to ETS is pervasive [Ex. 4&hyph;98]. To determine the occupational
exposure of nonsmoking employees to ETS, OSHA used the estimate provided by the 1991 National Health Interview Survey.
The survey, requested information from employed individuals on whether during the past two weeks anyone smoked in
their immediate work area. Based on results adjusted for non-response and weighted to reflect national estimates,
18.81 percent reported exposure to ETS. OSHA believes that the 18.8 percent is an underestimate since it is based solely
on self reported information and the question was not very specific in defining ``immediate'' work area. A recent
reanalysis of a study by Cummings et al. [Ex. 4&hyph;68] shows that 48.67 percent of currently employed nonsmokers
reported ETS exposure at work and not at home [Ex. 3&hyph;442F].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
(1) Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The declared purpose of the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 is ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;to assure
so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our
human resources.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' Thus, the Act requires the Secretary of Labor, when promulgating
occupational safety and health standards for toxic materials or harmful physical agents, to set the standard ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;that
most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will
suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity.&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*'' It is on the basis of this
congressional directive that OSHA has initiated regulatory actions to reduce the adverse health effects associated
with occupational exposure to indoor air pollutants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below assesses the requisite preconditions for optimal safety in the context of a free market economy,
and real world economic factors are compared with the free market paradigm to illustrate the shortcoming of the nonregulatory
environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
(2) Market Imperfections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Economic theory suggests that the need for government regulation is greatly reduced where private markets work efficiently
and effectively to allocate health and safety resources. The theory typically assumes perfectly competitive labor
markets where employees, having perfect knowledge of job risks and being perfectly mobile among jobs, command wage
premiums that fully compensate for any risk of future harm. Thus, theoretically, the costs of occupational injury
and illness are borne initially by the firms responsible for the hazardous workplace conditions and ultimately by
the consumers who pay for the final goods and services produced by these firms. With all costs internalized, private
employers have an incentive to reduce hazards wherever the cost of hazard abatement is less than the total cost to the
firm, the work force, and society of the expected injury or illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conditions of perfect competition do not need to be completely satisfied in order for the forces of the market to
approximate an efficient outcome. However, some market imperfections can produce sub-optimal results that can
be improved upon with regulatory action. In the case of this rulemaking, employees face a significant health risk
which is not adequately addressed by current nonregulatory alternatives. OSHA, therefore, believes that it must
take appropriate actions to provide greater health protection for workers exposed to toxic substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although OSHA believes that adequate job safety and health could exist in the private market under perfect conditions,
the private market often fails to provide acceptable levels of safety and health in instances where these conditions
are not met. It appears that at least two of several conditions traditionally considered essential components of
perfect markets are absent from the environment in which employees are exposed to hazards associated with exposure
to indoor pollutants: (1) Perfect employee knowledge of risks and (2) perfect employee mobility between jobs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, evidence on occupational health hazards in general suggests that in the absence of immediate or clear-cut
danger, employees and employers have little incentive to seek or provide information on the potential long-term
effects of exposure. Employers faced with potentially high compensatory payments may, in fact, have a disincentive
to provide information to employees. When relevant information is provided, however, employers and employees might
still find informed decisionmaking a difficult task, especially where long latency periods precede the development
of chronic disabling disease. Moreover, if signs and symptoms are nonspecific_that is, if an illness could be job-related
or could have other causes_employees and employers may not link disease with such occupational exposure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, even if workers were fully informed of the health risks associated with exposure to hazardous substances,
many face limited employment options. Nontransferability of occupational skills and high national unemployment
rates sharply reduce a worker's expectation of obtaining alternative employment quickly or easily.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many regions of the country, the practical choice for workers is not between a safe job and a better paying but more
hazardous position, but simply between employment and unemployment at the prevailing rates of pay and risk. In addition
to the fear of substantial income loss from prolonged periods of unemployment, the high costs of relocation, the reluctance
to break family and community ties, and the growth of institutional factors such as pension plans and seniority rights
serve to elevate the cost of job transfer. Thus, especially where wages are more responsive to the demands of more mobile
workers who tend to be younger and perhaps less aware of job risks, hazard premiums for the average worker will not be
fully compensated. Where this is the case, labor market negotiations are unlikely to reflect accurately the value
that workers place on health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these market imperfections, externalities occur if employers and employees settle for an inefficiently
low level of protection from hazardous substances. For the competitive market to function efficiently, only workers
and their employers should be affected by the level of safety and health provided in market transactions. In the case
of occupational safety and health, however, society shares part of the financial burden of occupationally induced
diseases, including the costs of premature death, chronic illness, and disability. Those individuals who suffer
from occupationally related illnesses are cared for and compensated by society through taxpayer support of social
programs, including welfare, Social Security, and Medicare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If private employers do not have to pay the full cost of production, they have no economic incentive to reduce hazards
whenever the cost of hazard abatement is greater than the cost of the expected illness. In this way, the private market
fails to produce optimal levels of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
(3) Alternative Non-regulatory Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Based on the above evidence, OSHA has concluded that the private market has failed to provide optimal levels of safety
to employees. Consequently, some form of intervention that fosters safer work environments must be used to reduce
occupational exposure. Because such intervention need not occur through government regulation, OSHA has considered
the effectiveness of other non-regulatory options: (1) relying on tort litigation and (2) relying on workers' compensation
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Tort Liability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of liability under tort law is one nonregulatory alternative that has been increasingly used in litigation
concerning occupationally related illnesses. Prosser [Ex. 4&hyph;256] describes a tort, in part, as a ``civil wrong,
other than a breach of contract, for which the court will provide a remedy in the form of an action for damages''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the tort system applies, it would allow a worker whose health has been adversely affected by occupational exposure
to a hazardous substance to sue and recover damages from the employer. Thus, if the tort system is effectively applied,
it might shift the liability of direct costs of occupational disease from the worker to the firm under certain specific
circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With very limited exceptions, however, the tort system is not a viable alternative in dealings between employees
and employers. All states have legislation providing that Workers' Compensation is either the exclusive or principal
remedy available to employees against their employers. Thus, under tort law, workers with an occupational disease
caused by exposure to a hazardous substance can only file a product liability suit against a third party manufacturer,
processor, distributor, sales firm, or contractor. It is often difficult, however, to demonstrate a direct link
between an exposure to a hazardous substance and the illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to pursue litigation successfully, there must be specific knowledge of the magnitude and duration of a worker's
exposure to a hazardous substance, as well as the causal link between the disease and the occupational exposure. Usually,
it is extremely difficult to isolate the role of occupational exposures in causing the disease, especially if workers
are exposed to many toxic substances and the exposure is not necessarily limited to the workplace such as the case for
ETS. This difficulty is further compounded by the long latency periods that are frequently involved. In addition,
the liable party must be identifiable, but workers may have several employers over a working lifetime. The burden
of proof that an occupational exposure to a hazardous substance occurred, that a specific employer is the liable party,
and that the exposure level was significant may prohibit the individual from initiating the suit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an increasing number of lawsuits that are related to health effects to building occupants from poor indoor
air quality. These lawsuits are typically filed after the illness or health effect has been diagnosed. In this sense,
increasing pressure is being placed on businesses. However, the legal pressure currently does not relate to the implementation
of a clean indoor air policy (e.g., legal action is not currently being taken just because a company does not have a clean
indoor air policy. These actions are event related as opposed to being policy related). IAQ litigation is growing
rapidly and the focus is shifting from residential to commercial facilities. Examples to emphasize that are the recent
$12.5 million claims against the Social Security Administration for the Richmond, California episode of Legionnaire's
disease, the Call versus Prudential case in which building tenants settled with the defendants in what may have been
the first jury trial in sick building litigation, and a suit by Hamilton, Ohio, county employees against their office
building owners alleging exposure to fumes, bacteria, fungi, dust and irritants [Ex. 3&hyph;575].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legal proceedings do not internalize occupational illness costs because they involve substantial legal fees associated
with bringing about court action. In deciding whether to sue, the tort victim must be sure that the size of the claim
will be large enough to cover legal expenses. In effect, the plaintiff is likely to face substantial transaction costs
in the form of a contingency fee, commonly 33 percent, plus additional legal expenses. The accused firm must also pay
for its defense. The high costs and uncertainties associated with tort law make it an inefficient mechanism for ensuring
adequate protection of workers' health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Insurance and liability costs are not borne in full by the specific employer responsible for the risk involved. For
firms that are insured, the premium determination process is such that premiums only partially reflect changes in
risk associated with changes in exposure to hazardous substances. This lack of complete adjustment is the so-called
``moral hazard'' problem, which is the risk that arises from the possible imprudence of the insured. As the insured
firm has paid an insurance company to assume some of the risks, that firm has less reason to exercise the diligence necessary
to avoid losses. Transfer of risk is a fundamental source of imperfection in markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a growing number of state and local laws and ordinances controlling smoking. Armed with new data that show
health effects from indoor air pollutants, plaintiffs who believe that they have been injured by the air inside their
workplaces are beginning to take the offensive. They are lobbying on the local, state and federal levels for protective
legislation, and in the absence of such legislation, they are suing for damages to their health. These cases are complex
not only in the nature of the technical proof that must be developed and presented, but also in the number of parties
involved. Suits have been filed against architects, builders, contractors, building product manufacturers and
realtors [Ex. 3&hyph;662].

(b) Workers' Compensation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Workers' Compensation system is a result of the perceived inadequacies in liability or insurance systems to compel
employers to prevent occupational disease or compensate workers fully for their losses. The system was designed
to internalize some of the social costs of production, but in reality it has fallen short of compensating workers adequately
for occupationally related disease. Thus, society shares the burden of occupationally related health effects,
premature mortality, excess morbidity, and disability through taxpayer support of social programs such as welfare,
Social Security disability payments, and Medicare.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compensation tends to be inadequate especially in permanent disability cases, in view of the expiration of benefit
entitlement and the failure to adjust benefits for changes in a worker's expected earnings over time. As of January
1987, eight states restricted permanent disability benefits either by specifying a maximum number of weeks for which
benefits could be paid or by imposing a ceiling on dollar payments [Ex. 4&hyph;302].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, time and dollar restrictions on benefit payments are even more prevalent in the area of survivor benefits.
The duration of survivor benefits is often restricted to 10 years, and dollar maximums on survivor payments range
from $7,000 to $60,000. In addition, it should be noted that if the employee dies quickly from the occupational illness
and has no dependents, the employer need pay only nominal damages under Workers' Compensation (e.g., a $1,000 death
benefit).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in spite of current statutory protection, disability from occupational diseases represents a continuing,
complex problem for Workers' Compensation programs. Occupational diseases may take years to develop, and more than
one causal agent may be involved in their onset. Consequently, disabilities resulting from occupationally induced
illness often are less clearly defined than those from occupationally induced injury. As a result, Workers' Compensation
is often a weak remedy in the case of occupational disease. Indeed, there is some evidence indicating that the great
majority of occupationally induced illnesses are never reported or compensated [Ex. 4&hyph;84].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The insurance premiums paid by a firm under the Workers' Compensation system are generally not experience rated;
that is, they do not reflect the individual firm's job safety and health record. About 80 percent of all firms are ineligible
for experience rating because of their small size. Such firms are class rated, and rate reductions are granted only
if the experience of the entire class improves. Even when firms have an experience rating, the premiums paid may not
accurately reflect the true economic losses. Segregation of loss experience into classes is somewhat arbitrary,
and an individual firm may be classified with other firms that have substantially different normal accident rates.
An experience rating is generally based on the benefits paid to workers, not on the firm's safety record. Thus, employers
may have a greater incentive to reduce premiums by contesting claims than by initiating safety measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Workers' Compensation system suffers from several shortcomings that seriously reduce its effectiveness
in providing incentives for firms to create safe and healthful workplaces. The scheduled benefits are significantly
less than the actual losses to the injured workers, and recovery is often very difficult in the case of occupational
diseases. Thus, the existence of a Workers' Compensation system limits an employer's liability significantly below
the actual costs of the injury. In addition, premiums for individual firms are unlikely to be specifically related
to that firm's risk environment. The firm, therefore, does not receive the proper economic signals and consequently
fails to invest sufficient resources in reducing workplace injuries and illnesses. The economic costs not borne
by the employer are borne by the employee or, as is often the case, by society through public insurance and welfare programs.

(4) Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA believes that there are no nonregulatory alternatives that adequately protect workers from the adverse health
effects associated with exposure to indoor air pollution. Tort liability laws and Workers' Compensation provide
some protection, but due to market imperfections they have not been sufficient. Some employers have not complied
voluntarily with standards recommended by professional organizations. The deleterious health effects resulting
from continued exposure to hazardous substances require a regulatory solution.

In this chapter, OSHA presents its preliminary estimates of the expected reduction in fatalities and illnesses among
the employees affected by the proposed IAQ standard. A qualitative description of the non-quantifiable additional
cost savings to employers, is also provided.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Health effects typically caused by poor IAQ have been categorized as Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) or Building-Related
Illness (BRI). Some of the symptoms that characterize SBS include: irritation of eyes, nose and throat, dry mucous
membranes and skin and coughs, hoarseness of voice and wheezing, hypersensitivity reaction, nausea and dizziness.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BRI describes specific medical conditions of known etiology such as: Respiratory allergies, legionellosis, humidifier
fever, nosocomial infections, sensory irritation when caused by known agents and the symptoms and signs characteristic
of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, pesticides, endotoxins or
mycotoxins. BRIs do not disappear when the person leaves the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Centers for Disease Control Prevention estimate that over 25,000 cases of the pneumonia caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur each year with more than 4,000 deaths. It has been suggested that a large number of these cases occur as the result
of workplace exposure [Exs. 4&hyph;33, 4&hyph;318]. However, specific data on the occurrence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-related cases due to workplace exposure were not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the reductions attributable to the proposed standard, such as decreases in the number of upper respiratory
symptoms (nose, throat and eye symptoms) and severe headaches have been estimated. Other reductions, however, have
not been quantified at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's estimates are based upon the exposure profile (presented in Table VI&hyph;5) and OSHA's quantitative risk
assessment discussed in detail in the preamble to the proposal). OSHA preliminarily estimates the risk of working
in mechanically ventilated workplaces to be 57 severe headaches and 85 upper respiratory symptoms per 1,000 employees
over a 45 year work lifetime. By applying these rates to the affected population at risk, OSHA estimates that 3.8 million
severe headaches and 5.6 million upper respiratory symptoms will develop in employees over the next 45 years who work
in buildings with mechanical ventilation (with the worker population held constant). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A common theme that runs through the literature and the OSHA docket indicates that the principal factor associated
with indoor air quality complaints is inadequate ventilation. However, information available does not quantify
the effectiveness of ventilation improvements. NEMI reports that: ``ventilation system modifications and improvements
are key elements of solving existing IAQ problems and reducing IAQ complaints. In every case where recommended ventilation
system modifications and improvements are implemented, the frequency and severity of complaints are reduced significantly''
[Ex. 3&hyph;1183]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the submissions base the effectiveness of ventilation improvements on the NIOSH analysis of indoor air quality
investigations [Exs. 3&hyph;1183, 3&hyph;1090]. In approximately 500 indoor air quality investigations, NIOSH
found that the primary causes of indoor air quality problems were inadequate ventilation (52%), contamination from
outside the building (10%), microbial contamination (5%), contamination from building fabric (4%), and unknown
sources (13%). Excluding contamination from building fabric and unknown sources, this suggests that 83 percent
of complaints related to IAQ problems would be eliminated by the proposed OSHA standard. For purposes of this analysis,
OSHA assumes that the overall effectiveness is, therefore, 80 percent. As shown in Table VI&hyph;5, OSHA estimates
that the proposed standard will prevent 3.0 million severe headaches and 4.5 million upper respiratory symptoms
over the next 45 years. This is, approximately, 69,000 severe headaches and 105,000 upper respiratory symptoms per
year. These estimates understate the prevalence of building-related symptoms since they only reflect excess risk
in only air conditioned buildings. OSHA believes that the standard will also prevent severe headaches and upper respiratory
symptoms in heated (but not air conditioned) buildings, and that it will prevent various other adverse health effects.
OSHA is seeking additional information upon which to base quantifiable estimates of the other known adverse health
effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests comment on the methodology of estimating the benefits for the IAQ portion of the proposal. Specifically,
OSHA requests any studies which document (in quantitative terms) the effectiveness of HVAC maintenance on the decline
of indoor air related ailments.

2. Environmental Tobacco Smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tobacco smoke has been classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the Surgeon
General, NIOSH, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The National Health Interview Survey of Cancer Epidemiology
and Control (NHIS-CEC) shows that the prevalence of cigarette smoking continues to decline in smoking among adults
by approximately 0.50 percent per year. Despite these declines, smoking is responsible for an estimated 390,000
deaths. Exposure to ETS has been associated with the occurrence of many diseases, such as lung cancer and heart disease
in nonsmokers and low birthweight in the offspring of nonsmokers.

OSHA's estimates are based upon the exposure profile (presented in Table VI&hyph;3) and OSHA's quantitative risk
assessment (discussed in detail in the preamble to the proposal). The OSHA estimates of lifetime risk of death attributable
to exposure to ETS in the workplace range between 0.4 and 1 for lung cancer and between 7 and 16 for coronary heart disease,
per 1,000 exposed employees. OSHA's estimate of the attributable risks suggest that all baseline cases of lung cancer
and coronary heart disease will be prevented due to elimination of exposure of nonsmokers to ETS in the workplace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table VI&hyph;6 presents estimates of the incidence of work-related cases avoided of lung cancer and heart disease
following either the banning of smoking in the workplace or limiting smoking to designated smoking areas. OSHA estimates
that approximately between 5,583 and 32,502 cancer deaths and 97,700 to 577,818 coronary heart disease deaths related
to occupational exposure to ETS will be prevented over the next 45 years. This represents 140 to 722 cancer deaths per
year and 2,094 to 13,001 heart disease deaths per year.

OSHA has also preliminarily determined that the estimated number of deaths or illnesses prevented understates the
actual benefits that would occur under the proposed standard. Significant additional economic benefits, apart
from the lives saved and illnesses averted, are anticipated most of which can not be quantified at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The major forms of these savings are efficiency and productivity improvements, cost reductions in operations and
maintenance, and reduced incidence of property damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(a) Worker Productivity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Productivity gains are realized when less labor input is required per unit of production. A productivity gain can,
therefore, take the form of either a decrease in the labor hours needed to maintain the level of production or in the
form of increased production and net income for the establishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Productivity losses due to indoor air quality may take several forms: employees may be less effective because they
feel fatigued or suffer from headaches, eye irritation or other effects. Employees may accomplish less per hour worked
or may spend more time away from their work location (e.g., taking breaks or walks outdoor). One company indicated
that ``since two of my employees have refrained from smoking while working .&blank;.&blank;., their production
has increased and their overall health seems better to say nothing of the health of those working around them'' [Ex.
3&hyph;192]. In addition to individual productivity, the quality of indoor air affects organizational productivity
such as the visitor and customer satisfaction, impact on sales and revenue and repeat customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Little data exist on productivity lost due to poor indoor air quality. A survey of 94 state government office buildings
attributes an average productivity loss of 14 minutes per day or 3.0 percent to poor indoor air quality [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H2].
Based on information gathered from published resources, the National Energy Management Institute estimates that
there is an increase in productivity of 3.5 percent or approximately 15 minutes per day for employees in a building
that starts as an unhealthy building, and after IAQ improvements, becomes a healthy building [Ex. 4&hyph;240]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To monetize the productivity improvements resulting from implementation of the proposed IAQ standard, OSHA multiplied
the average employee payroll by 3.0 percent. As shown in Table VI&hyph;7, monetized productivity improvements is
estimated at an annual $15 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests any studies relating to productivity effects relevant to the proposal be submitted.

(b) Property Damage, Maintenance and Cleaning Costs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 High concentrations of contaminants in indoor air can have adverse effects on materials and equipment. Damages may
include corrosion of electronic components and electrical current leakage, which may eventually result in equipment
malfunction. The costs of materials and equipment damage by indoor air pollutants include maintenance, repair,
and/or replacement costs resulting from (1) soiling or deterioration of a materials's appearance, or (2) reduced
service life for corroded or degraded appliances, furnishings, and equipment [Ex. 3&hyph;1075H2]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bell Communications Research reported that the seven regional telephone companies have spent large sums ranging
from $10,000 to $380,000 per event to replace, clean and repair switches and other electronic equipment malfunctioning
as a result of indoor air contaminants.

Microbial contamination can cause significant damage to buildings and equipment and there is anecdotal evidence
that damage can be so severe as to make a building unfit for human occupation. OSHA requests comment on the explicit
or implicit rental value affected in buildings with such problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No quantitative estimates are available on the effects of indoor air on equipment. OSHA requests more information
on the effects of indoor air on materials and equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indoor air pollutants and in particular ETS contribute to increased maintenance and cleaning expenses. Increased
maintenance and cleaning costs include: the need to paint walls more frequently, need to clean, repair and replace
furniture, upholstery, carpeting and curtains or drapes that have cigarette burns and or odors; the need to wash windows,
showcases, and other surfaces that attract ash and dust; and the need to clean ashtrays. A survey of 2,000 companies
that had adopted no-smoking policies found that 60 percent of these companies were able to reduce their cleaning and
maintenance costs. The savings have been estimated at about $500 per smoker per year (3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If establishments decide to ban smoking in the workplace, the proposed standard would result in virtually eliminating
all smoking related fires, fire fatalities and injuries and direct property damage. Smoking is a leading cause of
fire related fatalities. During the 1980's, the National Fire Protection Association reports that smoking materials
were the cause of over 200,000 fires per year. This resulted in more than 1,000 civilian fatalities and 3,000 civilian
injuries and approximately $300 million in direct property damage. During the period of 1989 to 1990, there was an
average of $115 million in direct property damage due to non-residential smoking related fires which resulted in
36 fatalities and 3,212 injuries. OSHA will further investigate this issue and requests available data from the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This section presents OSHA's preliminary compliance cost estimates for the proposed standard on indoor air quality.
The cost analysis covers the major proposed provisions for which data are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA requests more information on the consideration for the relationship of employers and facility owners. The decision
to implement any IAQ improvements will be greatly influenced by the relationship between employers and landlords.
Since changes in building ventilation systems will be made by landlords, employers may have to negotiate agreements
to ensure that they can meet the OSHA standard. On the requirement for ETS, landlords in turn are likely to pressure
employers to ban smoking; thereby, forestalling any need for construction of designated smoking rooms. This section
also examines the technological feasibility of complying with proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Technological Feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As interpreted in the Benzene and Cotton Dust cases, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 requires that the
Agency, with regard to exposure to toxic substances, is to reduce significant risk of material health impairment
to the extent feasible. Accordingly, as part of the investigation of the potential effects of the OSHA proposal, OSHA
has examined both the technological and economic feasibility of the proposal. The economic feasibility assessment
appears later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA's assessment of the technological feasibility is based on an examination of what would be required to comply
with the proposal, along with a review of existing practices among affected establishments. With regard to this proposal,
problems with technological feasibility, by and large, are not evident. Employers are required to operate their
HVAC systems within those parameters originally designated for the equipment. While many employers may choose to
provide separately ventilated smoking areas, this is an option, not a requirement, under the proposed regulation.
This technology is widespread currently and can be used to achieve compliance with the proposed standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in some situations, such as hotels and prisons, employees have as their workplace the residence of others
who live in that building. Restaurants, bars and other ``public'' places expose employees to customer's tobacco
smoke. While it is technologically feasible to ban smoking in those establishments, there may be other problems,
legal and economic. While it is theoretically possible to minimize employee exposure to ETS in such a work environment
through special ventilation, in the absence of modified customer service arrangements, actually eliminating worker
exposure to ETS would likely prove difficult. Consequently, the selection process for one of the smoking policy alternatives
for a particular workplace must consider both the physical limitations of the building or firm and the building's
use. In addition, some employers may be using their building facilities for purposes for which the original design
did not intend, and for which retrofitting might prove difficult. OSHA requests comment on those workplaces for which
compliance with the proposed standard would prove technologically challenging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA will consider additional information on the ability of firms to implement IAQ programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Compliance Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
OSHA estimated preliminary costs of complying with the proposed standard. OSHA's cost assumptions and methodologies
are based on information available from the rulemaking record. Further detailed industry analysis will be developed
by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table VI&hyph;8 contains OSHA's estimates of the annualized first-year and the annual recurring costs of full compliance
with the proposed rule. The annualized first-year cost of compliance is $1.4 billion. The cost for eliminating exposure
to ETS may range from $0 to $68 million depending on whether establishments shall ban smoking or allow smoking in designated
areas. OSHA estimated that the annual cost of compliance with the IAQ standard will be $8.1 billion, of which the most
costly provision will be for the building systems operation and maintenance, $8.0 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA developed cost estimates for the affected industries using the following categories of information: (1) Provisions
of the proposed standard requiring activities; (2) the number of potentially affected buildings, establishments
and employees; (3) the percentage of establishments or buildings in each industry currently in compliance with each
proposed requirement; and (4) the unit costs for bringing establishments into compliance with the various provisions
of the proposed standard. These four items were combined to produce OSHA's estimated costs of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs were estimated on an annual basis, with total annual costs calculated as the sum of annualized initial costs
and annual recurring costs. All capital costs and non-recurring first year costs were annualized over the service
life of the equipment or administrative activity, at a discount rate of 10 percent.

 and maintenance. The plan should provide an overview of the building and system, using a short text description and
single-line schematics or as-built construction documents. The operations information would also describe how
to operate the HVAC systems so that it performs with the reported design criteria. In addition, the operations information
should include: (1) Special procedures like seasonal start-ups and shutdowns, and (2) a list of operating performance
criteria such as minimum outside air ventilation rates, potable hot water storage and delivery temperatures, range
of space relative humidities and any space pressurization requirements, (3) an evaluation of the need to retrofit
the HVAC system when the design occupancy levels are exceeded, and (4) a checklist for visual inspection of building
systems.

The maintenance written plan will also include a description of the equipment to be maintained and the recommended
maintenance procedures and frequency of performance. Preferably, the plan should contain the equipment maintenance
manuals issued upon completion of facility construction. For establishments in buildings with natural ventilation,
employers will develop a plan to assure that windows, doors, vents, stacks and other portals designed or used for natural
ventilation are in operable condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost associated with compiling such information will vary depending on the size of the establishment building,
the complexity of the building system, the extent to which such information is already available, and type of occupancy
(e.g., single establishment or multi-establishment). In some cases some establishments especially the large ones
may already have developed such information. For example, in 1986, IBM initiated a program by first evaluating building
design, operation and maintenance and as a result, an IAQ program was devised to include: a model operation/maintenance
and IAQ awareness program for building operation/maintenance personnel, an updated building commissioning document
and appropriate building lease and contracted operation/maintenance agreements [Ex. 3&hyph;904]. There are no
data on the number of establishments with IAQ programs. Based on information in the docket, OSHA assumed that 95 percent
of all establishments are required to develop the IAQ compliance program information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, employers are required to: (1) identify a designated person who is given the responsibility of the IAQ

(b) IAQ Operation and Maintenance Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard requires maintenance and inspection of the building system components that directly affect
IAQ. Specifically, the HVAC system should provide at least the outside air ventilation rate based on actual occupancy,
building code, mechanical code or ventilation code and that carbon dioxide concentration does not exceed 800 parts
per million. In approximately 500 indoor air quality investigations, NIOSH found that the primary cause of indoor
air quality problems is inadequate ventilation (52 percent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other actions required include: (1) Control of humidity in buildings with mechanical cooling systems, (2) implementing
the use of general or local exhaust ventilation where maintenance and housekeeping activities involve use of equipment
or products which emit air contaminants in other areas of the facility, (3) maintain mechanical equipment rooms and
any non-ducted air plenums or chases in a clean condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that not every building will have to make all recommended changes to improve operation and maintenance
of the HVAC system. In the majority of the cases, some improvements can be accomplished by changing the setting on a
control device or centralized control system. Depending on the condition of the HVAC equipment, inspection and maintenance
may include simple housekeeping of equipment and air transport pathways and/or catastrophic failure maintenance
to repair/replace failed equipment. Also, there may be cases where a number of buildings will require major changes
in the HVAC system such as enlarging the size of the outside air intake.

The cost for providing maintenance first requires an estimate of the number of buildings without regular HVAC maintenance.
The 1989 Commercial Buildings Characteristics survey by the Department of Energy estimates that 46 percent of the
buildings have regular HVAC maintenance. Therefore, the total number of buildings requiring maintenance is estimated
at 2.3 million. OSHA then determined the number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance by applying the OSHA
estimate of 30 percent (presented in section B). The number of problem buildings without HVAC maintenance is estimated
at 0.7 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the average cost per year to maintain a commercial HVAC system is a function of a number of factors. These
factors include the type of system, the age of the system, the size of the system, layout of the system, reliability
of the equipment installed. In addition to the physical characteristics of the system, the cost per year to maintain
the system also depends on the operation of the system, the maintenance policies of the owner, the skill levels of the
operating engineers and maintenance workers, and whether the maintenance is carried out by employees of the building
owner or is the responsibility of an outside company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bank of America's maintenance costs for its 2,000 worksites averaged $4 million per year or an average of $2,000 per
worksite [Ex. 3&hyph;552]. One facility, a high-rise office building, reported an annual cost of approximately
$0.6 million [Ex. 3&hyph;448]. DOW Chemical Company's estimate for ventilation systems maintenance ranges from
$0.17 to $0.25/sq.ft/yr [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. Therefore, OSHA used an average of $0.21/sq.ft/yr to compute the cost
of HVAC maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to regular HVAC maintenance, buildings with known IAQ problems will require other improvements such
as (1) relocating air intakes and other pathways of building entry to restrict the entry of outdoor air contaminants,
or (2) installing local source capture exhaust ventilation or substitution within workspaces where air contaminants
are being emitted, or (3) increasing ventilation effectiveness, or (4) reduce unwanted infiltration, or (5) monitor
outside air quantity to meet ventilation requirements. The National Energy Management Institute developed a cost
model for implementing IAQ improvements which is based on the distribution of buildings with IAQ problems by climate
zone, building activity and size, and characteristics of ventilation systems. The average cost to implement the
actions listed above are estimated to be $1.14 per square foot. These improvements will only be required for the initial
year.

Non-recurring first year costs were annualized over 20 years at 10 percent interest rate. As presented in Table VI&hyph;10,
the annualized first-year cost is estimated at $1.3 billion. OSHA anticipates total annual costs of $8.0 billion.

(c) Training for HVAC Maintenance Workers and Informing Employees About the Indoor Air Quality Standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standard requires training for all building maintenance workers involved in building system operation
and maintenance. Standards of maintenance vary dramatically in the HVAC industry and sometimes are deficient where
untrained personnel are designated to maintain very complex systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training programs for workers must include at least information on: (1) How to maintain adequate ventilation of air
contaminants generated during building cleaning and maintenance, and (2) how to minimize adverse effects on indoor
air quality during the use and disposal of chemicals and other agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exact cost of training will vary among establishments depending on whether employees are trained in-house or
sent to outside training programs or consultants. OSHA estimated the costs for the trainer who must research, prepare
and direct the sessions. For the time involved in the training session, a range of costs for the instructor could be
developed. For example, the wage costs for the trainer could represent from 50 percent of the trainee labor costs (if
there are only two in the class) to 5 percent if there are 20 trainees in a class. For the preparation time, OSHA judged
that the trainer will require a special study seminar, such as that taught by the Building Owners and Managers Association
International.

The total cost of training is estimated at $6.84 per maintenance worker for a half hour program. Table VI&hyph;11,
presents OSHA's estimate for the number of maintenance workers needing training and the associated costs. The annualized
first year cost is estimated at $0.5 million. It was assumed that job changes within establishments or buildings will
require retraining. The annual new hire cost is estimated at $0.8 million, based upon industry turnover rates. Thus
OSHA estimated annualized cost training to be $1.3 million. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed standard requires employers to inform all employees of the contents of the standard and its appendices.
This could be accomplished by posting the proposed standard at a bulletin board; therefore, OSHA did not include a
cost for this provision.

(d) Compliance with Related Standards.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed standard requires employees performing work on HVAC systems to comply with several existing OSHA standards
and therefore any costs associated with compliance with this provision have already been considered. This requirement
is necessary to protect employees from exposure to indoor air pollutants and exposure to noise. This provision is
considered to have a de minimus effect on all industries and OSHA believes that establishments are in full compliance
with this requirement.

(e) Air Contaminant-Environmental Tobacco Smoke.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The primary objective of the tobacco smoke provision is to eliminate the nonsmoker's exposure to ETS. Under the proposed
rule, firms will have the option of either banning smoking of tobacco products or permitting smoking only in designated
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recognizes that not all establishments will make available designated smoking areas as there may be physical
constraints on the option of providing separate ventilation. Such constraints are imposed by the building's design,
the building's mechanical ventilation system's capabilities, by costs involved in providing adequate ventilation,
by the occupant use of the building. In some cases, establishments located in severe climate zones may find it necessary
to protect their smoking employees from weather exposure by providing designated smoking areas.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Establishments in large high rise buildings may also find it desirable to provide such rooms to facilitate break periods.
Consequently, in order to reflect the degree to which establishments will provide separate smoking areas, OSHA developed
some estimates based on the characteristics of the stock of buildings and the percentage of companies currently banning
smoking in the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has no data on the number of establishments currently permitting smoking in designated smoking areas. OSHA estimated
that 50 percent of large establishments with floor space greater than 100,000 square feet and with more than three
floors will provide designated smoking areas. OSHA also assumed that 50 percent of all eating and drinking places
and hotels and other lodging places may provide separate designated smoking areas. For these establishments, OSHA
then applied the percentage of companies that will ban smoking based on the rates provided from a survey conducted
by the Administrative Management Society Foundation (AMS) on current practices for smoking policies in the workplace.
According to the survey, 25 percent of the companies completely ban smoking on their premises. However, the percentages
varied by SIC as follows: manufacturing (23%), transportation and utilities (36%), banking and finance (28%), insurance
(38%), retail and wholesale (7%), and services (18%). Also, 72 percent felt that smoking in the workplace should be
either banned or restricted [H&hyph;030_Ex. 75]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Firms opting to make available designated smoking areas are expected to incur initial capital costs. OSHA assumed
that in many cases existing rooms or offices can be converted into a designated smoking area. Average cost estimates
for retrofitting the HVAC system ranges from $4,000 for a 150 square feet room (which could accommodate up to 10 smokers)
[Ex. 4&hyph;265] to $25,000 for 1,000 square feet (which could accommodate 30 to 65 smokers) [Ex. 3&hyph;643]. The
HVAC retrofit represented in these estimates typically includes: (1) blocking off the return air inlet from the room,
(2) providing a transfer air path, and (3) providing an exhaust fan and exhaust air pathway to the outside. The exhaust
fan capacity would exceed air supplied to the room in sufficient quantity to create a negative pressure in the smoking
room relative to surrounding areas to ensure containment of the contaminant. In order to achieve negative pressure
some architectural modifications may be necessary to provide a tight enclosure. OSHA did not estimate an additional
cost for housekeeping since such activities would have been performed prior to the promulgation of the proposed standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Most facilities exhaust air from toilet rooms and also relieve air brought in for ventilation and economizer cooling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10(a)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The amount of exhaust air from a designated smoking area is inconsequential compared with the quantities of air leaving
the building through toilet room exhaust and relief. Therefore, OSHA did not include recurring cost for the provision
of a separately ventilated smoking area.

(f) Air Quality during Renovation and Remodeling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed standard requires that during renovation and remodeling appropriate controls are utilized to minimize
degradation of the indoor air quality of employees performing such activities and employees in other areas of the
building. The basic characteristics of available control practices include: ventilation system/high efficiency
particulate air (HEPA) vacuum; regulated areas, isolation or containment of work areas and appropriate negative
pressure containment; outside air intakes, return/recirculation air streams or plenums; notification of employees
and contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For buildings with asbestos presence, the control practices under the OSHA asbestos standard are current industry
practice. A survey developed for obtaining information on practices to control exposure to asbestos in buildings
shows that asbestos-related work represents 16 percent of renovation activities whereas general remodeling is
61 percent and major repair and maintenance are 12 percent [Ex. 4&hyph;64].

More than half of the buildings sampled were occupied during renovation activities. However, all projects in which
asbestos-related work was being performed were sealed off from the building occupants. A variety of renovation projects
were performed in buildings ranging in project area from 15 to 900,000 square feet, in duration from one to 156 weeks
and in cost from $700 to more than $10 million. The average cost was approximately $0.3 million and the average duration
for a project was 13 weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, no data are available on the cost to provide controls required under the proposed IAQ standard or for current
industry compliance for chemical exposure other than exposure to asbestos. OSHA assumed minimal cost due to the nature
of these processes.

F. Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The previous section presented the costs to all industries of complying with the proposed standard. This chapter
examines projected economic and environmental impacts on those industries. OSHA developed quantitative estimates
of the economic impact of the proposed standard on the affected industries. Data on profits are presented to illustrate
the scale of profitability of affected industries and do not necessarily represent their ability to pay for proposed
standard provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA assessed the potential economic impacts and has preliminarily determined that the standard is economically
feasible for each of the major industry groups that will be affected. OSHA conducted its analysis at the two digit SIC
level. This has been OSHA's procedure for doing regulatory impact analyses for other proposed standards. OSHA preliminarily
concludes that this is reflective of the actual impact on the average firm within each subsector. It does not appear
that the affected groups will experience significant adverse economic impact as a result of the standard. However,
if any interested person has information to show that the analysis at the two digit level is not representative of the
potential economic impact of the proposal, OSHA requests the following information: Reasons why the preliminary
regulatory analysis is not reflective of the actual anticipated costs in any particular sector; specific information
as to why the analysis at the two digit level fails to adequately represent the economic impact; and specific information
to help OSHA to better predict the impact on the sector in question. Such information should be included in the comments
on the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, OSHA additionally examined the potential for an unduly
burdensome impact on small entities. OSHA believes that the standard will not have significant adverse effect on
a substantial number of small entities. However, OSHA requests comment on those workplaces for which compliance
with the proposed standard would prove economically and technologically challenging (e.g., restaurants, bars
and other ``public'' places where employees are exposed to customer's tobacco smoke). While it is technologically
feasible to ban smoking in those establishments, there may be other countervailing problems, legal and economic,
which OSHA should consider.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In order to determine the economic feasibility of the rule, OSHA compared estimated compliance costs with: (1) The
value of sales and (2) before-tax profits. All financial data developed for this analysis are based on information
from Dun and Bradstreet's annual credit survey. Aggregate sales data for 1991 were taken from the D&amp;B Market Identifiers
data base [Exs. 4&hyph;94, 4&hyph;95, 4&hyph;96]. Mean profit rates (profit as a percentage of sales) were taken
from D&amp;B's Insight data base; OSHA averaged data for 1990, 1991 and 1992.

Using a conversion formula
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 based on the federal corporate tax schedule, OSHA calculated pre-tax profits from its estimate for post-tax profits.
It should be noted that the sales and profit data, while the most recent available, reflect conditions during a cyclical
trough; therefore, impacts may depict a worst case scenario. In the case of the federal government sector, price increases
for services rendered may not apply. Budgets are usually fixed (in the short run) and compliance costs are paid by reducing
funds for other items in the budget.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This conversion implicitly assumes individual business establishments are separate corporations. Because more
than one establishment may be grouped together for tax purposes, the conversion will tend to underestimate pre-tax
profits. State, local and other business taxes have not been factored into the conversion formula. Additionally,
because average tax rates may decline as pre-tax profits decline, the after-tax impact to the company may be less than
suggested here.

Where industry enjoys an inelastic demand for its product, an increase in operating costs can ordinarily be passed
on to consumers. In this case, the maximum expected price increase is calculated by dividing the estimated compliance
cost for each industry by the sales for that industry. Table VI&hyph;13 shows that the average price increase related
to the cost of this proposed standard would be extremely small, 0.07 percent, with the largest being 0.41 percent (Personal
Services, SIC&hyph;72). The results in Table VI&hyph;13 indicate that even if all costs were passed on to consumers
through price increases, the rule would have a negligible impact on prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many industries, however, establishments will not be able to pass along the entire cost of compliance through price
increases since consumers may respond by reducing demand. Such establishments will have to absorb from profit the
costs they cannot pass through. If all costs were absorbed from profit, the maximum expected decrease in profit can
be calculated by dividing the estimated compliance cost for each industry by its estimated profit. Table VI&hyph;13
shows that the average decline in profits under this worst-case-elasticity assumption would be less than 0.94 percent.
The largest potential decline in profits would be in Fishing at 4.5 percent (SIC&hyph;9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because most establishments will not find it necessary to absorb all of the costs from profits and will be able to pass
some of the costs on to consumers, average profits will not decline to the extent calculated in this analysis.

OSHA believes that these impacts are not large enough to impair economic viability. While some marginal firms might
be more seriously impacted, extensive economic dislocation is not expected to occur in any industry. OSHA has, therefore,
preliminarily determined that the standard is economically feasible.

(2) Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed IAQ standard will affect numerous small establishments and a portion of these establishments may have
difficulty financing the compliance actions needed to comply depending on which alternative they choose. This section
examines the potential for exceptional impacts among small establishments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of compliance action limits the potential for exceptionally large compliance burdens on small businesses
because most costs will be incurred on a per employee or per square foot basis. The number of buildings occupied with
establishments with fewer than 20 employees is estimated at 3.7 million or 82 percent of all buildings. Of these, 76
percent have floor space less than 10,000 square feet. Thus, small firms will incur low costs because they have small
floorspace and few employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this point of the analysis, OSHA has not distributed the number of buildings across establishments since there
are no data on which to describe the establishments in multi-tenant buildings. Therefore, OSHA developed establishment
specific compliance costs based on the estimates presented in section E of this report. The economic impact by firm
size is estimated with the assumption that all establishments will require HVAC maintenance. It was assumed that
each establishment has a floor space of 10,000 square feet. To examine the potential regulatory burden that would
be experienced by small establishments, OSHA calculated the ratio of their annual compliance cost to their sales
and pre-tax profit for two scenarios for dealing with ETS: (1) provide designated smoking areas, or (2) totally ban
smoking in the workplace. As shown in Table VI&hyph;14, for both scenarios, the average ratio of compliance costs
to sales ranges from 0.44 percent to 0.52 percent. The highest impact (2.79 percent) for establishments not banning
smoking would be in Personal Services (SIC&hyph;72). Estimates of compliance cost as a percentage of pre-tax profits
were less than 7.05 percent for most sectors; Social Services establishments (SIC&hyph;83) would experience the
largest reduction in profit (31 percent), if they allow smoking in designated rooms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates apply to the average firm in each sector. The degree to which affected firms will either incur or shift
compliance costs depends largely on the competitive environment in which the establishments operate and on the elasticity
of demand for the establishment's services and commodities. OSHA requests information regarding compliance costs
against indicators of the demand for and the costs of the types of services and commodities provided by establishments
which would be affected by the proposed standard. OSHA specifically requests comments, including empirical data
regarding the demand elasticity of such establishments' patrons who will not be permitted to smoke in the presence
of employees at such establishments. If economic feasibility is shown to be an issue for establishments such as bars
and restaurants, what methods of compliance would adequately protect workers in a feasible manner?

The provisions of the standard have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 432, et seq.], the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations [40
CFR Part 1500], and OSHA's DOL NEPA Procedures [29 CFR Part 11]. As a result of this review, OSHA concluded that this
rule will have no significant environmental impact.

VII. Summary and Explanation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements set forth in this notice are those which, based on currently available data, OSHA believes are necessary
and appropriate to control conditions which may degrade indoor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air and pose a significant risk of material impairment to employees in their work environments. The Agency considers
that a broad approach to the control of IAQ problems, as proposed in this notice, will most effectively lead to a reduction
in associated risk to employees [Exs. 3&hyph;2, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;37, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;239, 3&hyph;287, 3&hyph;434,
3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502]. OSHA has considered all data submitted in response to the Request for Information, as well
as other scientific data which has been made a part of the record in this proceeding in arriving at these proposed provisions
regarding regulation of indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following sections provide a summary of each provision of the proposal and a statement of their intent and purpose.
Exhibit numbers included in this Summary and Explanation are citations to supporting comments and data submitted
to the record in response to the RFI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicits data, views, and comments on all provisions proposed in this notice. OSHA is interested in whether
or not the proposed provisions are necessary, appropriate, and adequate to achieve the goals of the standard and why.
Interested persons should also comment on whether or not the proposed provisions are technologically and economically
feasible and why, and whether additional or alternative provisions addressing indoor air quality should be included
in the standard and why.

Scope and Application: Paragraph (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA is proposing that these standards cover all employees under its jurisdiction, including employees in general
industry, shipyards, longshoring, marine terminals, construction, and agriculture. To accomplish this, OSHA
is proposing to publish an identical complete standard for general industry at 29 CFR 1910.1033, for shipyards at
29 CFR 1915.1033, and for construction at 29 CFR 1926.1133. OSHA is proposing to amend section 1910.19 to make it clear
that &sect;1910.1033 is a Subpart Z standard which is incorporated by cross reference into 29 CFR parts 1917 and 1018
for longshoring and marine terminals. OSHA is proposing to amend 29 CFR 1928.21 to indicate that 1910.1033 will be
applicable to agriculture. OSHA requests comments on the scope of the proposal and the formal manner by which the standard
would be incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(1) proposes to apply all provisions of the standard to ``nonindustrial work environments.'' In addition,
paragraph (a)(2) proposes to further extend coverage of the provisions found in paragraph (e)(1), which address
exposure to tobacco smoke, to all indoor work environments under OSHA's jurisdiction. This includes indoor work
areas on construction sites, shipyards, and agricultural employments. The Agency believes that application of
the proposed provisions under paragraph (e)(1) addressing exposure to tobacco smoke is necessary, appropriate,
and feasible for any indoor or enclosed workplace covered by OSHA. Compliance with the tobacco smoke provisions essentially
entails establishment of a separate enclosure, exhausted directly to the outside, and maintained under negative
pressure where smoking is permitted. OSHA sees no feasibility obstacles in application of these provisions to industrial
as well as nonindustrial work environments. It is not clear to OSHA, however, that the other indoor air quality provisions
of the proposed standard can be feasibly or appropriately applied in typical industrial work environments. These
provisions primarily address means to assure effective functioning of HVAC systems and actions felt necessary to
be taken to maintain good general indoor air quality. Thus, it may not be feasible or appropriate to apply these provisions
to industrial ventilation systems or industrial environments in which control of various industrial contaminant
emissions rather than general air quality is the primary issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definitions: Paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms are defined for the purpose of this proposal: ``Air Contaminants'', ``Assistant Secretary'',
``Building systems'', ``Building-related illness'', ``Designated person'', ``Designated smoking area'', ``Director'',
``Employer'', ``HVAC system'', ``Non-industrial work environment'', and ``Renovation and remodeling''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Air contaminants'' refers to substances contained in the vapors from paint, cleaning chemicals, pesticides,
solvents, particulates, outdoor air pollutants and other airborne substances which may cause material impairment
to the health of employees working within the nonindustrial environment. The term ``air contaminants'' informs
the employer that the provisions addressing control of air contaminants apply to airborne substances which may be
within nonindustrial indoor work environments. For purposes of this proposal the definition of air contaminants
may be broader than that used in 29 CFR 1910.1000. Hazardous levels of air contaminants may arise from contaminant
buildup due to inefficient or insufficient general dilution ventilation with outside air, the misapplication of
general dilution ventilation to address strong point sources, indoor activities or operations such as renovation,
remodeling, maintenance, etc. which lead to local source emissions, and entry of outdoor contaminants such as vehicle
exhausts, wastes, stored materials, or pollutants from adjacent industrial facilities. Provisions are proposed
in the standard which require the employer to take measures to address the avenues of contaminant buildup noted above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S.
Department of Labor, or designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Building systems'' applies to the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, the potable
water system, the energy management system, and all other systems in a facility which may impact indoor air quality.
This broad definition was necessary to avoid excluding non-HVAC systems which do impact indoor air quality. In the
facilities industry, potable hot water systems are typically considered plumbing systems and not HVAC systems.
Plumbing systems (potable hot water) have been implicated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legionella 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
episodes where the water is aerosolized, so excluding plumbing systems from the scope of this standard would have
been unacceptable. This definition also intends to focus operation and maintenance efforts on those systems whose
failure, degradation, or misuse would adversely impact indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Building-related illness'' describes specific medical conditions of known etiology which can be documented
by physical signs and laboratory findings. Such illnesses include sensory irritations when caused by known agents,
respiratory allergies, nosocomial infections, asthma, humidifier fever, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Legionnaires'
disease, and the symptoms and signs characteristic of exposure to chemical or biologic substances such as carbon
monoxide, formaldehyde, chlordane, endotoxins, or mycotoxins. ``Building-related illness'' defines the medical
conditions that, if observed, require evaluation of the facility building systems to determine if they are functioning
properly, and the taking of remedial action where warranted. Building-related illnesses are often potentially
severe and are often traceable to a specific contaminant source such as ETS, microbial growth, and a host of other chemical
or biologic substances which must be attended to mitigate degradation of indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Designated person'' means a person who has been given the responsibility by the employer to take necessary
measures to assure compliance with this section and who is knowledgeable in the requirements of this standard and
the specific HVAC system servicing the affected building or office. As noted above a ``Designated person'' must be
knowledgeable in HVAC system functioning. Provisions in the standard propose to require the ``Designated person''
to oversee the establishment and implementation of the IAQ compliance program, and oversee building systems inspection
and maintenance activities, thus this person must have technical expertise in those areas. OSHA believes that there
is a need for central responsibility in affected buildings and facilities [Exs. 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444b, 3&hyph;507].
Of course OSHA recognizes that in certain circumstances the ``Designated person'' may merely supervise or coordinate
the activities of outside contractors or shift-workers who have responsibility for maintaining parts of the building
systems. Building systems and other factors affecting indoor air quality are sufficiently complex and unique to
suggest the necessity of appointing a designated person who is on site to act on the employers behalf in this regard.
For example, multiple employers may be engaging in different activities within a facility that affect building system
functioning or air quality and actions by one employer may subject employees of other employers to environmental
hazards. Fragmentation of responsibility and lack of communication has been observed by OSHA in the nonindustrial
workplace. For example, when responding to an indoor air quality/building-related illness complaint, the OSHA
Compliance Officer may need to gather information from a number of responsible facility groups like tenant leasing,
facilities engineering, housekeeping, maintenance, operations, and energy management. These diverse groups
may have little or no central authority and direction especially if they are outside contractors. The designated
person would be in a position to mitigate the consequences of such diversity by being aware and responsible for the
overall environmental conditions in the building or facility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other OSHA health standards have adopted similar requirements with respect to those proposed in this Notice regarding
the designated person. For example, final standards for chromium (57 FR 42102) and lead (58 FR 26590) require that
a technically knowledgeable ``competent person'' be on site during construction activities, which often involve
multiple employers. OSHA concluded in those standards that designating a person to act on the employers' behalf to
ensure compliance with various provisions of those standards, was necessary because of the need for continual site
characterization and analysis to identify the hazards present and the types of control measures and remedial actions
that are effective. For these same reasons, OSHA proposes requirements for designated persons under this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Designated smoking area'' means a room in which smoking of tobacco products is permitted. The Agency believes
that establishment of ``designated smoking areas'' is necessary to prevent employee exposure to ETS in workplaces
where smoking is not prohibited. Provisions are included in this proposal addressing design, construction and operation
of such areas to meet this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Director'' means the Director, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, or designee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Employer'' means all persons defined as employers by section 3(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health
Act of 1970 including employers (such as building owners or lessees) who control the ventilation or maintenance of
premises where employees of other employers work. For purposes of the proposal, an employer is also defined as a person
who exercises control over the ventilation systems in the workplace. Control over the ventilation systems is a multi-faceted
concept: it includes maintenance, recordkeeping and the development and implementation of the indoor air quality
compliance plan. While responsibility for various aspects of the ventilation system encompasses many duties, the
proposal does not necessarily contemplate that all of the duties will be performed by the same person. The proposal
is flexible in that regard and responsibility for the various aspects can be shared by various persons depending on
the circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many instances the employer will either be the owner of the building where the workplace is located or will be a long
term lessee, responsible under the lease for the care and maintenance of the property. In these cases, the owner/employer
would take care of the ventilation system by designating knowledgeable persons within his employ to the necessary
tasks or by hiring competent contractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In other cases, there will be a number of different businesses all located in separate leased space within the same
building. In these instances the various employer/lessees would probably share responsibility for compliance
with the proposed standard. For example, each individual lessee might be obligated to provide the building owner
with a description of the work activity planned for within its particular leased space, including the number of employees
or visitors expected, the hours of work operation and any situations where air contaminants may be released into the
workplace air. Air contaminants might reasonably be expected to be released into the workplace air as a result of the
installation of new furniture or wall coverings, any painting or remodeling scheduled to take place or any pest extermination
activity within the premises. Each employer would, of course, be responsible for reporting to whoever is in charge
of the ventilation system, any employee complaints or signs or symptoms that may be related to building-related illness.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The building owners or whoever is in charge of the maintenance of the ventilation system would be in a position to develop
standard operating procedures for the building systems as well as special procedures for emergencies and maintenance.
In addition such a person would be in a position to know or develop an appropriate maintenance schedule and to gather
relevant documents to assist in the care and maintenance of the ventilation system, such as diagrams of the system,
manufacturers manuals, and inspection guidelines and schedules for the proper maintenance of such systems. The
same person might also be responsible for maintaining and operating the HVAC system to provide the required air ventilation
rate and desired relative humidity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal is designed in this performance oriented manner to afford affected employers the flexibility to assure
the establishment and maintenance of a system to provide healthful indoor air quality in the most sensible and efficient
way possible considering their particular circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Act gives the Secretary the right to promulgate standards to assure employees
safe and healthful working conditions. Employers must comply with the standards which the Secretary promulgates.
The Act defines an employer expansively as a person with employees in a business affecting interstate commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the proposal as written will protect employees from the risks of poor indoor air quality.
Where the owner of a business is not the owner of the space where such business operates, the owner or landlord of the
building will probably also be an employer within the meaning of the Act and the definition contained in this proposal.
This is so because the building owner or operator will generally have employees (either on site or off site) and will
be engaged in a business affecting interstate commerce. In such cases the situation will be construed to be a multi-employer
worksite. Such situations are quite common in the context of construction sites. The Agency does not believe that
there is any reason to treat nonindustrial multi-employer worksites differently from construction multi-employer
worksites for purposes of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA has a long history of enforcing OSHA standards in multi-employer worksites. Nothing in this proposed rule would
change the position that the Agency has taken in cases such as Anning-Johnson (4 OSH Cas. (BNA) 1193, Harvey Workover,
Inc., 7 OSH Cas. (BNA) 1687 and in its Field Operations Manual (CPL 2.45 CH&hyph;1, Chapter V&hyph;9). As a general
matter each employer is responsible for the health and safety of his/her own employees. However, under certain circumstances
an employer may be cited for endangering the safety or health of another employer's employees. In determining who
to hold responsible, OSHA will look at who created the hazard, who controlled the hazard, and whether all reasonable
means were taken to deal with the hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is contemplated that in those cases where there is a multi-employer worksite that the affected employers will divide
up the responsibilities in the manner in which they make the most sense. Those who have information at their disposal
that is required to be kept under the proposal will make use of the information or make it available to whoever will need
that information in the discharge of their duties. For example, the building engineer may have possession of the schematics
of the ventilation system. The engineer would make them available to the person responsible for maintaining the system
as well as the person responsible for developing the IAQ Compliance Plan (if that is not the same person). The proposal
is designed to promote the efficient resolution of indoor air quality problems and will not result in duplicative
efforts. There is nothing in the proposal, for example, that would prevent the building owner (who is an employer within
the meaning of the Act) from gathering the required information from the various lessee/employers in the premises,
developing, and implementing an IAQ Compliance Plan which would be shared with the various employers occupying the
premises. In addition, it may be more efficient for the building owner to develop and maintain the records required
by the proposal, again sharing them with the various employer-tenants. The Agency believes that the co-operative
interrelationships which the performance oriented proposal permits will avoid duplication of compliance activities
even within multi-employer worksites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``HVAC system'' means the collective components of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system
including, but not limited to, filters and frames, cooling coil condensate drip pans and drainage piping, outside
air dampers and actuators, humidifiers, air distribution ductwork, automatic temperature controls, and cooling
towers. This definition also intends to focus on those HVAC system components whose failure, degradation, or misuse
would adversely impact indoor air quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Nonindustrial work environment'' means an indoor or enclosed work space such as, but not limited to, offices,
educational facilities, commercial establishments, and healthcare facilities, and office areas, cafeterias,
and break rooms located in manufacturing or production facilities. Nonindustrial work environments do not include
manufacturing and production facilities, residences, vehicles, and agricultural operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``Renovation and remodeling'' means building modification involving activities that include but are not
limited to: removal or replacement of walls, ceilings, floors, carpet, and components such as moldings, cabinets,
doors, and windows; painting, decorating, demolition, surface refinishing, and removal or cleaning of ventilation
ducts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The terms ``HVAC system'', ``Nonindustrial work environment'', and ``Renovation and remodeling'' are defined
to clarify and illustrate the parameters under which obligations of the standard are incurred. For example, the definition
of ``HVAC system'' lists what OSHA believes to be typical components of such systems which directly affect indoor
air quality. These components are enumerated since provisions under the standard propose to require employers to
perform routine inspection and maintenance on those components. ``Renovation and remodeling'' is defined to inform
the employer of the situations under which the standard proposes to require the employer to take special precautions
when those activities take place.

Indoor Air Quality Compliance Program: Paragraph (c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph proposes to require employers to obtain or develop certain written information that will facilitate
implementation of measures necessary to prevent degradation of indoor air quality. Paragraph (c)(2) proposes to
require the employer to identify a designated person to be given the responsibility of overseeing establishment
and implementation of the written compliance program. Paragraph (c)(3) proposes to require the employer to establish
a written IAQ compliance program to include at least the following information: a description of the facility building
systems; schematics or construction documents locating building systems equipment; information on the daily operation
and management of the building systems; a description of the building and its function; a written maintenance program;
and a checklist for visual inspection of the building systems. Further, paragraph (c)(4) proposes to require that
the following information also must be retained, if available, to assist in indoor air quality evaluations: as built
construction documents; HVAC system commissioning reports; HVAC system testing, adjusting and balancing reports;
operation and maintenance manuals; water treatment logs; and operator training materials. Paragraph (c)(5) proposes
to require the establishment of records of employee complaints of building-related illnesses, as part of the written
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that written plans are an essential element of an overall compliance program since it will encourage
employers to focus on indoor air quality and implement the necessary controls and measures to achieve compliance
with the standard [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;529].
The development of documented safety and health programs and procedures is a well-established and common practice
in industry, and requirements for written programs are typically found in other OSHA standards dealing with exposure
to toxic substances. Written plans provide information to allow OSHA, the employer, and employees to examine the
control methods chosen and evaluate the extent to which these planned controls are being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3) proposes to require the employer to establish written plans for compliance. Specifically, paragraphs
(c)(3)(i), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(3)(iii) propose to require general, descriptive information about: the facility,
building systems, building function and building use patterns. This general building description is believed to
be essential information of a building profile which is necessary for a basic understanding of the building systems
and which is necessary to set the foundation for the operations and maintenance information required in other paragraphs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, in paragraph (c)(3)(iv), OSHA believes that it is necessary to require written information which describes
daily operation and management of the facility building systems which directly affects IAQ. When it comes to operations
and management, organizational fragmentation within nonindustrial buildings may be further exacerbated by the
lack of familiarity with the intent of the original design team whose assumptions and design intent for the HVAC system,
are typically unknown. Over time, building use may differ from original design intent in ways not foreseen by the original
designers. It is not uncommon for spaces to be loaded or used in ways beyond the original design intent which may adversely
impact IAQ, such as putting up walls for private offices, exceeding intended occupant densities, and bringing into
the space new contaminant sources. HVAC system total capacity may be able to handle these changes from original design
loads but little is done to balance the available capacity among the individual zones that may be overused or underused.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the employer may need to communicate design intent and performance criteria to building occupants whose
expectations regarding their environment may exceed what is deliverable by the building systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these issues, OSHA is proposing to require that each facility have written operations and management information
whose aim is twofold. One purpose is to collect, summarize and translate design assumptions and intent into operating
performance criteria that impact IAQ, such as minimum outside air ventilation rates and occupant densities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, the operations information should describe how to operate and manage the building systems so that they
perform in conformance with the reported criteria. This written operations and management information replaces
verbal communications and provides a training document whenever new personnel or new contractors are introduced
to the site. Operating information should formally reflect changes in control strategies that typically occur in
facilities to accommodate change in use or energy conservation efforts. This is an essential element because of the
interdependence between outside air ventilation rate and the automatic temperature control system. In almost all
buildings the performance of the ventilation system is affected by space temperature control needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3)(v) proposes to require a written maintenance program for those building system components that
directly affect IAQ because failure to do so may result in the degradation of IAQ in the facility. A written maintenance
program is believed to be necessary because levels of HVAC system maintenance vary dramatically and sometimes are
deficient where untrained personnel are designated to maintain very complex systems. The following are examples
of maintenance deficiencies which have been associated with IAQ problems: plugged drains on cooling coil condensate
drip pans resulting in microbial contamination of pan; failed exhaust fans in underground parking garages which
allow carbon monoxide to infiltrate into the building above; microbial fouling of cooling tower water from lack of
water treatment with biocides resulting in legionellosis cases; and failure of automatic temperature control system
resulting in lack of outside ventilation air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance of HVAC equipment, for example, may include simple housekeeping of equipment and air transport pathways,
lube and adjustment programs for rotating machinery, and catastrophic failure maintenance to repair/replace failed
equipment. There appears to be consensus among HVAC maintenance personnel that the most successful maintenance
programs, gauged in terms of system performance and life-cycle economics, are proactive rather than reactive. Consequently,
OSHA is promoting preventive maintenance programs for those building system components which affect IAQ. At a minimum,
the maintenance program should describe the equipment to be maintained, establish maintenance procedures and frequency
of performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3)(vi) proposes to require a checklist to guide periodic inspections of building systems. This checklist
should focus on those building system components whose failure, degradation, or misuse would adversely impact indoor
air quality. The checklist shall include but not be limited to inspection of the following components and performance
criteria: fibrous liner used for acoustics and insulation in airhandlers and ducts should be inspected for erosion
and moisture; smoke-trails testing should be performed to verify design pressurization schemes like negative pressure
smoking rooms; ceiling, floor and wall surfaces should be examined for signs of water leaks which could support and
amplify microbial contamination; and outside air louvers, intake paths, dampers, actuators, and linkages should
be checked for obstruction.

Paragraph (c)(5) proposes to require the establishment of records of employee complaints of building-related illnesses
as part of the written program. These records are believed to be necessary to expedite review and evaluation of the
system and to support implementation and operation of an adequate IAQ program [Exs. 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444b, 3&hyph;502].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that effective system operation and maintenance will necessarily rely upon written information
and records such as those relating to design expectations, system capacities, code requirements, maintenance activities
and system evaluations. As with other OSHA rulemakings, the written compliance plan is to be accessible to employees.

Compliance Program Implementation: Paragraph (d) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph proposes to require that the employer take certain actions to maintain acceptable indoor air quality.
These actions primarily address means that OSHA believes necessary to achieve continued adequate and proper functioning
of building systems [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;55, 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;61,
3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;329, 3&hyph;364, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;436, 3&hyph;444A, 3&hyph;479,
3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;501, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;507, 3&hyph;529, 3&hyph;531]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) proposes to require that employers maintain and operate the HVAC system to provide at least the minimum
outdoor air ventilation rate, based on actual occupancy, required by the applicable building code, mechanical code,
or ventilation code in effect at the time the facility was constructed, renovated, or remodelled, whichever was most
recent [Ex. 3&hyph;18]. Paragraph (d)(2) proposes to require employers to conduct building system inspection and
necessary maintenance activities as often as necessary to reduce the likelihood of indoor air quality problems related
to the building systems [Ex. 3&hyph;26]. Further requirements under paragraph (d) are: Assure that the HVAC system
is operable during all work shifts, (d)(3) [Exs. 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;226, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;436]; implement the
use of general or local ventilation where maintenance activities may result in hazardous chemical or particulate
exposures in other areas of the building, (d)(4) [Exs. 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;502]; maintain relative humidity below
60% in buildings with mechanical cooling systems, (d)(5) [Exs. 3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;505B]; during regular
maintenance, as described in subparagraph (d)(1), measure carbon dioxide levels. When they exceed 800 ppm, check
to make sure the HVAC system is operating as it should and correct deficiencies if necessary, (d)(6) [Exs. 3&hyph;10,
3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;214]; assure that buildings without mechanical ventilation are maintained so that windows,
doors, vents, etc., designed or used for natural ventilation are in operable condition, (d)(7); assure that mechanical
equipment rooms and any non-ducted air plenums or chases are maintained in a clean condition, free of hazardous substances,
and asbestos, if friable, is encapsulated or removed so that it does not enter the air distribution system, (d)(8)
[Exs. 3&hyph;29, 3&hyph;500]; assure that inspections and maintenance of the HVAC system are performed by or under
the direction of the designated person, (d)(9) [Ex. 3&hyph;29]; establish a record of HVAC system inspections and
maintenance, (d)(10) [Ex. 3&hyph;26]; assure that employees performing work on HVAC systems are provided with and
use appropriate personal protective equipment, (d)(11) [Ex. 3&hyph;56]; evaluate the need to perform alterations
of the HVAC system in response to employee reports of building-related illness, (d)(12); and take such remedial measures
as the evaluation shows to be necessary, (d)(13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA believes that implementation of each of the actions prescribed in this proposed paragraph are integral elements
in the indoor air quality program. Provisions which address inspection, maintenance, alteration, and operation
of building systems are believed to be essential to ensure successful functioning of system functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(1) proposes to require that employers operate and maintain the HVAC system to provide at least the minimum
outside air ventilation rate. Available evidence in the literature supports this requirement. The literature which
supports the case for ventilation with outside air falls into two categories. One category includes case studies
which are generated when IAQ complaints require on-site responses and the investigators report their findings through
IAQ forums sponsored by professional organizations like the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers, Inc. and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. These studies report that the lack of outside ventilation
air resulting from operational or maintenance deficiencies as one of the causes of IAQ complaints. Many of the studies
include abatement recommendations to ventilate with outside air as feasible per the original design intent. The
second category includes research projects which also support the case for ventilating buildings with at least the
recommended minimum of outside air. Research in the areas of ventilation efficiency, tracer gas analysis, dilution/removal
of internally generated contaminants, and environmental perceptions mostly support this contention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All three major building codes in the United States which are used in the design of new and retrofitted facilities mandate
minimum outside air ventilation rates in mechanically-ventilated buildings. These three code bodies include the
Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), the International Conference of Building
Officials (ICBO), and the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI). Per Section 102 of the 1991
Uniform Building Code as promulgated by the ICBO, the purpose of the building code is ``to offer minimum standards
to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction,
quality of materials, use and occupancy *&blank;*&blank;*''. Clearly, there is a significant commitment of resources
by these code bodies to offer design guidance through the building codes to designers to insure that a facility is capable
of delivering a minimum amount of outside air to its' occupants. This concept is supported by the efforts of plan reviewers
and building inspectors in local governmental jurisdictions throughout the United States who ensure that facilities
are constructed per the building codes. Considering the up-front efforts of these code officials, designers, and
construction teams, it is reasonable from a standpoint of continuity, to require that buildings be operated and maintained
to the same design intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision is not meant to require rebuilding or retrofitting HVAC systems in response to minor work. For example,
such steps would not be required for any renovation work that does not modify the building's configuration or the conditions
that would be affected by the building code applicable at the time the system was installed or last modified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of maintenance, there should be a predictive element which periodically checks the HVAC system to evaluate
conformance with paragraph (d). This check should conform with the proposals of paragraph (d)(2) which requires
an inspection and maintenance of the building systems. This periodic visual inspection is focused by the checklist
outlined in paragraph (c) and targets those components that directly impact indoor air quality. In the field of occupational
safety and health, as practiced by industrial hygienists, it is common practice to perform walk-around inspections.
On the other hand, the HVAC industry often relies heavily on remote sensing to characterize system performance. Therefore,
this required visual inspection will help identify those deficiencies that would otherwise be missed, such as microbial
contamination in cooling coil condensate drip pans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(3) requires that the facility HVAC system is operating during all workshifts. The employer must provide
the minimum outside ventilation rate for contaminant dilution and removal whenever the building is occupied and
used. OSHA understands that the minimum outside air ventilation rate may in practice only be provided when the building
is fully occupied or utilized. It is not uncommon for office buildings to be occupied from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. to accommodate
flexible work schedules but the HVAC system may only be in operation from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. to conserve energy. The technical
rationale for this strategy is typically based on the recommendations of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating
and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE) in their Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable
Indoor Air Quality''. Section 6.1.3.4 and Appendix ``G'' of ASHRAE Standard 62&hyph;1989 [Ex. 4&hyph;333] offers
a rationale for the lead/lag operation of ventilation systems to accommodate transient occupancy. The basis for
the rationale is that there is capacity in air to dilute contaminants if the space has been previously unoccupied for
several hours. This strategy, however, applies only to occupant generated contaminants like carbon dioxide and
odors. Housekeeping cleaning agents or pesticides are typical of contaminants that may be released which could not
be absorbed by a non-ventilated space. Consequently, other contaminants must be diluted/removed by the ventilation
system whenever the building is occupied. In addition, it is recognized that certain automatic temperature control
strategies can also prevent a facility from receiving the minimum outside air ventilation rate. The obvious example
is the early morning warm-up cycle wherein the outside air dampers are kept shut in the morning until the space temperature
recovers from the setback temperature of the night before. These energy conservation and temperature control strategies
must not interfere with providing minimum outside air ventilation when the building is occupied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(4) proposes to require the employer to utilize general or local exhaust ventilation, as provided by
the existing HVAC system or auxiliary systems, to minimize the hazards associated with maintenance or housekeeping
activities. The literature reports IAQ/BRI episodes that were initiated with activities like painting, carpet
cleaning and floor resurfacing. If these activities occur during unoccupied periods then chemical vapors from paints
and adhesives and excessive moisture from carpet cleaning may be diluted and removed by the outside air ventilation
function of the HVAC system. During occupied periods, efforts should be made to restrict transportation of hazardous
contaminants from these activities throughout the facility by the HVAC air distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(5) proposes to require the employer to maintain occupied space relative humidities below 60% in buildings
with mechanical cooling systems. Moisture in a building may support and amplify microbial contamination with potential
for aerosolization. Both the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc.
(ASHRAE) in their Standard 62&hyph;1989 titled ``Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality'', section 5.11
[Ex. 4&hyph;333] and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in their 1989 ``Guidelines
for the Assessment of Bioaerosols in the Indoor Environment'' [Ex. 3&hyph;61] recommend that relative humidity
in the occupied space be maintained below 60%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is inviting comments on whether a relative humidity of 60% is the appropriate upper limit to inhibit microbial
growth or if a higher limit is appropriate. In addition, OSHA would like comment on whether there should be a lower level
of relative humidity as recommended by ASHRAE and ACGIH to reduce irritation effects due to low relative humidity.
And finally, OSHA would like additional comment on whether it is feasible in hot and humid climates to achieve relative
humidities of 60% or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(6) proposes to require the employer to monitor for carbon dioxide (CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the occupied space as part of maintenance or employee complaint investigations. When the concentration exceeds
800 ppm, the employer would be required to check the operation of the HVAC system. CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is frequently used as a gross surrogate indicator of indoor air quality. Ideally, by knowing the rate of accumulation
of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the space and the rate of generation of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by respiring occupants in the space, it would be possible to predict the rate of removal of CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from the space by the HVAC system. Because buildings have average occupant densities to generate CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the concentration is an indicator of the HVAC system's ability to dilute and remove occupant generated contaminants
like CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, water vapor, and odors (human bioeffluents). However, the CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentration and the associated outside air ventilation rate offers no confidence as to the adequacy of dilution
and removal of other contaminants released in the space. If the outside air ventilation rate is insufficient to dilute
and remove CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, then it can be assumed that other contaminant concentrations will also be elevated. The literature reports that
CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in the space under 800 ppm will minimize health-related complaints [Exs. 3&hyph;34A, 4&hyph;331].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(8) proposes to require the employer to restrict the presence of hazardous substances in air distribution
systems. The HVAC air distribution system itself should not be the source of hazardous contaminants due to its' critical
nature as a potential pathway to building occupants. Enclosed ducts are typically not used to store hazardous substances
but non-ducted air transport pathways such as area-ways, plenums, chases, corridors, and mechanical rooms serving
as return air plenums are sometimes used for storage. If these air transport pathways are used for storage, then the
employer must be especially careful to make sure that no spillage or leakage of hazardous substances occurs. This
will insure that the pathways are kept free of hazardous substances.

Paragraph (d)(11) proposes to require that employees working on building systems are provided with and use personal
protective equipment (PPE) as required by other OSHA standards including; 29 CFR 1926, Subpart E, Personal Protective
and Life Saving Equipment; 29 CFR 1926.52, Occupational Noise Exposure; 29 CFR 1910, Subpart I, Personal Protective

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA is aware, through its experience and through the literature and submissions to the docket, that HVAC Operations
and Maintenance (O&amp;M) personnel may often receive minimal training regarding existing relevant OSHA regulations
and the hazards that they are exposed to in the performance of their duties. Sometimes, facilities are not viewed as
industrial workplaces by either the management or employees. However, the hazards do exist and therefore compliance
with existing regulations is necessary to protect the health and safety of O&amp;M employees. Respirators may not
normally be used in this industry due to the perceived lack of a substance-specific hazard. But situations may occur,
for instance, such as chemical or microbial contamination, that would require compliance with 1910.134. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other provisions of this section require; that buildings without mechanical ventilation be operated and maintained
to provide natural ventilation; that inspections and maintenance of building systems be performed by or under the
supervision of the designated person; that the employer establish a written record of building system inspections
and maintenance required under this section; that the employer evaluate the need to perform modifications to the
building systems to meet the minimum requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section in response to employee
complaints of building-related illnesses.

Controls for Specific Contaminant Sources: Paragraph (e) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph proposes to require employers to take specific protective measures to control employee exposure
to specific agents such as tobacco smoke [Exs. 3&hyph;7, 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;291, 3&hyph;305, 3&hyph;409,
3&hyph;449, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;505B], outdoor pollutants [Ex. 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505],
contaminant emissions from local indoor sources [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;412],
microbial contaminants [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505,
3&hyph;506], hazardous chemicals including cleaning and maintenance chemicals and pesticides [Exs. 3&hyph;56,
3&hyph;436, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;505]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to tobacco smoke in workplaces where smoking is not prohibited, paragraph (e)(1) proposes to require
the establishment of designated smoking areas. Such areas must be enclosed and exhausted directly to the outside,
and maintained under negative pressure sufficient to contain tobacco smoke within the designated area. Smoking
is not permitted during cleaning and maintenance work in these designated smoking areas. Moreover, although cleaning
and maintenance are specified in this paragraph, it is OSHA's intent that no work of any kind shall be performed in a
designated smoking area when smoking is taking place. Designated smoking areas must be areas where employees do not
have to enter in the performance of normal work activities. Signs must also be posted at designated smoking areas.
Signs must be posted to inform anyone entering the building that smoking is restricted to designated areas. Finally,
smoking within designated areas is not permitted during any time that the exhaust ventilation system servicing that
area is not operating properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provisions under paragraph (e)(1) addressing control of tobacco smoke are intended to ensure that employees
outside of the designated smoking area will not be exposed to ETS. The Agency anticipates that the provisions as proposed
will accomplish that goal. Enclosing smoking areas, exhausting them to the outside, maintaining them under negative
pressure, and prohibiting smoking in designated areas even when the exhaust system is inoperable are believed to
be necessary and sufficient to prevent tobacco smoke from migrating to other areas of the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designated smoking area must be under negative pressure compared to all surrounding spaces including adjoining
rooms, corridors, plenums and chases. Negative pressure is achieved by exhausting more air from the space than is
supplied to the space.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transfer air must enter the designated smoking room to make-up the volumetric flowrate differential between supply
and exhaust air. It may be necessary to provide a tight architectural enclosure so as to achieve negative pressure
and containment. Leakage through a lay-in ceiling tile system may occur if there is a return air plenum above it. Negative
pressure will induce airflow into the room through the entrance door undercut. Containment may be checked by using
smoke-trails at the door undercut to verify direction of airflow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contaminated exhaust air from a designated smoking room must be transported to the outside through exhaust ducts
under negative pressure to avoid duct leakage into nonsmoking areas that the duct passes through. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions regarding posting of signs are intended to prevent inadvertent entry into smoking areas, and inadvertent
smoking in areas other than designated smoking areas. To prevent involuntary exposure, designated smoking areas
cannot be areas where employees perform normal work activities. For the same reason, smoking is not permitted in smoking
areas during performance of work activities such as cleaning and maintenance of the designated smoking area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision will have special impact on establishments such as bars and restaurants. OSHA invites comments on
feasibility considerations relative to such establishments and suggestions for alternative ways to assure that
nonsmoking workers will not be exposed to tobacco smoke there. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e)(2) establishes requirements dealing with outdoor air pollutants and contaminants emitted
locally within workspaces. This paragraph proposes to require the employer to implement measures to restrict the
entry of outdoor air pollutants into the building and to control local indoor sources of air contaminant emissions
by employing other control measures like substitution or local source capture exhaust ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e)(3) proposes to require the control of microbial contamination by routinely inspecting for
and repairing water leaks that can promote growth of biologic agents, by promptly drying, replacing, removing, or
cleaning damp or wet materials; and by taking measures to remove visible microbial contamination in ductwork, humidifiers,
other HVAC system components, or on other building surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (e)(4) addresses the use of cleaning and maintenance chemicals, pesticides and other hazardous
chemicals. Pesticides must be used according to manufacturers' recommendations, and where chemicals are to be used,
employees in those areas affected are to be informed, at least within 24 hours prior to use, of the type of chemical to
be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions proposed under (e)(2) are intended to ensure that indoor air quality is not degraded as a result of entry
of outdoor contaminants, such as vehicle exhaust, or by circulation of contaminants generated within the building.
The Agency believes that, where necessary, entry of outdoor air pollutants can be restricted by eliminating or repositioning
entry points into the building. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indoor local contaminant emissions can be minimized where necessary, through application of control measures such
as source substitution and engineering controls that may include local source capture exhaust ventilation. Collection
of contaminants at their source of emission through engineering controls is an accepted basic principle of industrial
hygiene. Equipment and processes which are located or take place in areas that may lead to contamination of other areas
should be provided with engineering controls, where necessary and feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions proposed in paragraph (e)(3) are intended to limit the opportunity for microbiological contamination
of building systems and structures. Although individual microbes are not visible to the naked eye, colonies of microbes
are. Moisture can lead to microbiological growth in indoor spaces, within HVAC systems, or within building structures,
and thus to a variety of detrimental health effects. The employer therefore, is required to take preventive and corrective
actions to minimize microbiological growth. Preventive action includes routine inspection for biological growth,
with required corrective actions such as repairing water leaks, drying, replacing, or cleaning wet materials, and
removal of visible microbiological growth (Exs. 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;502). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions proposed in paragraph (e)(4) are intended to restrict indoor exposure to hazardous substances such
as pesticides and chemicals used for cleaning and maintenance purposes. The Agency believes that proper use of such
substances is important to limit incidental exposures to those performing cleaning and maintenance as well as to
other employees who might be incidentally exposed. Manufacturers recommendations for use of these products often
address aspects of ventilation, employee protection, occupancy limitations, and other protective measures. Thus,
the Agency has proposed to require that chemicals covered under this paragraph must be used in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations. To further limit the potential for incidental exposures to these chemicals the standard proposes
to require that employees in areas to be treated by such chemicals are to be notified within at least 24 hours prior to
their application.

Air Quality During Renovation and Remodeling: Paragraph (f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (f)(1) proposes to require implementation of specific procedures to minimize degradation of air quality
during renovation and remodeling activities (Exs. 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;444B). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f)(2) proposes to require development and implementation of a work plan to restrict entry of air contaminants
into other work areas during remodeling, renovation, and similar activities (Ex. 3&hyph;444b). Where appropriate,
elements of the workplan to be considered are requirements of this standard, implementation of means to assure that
HVAC systems continue to function effectively during remodeling and renovation activities, isolation or containment
of work areas and appropriate negative pressure containment, air contaminant suppression controls or auxiliary
air filtration, and controls to prevent air contaminant entry into HVAC systems. Finally, paragraph (e)(3), proposes
to require 24 hour advance notification of employees, or promptly in emergency situations, of work to be performed
on the building that may introduce air contaminants into their work area. Such notification must include anticipated
adverse impacts on indoor air quality or workplace conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions under proposed paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) are intended to ensure that renovation, remodeling and
similar activities are performed in a manner that will reduce the potential for air contaminants generated during
those activities from entering other areas of the building. Such activities which may involve demolition, sanding,
surface refinishing, component removal and replacement, etc. can result in hazardous substance emission from solvents,
paints, carpets, etc. and can also produce high levels of particulate contamination. To control such emissions,
the standard proposes to require employers to develop a workplan for the implementation of appropriate work procedures
and controls such as exhaust ventilation, isolation, containment, or use of wet methods during renovation and remodeling
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (f)(3) proposes to require notification of employees in the vicinity of renovation and remodeling
activities who may be subject to incidental exposure to emissions produced during such activities (Ex. 3&hyph;444B).
This notification must also apprise affected employees of the potential adverse impact on air quality. Informing
employees of potential workplace hazards is felt by the Agency to be imperative for the success of any safety and health
program. OSHA believes that employees can do much to protect themselves if they are informed of the nature of the hazards
to which they are exposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (g) proposes to require employers to provide special training for workers involved in maintenance activities
and those involved in HVAC system operations, and to provide certain pertinent information to all employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(1) proposes to require that maintenance and HVAC operations personnel be trained in the use of personal
protective equipment (PPE) required to be worn; training on how to maintain adequate ventilation of exhaust fumes
during building cleaning and maintenance; and training of maintenance personnel on how to minimize adverse effects
on indoor air quality during the use and disposal of chemicals and other agents [Exs. 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;41,
3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;440, 3&hyph;444B, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;502]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(2) proposes to require that all employees shall be informed of the contents of the standard and its appendices,
signs and symptoms associated with building-related illness, and the requirement under proposed subparagraphs
(d)(12) and (d)(13) which directs the employer to evaluate the effectiveness of the building systems, if necessary,
upon receipt of complaints from employees of building-related illness [Exs. 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;412,
3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444B, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;529]. The information proposed to be provided under
this subparagraph need not be conveyed to employees through formal training sessions or courses. Informing employees
can be accomplished, for example, through written means such as fact sheets, memos, or posted bulletins. OSHA will
provide in a non-mandatory appendix to the final rule an example illustrating what information is to be provided to
employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (g)(3) proposes to require that the employer make training materials developed under these provisions,
including the standard and its appendices, available for inspection and copying by employees, designated employee
representatives, the Director, and the Assistant Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training and information requirements are routine components of OSHA health standards. The inclusion of training
and information requirements reflects the Agency's conviction, as noted above, that informed employees are essential
to the operation of any effective health program. OSHA believes that informing and training employees about the hazards
to which they are exposed will contribute substantially to reducing the incidence of diseases caused by workplace
conditions. Further, as noted earlier, it has been OSHA's experience that unacceptable indoor air quality is often
the result of deficiencies in implementing effective HVAC system operation and maintenance programs. The Agency
believes that specialized training of workers performing those activities is, therefore, necessary to ensure successful
performance of their jobs.

Recordkeeping: Paragraph (h) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (h) proposes to require that employers maintain records of: All written information regarding the IAQ
compliance program required to be established under paragraph (c); inspection and maintenance records required
to be established under paragraph (d) [Ex. 3&hyph;26], which must include the specific remedial or maintenance actions
taken, the name and affiliation of the individual performing the work, and the date of the inspection or maintenance
activity; and records of employee complaints of building-related illness required to be established under paragraph
(c)(5) of this section [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (h) also proposes to require the employer to retain these for at least the previous three years [Ex. 3&hyph;502],
except that operation, maintenance, inspection, and compliance program records need not be retained for three years
if rendered obsolete by the establishment and replacement of more recent records, or rendered irrelevant due to HVAC
system replacement or redesign. The records required to be maintained by the employer are to be made available to employees
and their designated representative and the Assistant Secretary for examination and copying. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraph (h)(6) proposes to require that whenever the employer ceases to do business records that are required
to be maintained by the employer are to be provided to and retained by the successor employer [Ex. 3&hyph;440B]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8 (c) of the Act authorizes OSHA to require employers to make, keep, and preserve, and make available to the
Secretary or the Director records regarding their activities as prescribed by regulation as appropriate and necessary
for the enforcement of the Act or for developing information regarding the causes and prevention of occupational
illnesses. As noted earlier, the Agency believes that development of written compliance plans are essential to implementation
of a successful IAQ program. The written compliance program, inspection and maintenance records, and operator and
maintenance schedules which are required to be established under the proposal, are required to be retained under
this paragraph. This information essentially documents the desired performance levels of HVAC systems, and the
measures necessary to maintain those levels of performance, as well as other measures which should be followed to
ensure acceptable indoor air quality. Such data must be available for use by designated persons, current employers,
successor employers, and employees as a blueprint for program implementation. Without such data, air quality problems
would likely arise due to ignorance of such elements as design occupant densities, equipment schedules, maintenance
requirements and frequencies, etc. Records required to be established in response to employee complaints of building-related
illness are also required to be retained under this paragraph. Such complaints require the employer to evaluate the
need for, and to take if necessary, remedial action to correct observed problems [Ex. 3&hyph;1, 3&hyph;444B]. Information
regarding employee illness is essential in identifying causal factors and trends in adverse health effects. Retention
of this health data will aid in the recognition, evaluation and correction of indoor air quality deficiencies which
lead to building-related illnesses. Records of building-related illness are proposed to be required to be retained
for at least the previous 3 years. OSHA believes that requiring record retention for 3 years of building-related illnesses
which occur in nonindustrial environments is reasonable. Such illnesses are not viewed in the same context as industrial
illnesses which may be associated with long latency periods, and thus necessitate very long retention periods for
health records. Establishment and maintenance of building-related illness records is primarily for the purpose
of documenting indoor air quality degradation, so that corrective action can be taken. Requiring records to be retained
to preserve a 3 year history of building-related illness, is proposed as being reasonable to aid in the tracking of
air quality trends and past experiences [Ex. 3&hyph;502]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other records are also required to be retained for at least the previous 3 years, except to the extent they become obsolete.
OSHA does not believe that records such as maintenance and operating schedules which become irrelevant due to HVAC
system modification or replacement need be retained further. The records required to be retained under this paragraph
must be transferred to successor employers. Since these records contain information specific to the building or
facility, as opposed to specific employers, such records should be maintained within affected buildings for future
use.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) OSHA has estimated a substantial productivity benefit resulting from this proposed standard. What additional
studies and other information are available that demonstrate any effect on productivity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) OSHA has preliminarily determined that the direct costs of compliance with this standard will not unduly harm
small entities. However, OSHA did not determine how the smoking restrictions in this regulation would affect demand,
and therefore profitability, for establishments which provide services and commodities which would be affected
by the proposal (e.g., restaurants and bars). OSHA requests comments, including empirical data regarding the demand
elasticity of such establishments' patrons who will not be permitted to smoke in the presence of employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If economic feasibility is shown to be an issue for establishments such as bars and restaurants, what alternative
feasible methods of compliance would prevent workers from being exposed to tobacco smoke?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What other workplaces have circumstances under which provisions of this standard may not be feasible?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) During renovation and remodelling, what are the specific elements for implementing control measures to minimize
degradation of the IAQ of employees performing such activities and employees in other areas of the building? What
are the unit costs associated with the implementation of each control (capital and labor)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Please describe practices in your workplace by providing answers to the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Describe the business, SIC code number and number of employees in the establishment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_What type of ventilation systems are presently being used?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_If carbon dioxide monitoring is conducted, how often is it being done and by whom and what are the associated costs?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Does your establishment have a policy on IAQ? When and why was it implemented? What are the major components? How many
employees are affected? What type of costs and cost savings have been associated with such a policy (e.g., operating,
maintenance, retrofitting HVAC systems, property damage due to poor IAQ, employee productivity, cleaning, etc.)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Is smoking allowed in your establishment? If yes, is it limited to designated smoking areas with separate ventilation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scope and Application, Paragraph (a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Is it necessary and feasible to extend coverage of the entire standard to industrial facilities as well as nonindustrial
facilities? Why? Why not? Which provisions lend themselves to application to industrial environments?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Can coverage of the standard feasibly be extended to some industrial facilities but not others? If so, what characteristics
distinguish those workplaces in which it is feasible or necessary to apply the standard from those in which it is not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The regulation as drafted would require employers generally to prohibit smoking by their customers (such as in
bars, restaurants, and stores) where not already banned by a government entity if employees would be exposed to ETS
from customer smoking. Comment is requested on the appropriateness of this provision, possible alternatives, and
feasibility issues.

Definitions, Paragraph (b)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Is the proposed definition of ``air contaminants'' sufficiently descriptive to inform employers of the hazards
which may adversely affect indoor air quality? If not, what additional information should be included in the definition?
Which elements included in the definition are not reflective of hazards which affect indoor air quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Can employers reasonably be expected to be able to detect the presence of air contaminants, as defined, and determine
whether they present a significant risk of material impairment of employee health? What methods are available to
detect indoor air contaminants? What criteria should be used to evaluate the degree of risk that the presence of air
contaminants pose to employees?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the proposed definition of ``building systems'' sufficiently descriptive to indicate which systems the employer
must attend to in order to assure acceptable indoor air quality? Are the systems listed in the definition those that
directly affect indoor air quality? If not, why not? What other systems affect indoor air quality that are not specifically
cited in the definition, and how do they influence indoor air quality? How must such systems be maintained and operated
in order to assure adequate indoor air quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the term ``building-related illness'' sufficiently descriptive and inclusive of the medical conditions
that can arise from poor indoor air quality? If not, what other medical conditions should be addressed under the definition
and why? Which conditions listed in the definition, if any, should not be considered as ``building-related illness''
and why?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Is it necessary and appropriate to require employers to authorize a ``designated person'' to be responsible for
ensuring compliance with an indoor air quality standard? Why? Why not? If it is appropriate to require a designated
person, what training should designated persons have in order to carry out their responsibilities under the proposed
rule? Should the designated person be a person who is a full-time employee who is within the facility each day? Should
a designated person be on-site during each shift? Is it unreasonable to expect that due to the complexity of building
systems, a single designated person within a facility can successfully oversee and ensure adequate operation of
all building systems that affect indoor air quality? Why? Why not? Would it be beneficial for the designated person
to receive an inventory of chemical and physical agents used by all employers on site in order to track chemical usage
and storage? Information collected could include date of receipt, amount applied or used, where and when in the facility
it was used, and how the remainder is stored.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Does the definition of the term ``HVAC system'' identify all components of HVAC systems which can adversely affect
indoor air quality if not properly operated and maintained? What other components should be included and why? What
components designated in the definition do not affect indoor air quality and why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Is the definition of ``nonindustrial work environment'' sufficiently descriptive to differentiate them from
industrial work environments? If not, what other descriptors should be included in the definition? Which types of
facilities and establishments proposed under the definition as nonindustrial work environments should not be subject
to this standard and why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Is the definition of ``renovation and remodeling'' appropriately descriptive of such activities? If not, what
modifications to the definition would more reasonably reflect industry view of the characteristics of such activities?

Indoor Air Quality Compliance Program, Paragraph (c)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Is it necessary and appropriate to require employers to establish a written IAQ compliance program in order to
assure the adequacy of indoor air quality in nonindustrial work environments? Why? Why not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If establishment of a written compliance program is necessary, are the informational elements proposed to be
developed under this rule appropriate and why? What is their function for successful implementation of the program?
Which other written material should be made part of the IAQ compliance program and why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Which informational elements proposed to be established as part of the IAQ program, if any, are irrelevant to successful
building system operation and maintenance? Why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Which informational elements proposed to be established as part of the IAQ program, if any, are not generally available
to the employer and why?

Compliance Program Implementation, Paragraph (d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Which of the implementation actions proposed under this paragraph are necessary and appropriate for maintenance
of acceptable indoor air quality. Why? Which are not? Why not? In this regard, specific comment is particularly sought
on the need for the following proposed elements of the implementation program:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Maintenance and operation of the HVAC system to provide at least a required minimum outside air ventilation rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Operation of the HVAC during all work shifts;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Use of exhaust ventilation during maintenance and housekeeping activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Maintenance of relative humidity to below 60%;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Requiring HVAC system evaluation where CO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels exceed 800 ppm; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Requiring building system evaluation in response to employee complaints of building related illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Should the regulation prohibit the storage of hazardous substances in air transport pathways serving as return
air plenums? These areas may include area-ways, plenums, chases, corridors, and mechanical rooms serving as return
air plenums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Controls for Specific Contaminant Sources, Paragraph (e)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Will the proposed provisions addressing construction and operation of designated smoking areas assure that
employees working outside designated areas will not be exposed to ETS? If so, which of the proposed provisions may
be unnecessary to achieve this goal? If not, is it necessary to prohibit smoking within indoor workplaces to eliminate
exposure to ETS or can the provisions as proposed be modified, or supplemented to prevent secondary exposure? If it
is believed that designated smoking areas will effectively contain tobacco smoke, comment is particularly sought
on the appropriateness of requiring designated smoking areas to be enclosed, exhausted directly to the outside and
maintained under negative pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Is the proposed provision requiring the use of measures such as local source capture exhaust ventilation or substitution
to control air contaminants emitted from point sources where general ventilation is inadequate, feasible or effective?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are the proposed provisions addressing control of microbial contamination effective, feasible, or necessary?
Why? Why not? What additional provisions, if any, should be included to preclude microbial contamination for adversely
affecting indoor air quality?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where hazardous chemicals are used in the workplace, including cleaning and maintenance chemicals, is employee
notification of their use 24 hours prior to their application, as proposed, necessary to mitigate potential incidental
exposure to such chemicals? To what extent does the use of such chemicals in nonindustrial environments present a
health risk to other employees, or to the acceptability of indoor air quality? Which chemicals and their uses are of
particular concern in non-industrial indoor environments?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Are the proposed provisions specifically addressing renovation and remodeling activities necessary and appropriate
and why? Particularly, are the proposed requirements to develop a work plan focusing special attention on HVAC systems,
area isolation or containment, and air contaminant suppression controls necessary to limit the potential for degradation
of air quality? Why? Why not? What other provisions, if any, should be included to limit the effects that renovation
and remodeling activities may have on indoor environments?

Employee Information and Training, Paragraph (g)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Are the provisions proposing that building systems maintenance workers receive special training with respect
to the use of personal protective equipment, use of ventilation during cleaning and maintenance activities, and
on proper use and disposal of hazardous chemicals and other agents, necessary and appropriate to assure maintenance
of acceptable indoor air quality? Why? Why not?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should training of building maintenance and systems workers include additional specific elements not proposed
in this notice? What should this additional training consist of and why? Which workers should this training be provided
to_all maintenance and building systems workers, supervisors, crew leaders? Should such training be provided periodically,
or would initial training suffice?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is it necessary, as proposed, to require that all employees in the facility be informed of the contents of the standard
and of signs and symptoms associated with building-related illness? Why? Why not?

Recordkeeping, Paragraph (h)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Will retention of records, as proposed, enhance the potential for reducing indoor air quality problems? Will
retention of maintenance records, IAQ compliance program records, and records of employee complaints serve as necessary
documentation upon which actions and decisions can be made to improve deficiencies found in facility air quality?
If so, how will these records serve that purpose?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What length of time should the records required to be established under this proposal be required to be retained?
Is OSHA's proposed 3-year retention period reasonable? Why? Why not? Should different retention periods be specified
for each particular record, and if so, why?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is it reasonable to require transfer of records from an employee to a successor employer? What other mechanisms
are available to ensure that the facility-specific records remain at the building or facility in the event of tenant
turnover?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 25 states and territories with their own OSHA-approved occupational safety and health plans must adopt a comparable
standard within six months of the publication date of a final standard. These 25 states are: Alaska, Arizona, California,
Connecticut (for public employees only), New York (for state and local government employees only), Hawaii, Indiana,
Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Puerto Rico, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Virgin Islands, Washington, and Wyoming. Until such time as a state
standard is promulgated, Federal OSHA will provide interim enforcement assistance, as appropriate, in these states.

IX. Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October
30, 1987), regarding Federalism. This Order requires that agencies, to the extent possible, refrain from limiting
state policy options, consult with states prior to taking any actions which would restrict state policy options,
and take such actions only when there is clear constitutional authority and the presence of a problem of national scope.
The Order provides for preemption of state law only if there is a clear Congressional intent for the Agency to do so.
Any such preemption is to be limited to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) expresses Congress' intent to preempt state laws that
establish occupational safety and health standards on issues on which Federal OSHA has promulgated standards. Under
Section 18, a state can avoid preemption, however, if it submits, and obtains Federal approval of a plan for the development
of such standards and their enforcement. Therefore states with occupational safety and health plans approved under
Section 18 of the OSH Act will be able to develop their own state standards to deal with any special problems which might
be encountered in a particular state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Supreme Court has held that Section 18 does not preempt state or local laws of general applicability
that do not conflict with OSHA standards and that regulate the conduct of workers and non workers alike.

 112 S. Ct. 2374 (1992). Such laws regulate workers simply as members of the general public. OSHA recognizes that many
state and local governments have enacted provisions designed to protect the health of their residents by addressing
indoor air quality issues including the presence of ETS. It is OSHA's intent that state and local laws consistent with
this standard shall remain in effect to the full extent permissible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 CFR part 1320 sets forth procedures for agencies to follow in obtaining OMB clearance for information collection
requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. This proposed indoor air quality standard
requires the employer to allow OSHA access to records. In accordance with the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction
Act and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, OSHA certifies that it has submitted the information collection
requirements for this proposal to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of that Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average five minutes per response. Send
any comments regarding this burden estimate, or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to the Office of Information Management, Department of Labor, room N&hyph;1301, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management

Filing of Testimony and Evidence Before the Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any party requesting more than ten (10) minutes for presentation at the informal public hearing, or who intends to
submit documentary evidence, must provide in quadruplicate the testimony and evidence to be presented at the informal
public hearing. One copy shall not be stapled or bound and be suitable for copying. These materials must be provided

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each submission will be reviewed in light of the amount of time requested in the notice of intention to appear. In instances
where the information contained in the submission does not justify the amount of time requested, a more appropriate
amount of time will be allocated and the participant will be notified of that fact prior to the informal public hearing.

Conduct and Nature of Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hearing will commence at 9:30 a.m. on the first day. At that time, any procedural matters relating to the proceeding
will be resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of an informal rulemaking hearing is established in the legislative history of section 6 of the OSH Act and
is reflected by OSHA's rules of procedure for hearings (29 CFR 1911.15(a)). Although the presiding officer is an Administrative
Law Judge and questioning by interested persons is allowed on crucial issues, the proceeding is informal and legislative
in type. The Agency's intent, in essence, is to provide interested persons with an opportunity to make effective oral
presentations which can proceed expeditiously in the absence of procedural restraints which impede or protract
the rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, since the hearing is primarily for information gathering and clarification, it is an informal administrative
proceeding rather than an adjudicative one. The technical rules of evidence, for example do not apply. The regulations
that govern hearings and the pre-hearing guidelines to be issued for this hearing will ensure fairness and due process
and also facilitate the development of a clear, accurate and complete record. Those rules and guidelines will be interpreted
in a manner that furthers that development. Thus, questions of relevance, procedure and participation generally
will be decided so as to favor development of the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing will be conducted in accordance with 29 CFR part 1911. It should be noted that &sect;1911.4 specifies the
Assistant Secretary may upon reasonable notice issue alternatives procedures to expedite proceedings or for other
good cause. The hearing will be presided over by an Administrative Law Judge who makes no decision or recommendation
on the merits of OSHA's proposal. The responsibility of the Administrative Law Judge is to ensure that the hearing
proceeds at a reasonable pace and in an orderly manner. The Administrative Law Judge, therefore, will have all the
powers necessary and appropriate to conduct a full and fair informal hearing as provided in 29 CFR part 1911 including
the powers: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To regulate the course of the proceedings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To dispose of procedural requests, objections and comparable matters; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) sampling is one of the measurement tools used to characterize indoor air quality. Indoor CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 air concentrations are indicator measures for effectiveness of building ventilation. Elevated carbon dioxide
levels can be an indicator of inadequate outside air exchange rates. Carbon dioxide concentrations below 800 ppm
generally indicate that the ventilation is adequate for diluting occupant-generated contaminants. The carbon
dioxide concentration and the associated outside air ventilation rate offers no confidence as to the adequacy of
dilution and removal of other contaminants released in the space. There is also no implication of health effects associated
with this level of carbon dioxide, or any implication of a permissible exposure limit. Health effects have been observed
in buildings where the carbon dioxide levels were below 800 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSHA recommends this procedure:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Design a program of air sampling that includes samples taken: (a) at least every three months to detect the effects
of seasonal changes (summer/winter transition seasons); (b) after adjustments have been made to the HVAC system;
and (c) at any time there is reason to believe air quality has deteriorated. At least once a year carbon dioxide levels
should be monitored when the HVAC system is providing minimum outside air ventilation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Measure carbon dioxide concentrations late in the morning (about 11:00 am) and late in the afternoon before workers
leave for home (about 3:30 pm). These are the times when carbon dioxide levels should be closest to equilibrium levels
and should give the best indication of effective air exchange rates. These normal use patterns may be altered by visitor
frequency and should be accounted for in the monitoring scheme.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Conduct the sampling at a height of between 3 and 5 feet above the floor, or about the height of employees' heads.
Make sure the samples are taken at least 2 feet from where people are breathing. Take the samples at a sufficient distance
from any other sources of carbon dioxide so these sources do not affect the measurements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Select sampling locations in normally-occupied areas where the ventilation mixing would be the least effective.
These areas might include corners of a room farthest from supply ducts and exhaust vents, locations surrounded by
barriers that might affect air movement, or rooms at the far end of a ventilation supply duct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Measure the carbon dioxide levels outside the building for comparison with the indoor levels. Average outdoor
carbon dioxide levels are typically 300 to 500 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Use colormetric detector tubes or other direct-reading instruments calibrated and operated according to the
manufacturer's instructions for measuring carbon dioxide concentrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take sampling and analytical error into account before comparing results with the 800 ppm benchmark. All measuring
devices have a degree of uncertainty associated with the results. An estimate of that uncertainty is called the sampling
and analytical error. The uncertainty can be reduced by taking more samples with the same device. Table A&hyph;1 can
be used to assure 95 percent confidence that the average of the results from a set of detector tube samples is less than
800 ppm. OSHA recommends these following steps: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Calculate the average of the measurements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Add the detector tube results together.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Divide that total by the number of samples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Compare the average of the results with the number of samples taken in the second column in the table. If the average
is less than the number in the table, there is confidence that the CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels are less than 800 ppm. Example: Three samples are taken and the results are 650 ppm, 710 ppm, and 680 ppm. The average
of these three samples is 680 ppm (2,040 ppm divided by 3). The results indicate confidence that the carbon dioxide
levels are less than 800 ppm since the 680 ppm average of the three samples is less than 695 ppm

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Take the same number of samples indoors and outdoors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Average the results of the outdoor and indoor samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that a public meeting will be held to discuss testing procedures
to demonstrate that an over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen drug product protects users from ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation.
FDA is holding this meeting after considering public comments regarding UVA claims and testing procedures received
in response to the agency's notice of proposed rulemaking and letters sent by the agency. In addition, FDA is reopening
the administrative record for the proposed rulemaking for OTC sunscreen drug products to allow comment on matters
considered at the meeting. FDA intends to invite guests and consultants to address technical matters related to the
questions listed in this document. This meeting is part of the ongoing review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

 In the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 28194), FDA published a notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC sunscreen drug products. In the
proposed rule, the agency discussed OTC sunscreen drug products that claim to provide protection from UVA radiation
and the public health significance of UVA radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28232 and 28233). The agency also discussed testing
procedures for sunscreens that absorb UVA radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28248 to 28250). The comment period for comments
related to UVA ingredients, claims, and testing closed on November 8, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To ensure that sunscreen drug products having UVA protection claims offer significant UVA protection, the agency
proposed that an OTC sunscreen ingredient must have an absorption spectrum extending to 360 nanometers (nm) or above
in order to display UVA protection claims in its labeling (58 FR 28194 at 28233). The product would also have to demonstrate
meaningful UVA protection by satisfying UVA testing procedures that would be included in the monograph. However,
these procedures have yet to be established. The agency requested specific comments on appropriate procedures to
be used. Previously, the agency had requested specific information on UVA protection factors (Ref. 1).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule (58 FR 28194 at 28248 to 28250), the agency tentatively suggested that a testing method similar
to the one described by Lowe et al. (Ref. 2) could be used to demonstrate that a sunscreen drug product provides protection
against UVA radiation. This method uses 48- and 72-hour erythema reactions and 12- to 14-day melanogenesis in skin
sensitized with 8-methoxsalen (8&hyph;MOP). However, because the agency did not have enough information or data
to propose a method for determining UVA protection in the proposed rule, the agency stated that a method should be developed
and validated in the same manner as was the sunscreen testing procedure for protection against ultraviolet B (UVB)
radiation (i.e., sunscreen protection factor (SPF) testing). Furthermore, the agency requested comments and data
regarding an appropriate testing methodology for OTC sunscreen drug products that afford UVA protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received a substantial amount of comments, data, and information regarding UVA ingredients, claims,
and testing procedures. After evaluating the submitted material, the agency finds that there are two basic interrelated
questions regarding testing procedures for determining UVA protection that must be addressed before the agency
can complete its assessment of appropriate UVA ingredients and claims. These questions are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What action spectrum best describes the biological risk of UVA radiation (i.e., which ultraviolet radiation
wavelengths are most likely to cause biological damage), and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Which testing procedure best defines the UVA protection provided by a sunscreen drug product? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Action Spectra for UVA-Related Skin Damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments discussed the appropriate action spectrum for biological risk associated with UVA radiation.
One comment stated that, in developing a consensus regarding an acceptable assay for determining the UVA protection
provided by a sunscreen drug product, the specific UVA effect that is to be blocked must be considered. These effects
include UVA erythema, UVA-induced drug photosensitivity, immediate pigment darkening, delayed tanning, or other
effects of photodamage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that several action spectra describing different aspects of solar-induced skin damage have been
determined in a number of different species and cell types. The comment described these aspects as photocarcinogenesis,
DNA damage, photoaging, mutagenicity, and immunosuppression. The comment maintained that each action spectrum
for UV-induced damage closely tracks the human erythemal action spectrum. The comment stated that the best summary
of the biological risk of UV light has been published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) (Ref.
3). The CIE Hazard Spectrum embodies the comprehensive, yet normal, risks to human skin due to full-spectrum UV exposure
and reflects the findings of the action spectra biological responses to UV described above. The CIE Hazard Spectrum
shows that the damage risk for UVB at 290 nm is 100 times higher than that at 320 nm. The damage risk at 320 nm is 100 times
higher than that at 400 nm. The damage risk at 320 nm is at least 10 times greater than the damage risk at 340 nm. This spectrum
shows that the most damage potential is in the UVB wavelengths (290 to 320 nm), followed by the shorter UVA wavelengths
(320 to 340 nm). The comment cited numerous scientific articles and submitted action spectra to support its statements
(Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that although protection against UVA is important, it is not as important as protection against
UVB. The comment argued that, based on the CIE Hazard Spectrum, the UVB wavelengths contribute 80 to 85 percent of the
damage risk in sunlight, while UVA contributes 15 to 20 percent of the damage risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that some known effects on humans caused by UVA radiation include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Photoaging of the skin,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) UVA-induced hypersensitivities,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Augmentation of skin cancers, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Erythema. However, the comment noted that there is no single known action spectrum to describe which parts of the
UVA spectrum are most active in causing these effects. Therefore, the comment maintained that it is not appropriate
to use the UVA-erythema action spectrum for testing purposes. The comment stated that UVA protection should be assessed
in relation to UVB protection and that the assumption should be made that all wavelengths are equally important.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment stated that the ``current test for erythema'' is inadequate to test for the full spectrum of UVA radiation
because erythema is not a valid measurement of UVA exposure. The comment argued that using the erythema action spectrum
to test for UVA protection will give consumers a false sense of the extent of UVA protection afforded by a product. The
comment added that the immediate pigment darkening (IPD) action spectrum is preferable because it is broad enough
to take into account almost all UVA wavelengths. Another comment stated that the IPD action spectrum is indicative
of a true broad spectrum UVA response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that the IPD action spectrum was first described to extend from 300 to 420 nm, with a broad peak between
340 and 370 nm (Ref. 5). The action spectrum was later described to extend from 300 to 620 nm, with a peak effectiveness
between 400 and 500 nm (visible light) (Ref. 6). Because of the difference between these two reported spectra, the
comment reevaluated the action spectrum for IPD between 310 and 400 nm and reported that the IPD action spectrum extends
from 320 to 400 nm with a low peak around 340 nm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with determining which testing procedure is appropriate for use in validating the UVA protection provided
by a sunscreen drug product, the agency must determine what portion of the UVA spectrum should be blocked by the product
before consumers are effectively protected against the hazards of UVA radiation. The agency would like to consider
the following specific questions at the meeting: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Which action spectra are the most important with respect to skin damage caused by UVA radiation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Is the erythema action spectrum an adequate surrogate for UVA biological risk, or is some other action spectrum
(such as the IPD action spectrum) more appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Can a sunscreen drug product that protects consumers against the shorter UVA wavelengths (320 to 340 nm) but not
against longer UVA wavelengths (340 to 400 nm) prevent significant UVA damage? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What should consumers expect from a sunscreen drug product that is labeled to provide protection against UVA radiation
or as a ``broad spectrum'' sunscreen? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

II. UVA Testing Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency did not propose a method for determining UVA protection in the tentative final monograph for OTC sunscreen
drug products. The agency stated that a method should be developed and validated in the same manner as the sunscreen
testing procedure for protection against UVB radiation (58 FR 28194 at 28250). The agency noted that any such method
should clearly demonstrate that a particular product provides significant protection against UVA radiation. The
method should include the use of a control sunscreen preparation that absorbs UVA radiation and that can be used to
assure the reliability of the testing procedure and equipment. The method should demonstrate that a sunscreen ingredient
either does or does not protect against UVA radiation. The agency requested comments and data regarding an appropriate
testing method for OTC sunscreen drug products that protect against UVA radiation. In response, the agency received
information and data pertaining to several UVA testing procedures, including both in vivo and in vitro test methods.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended adoption of an in vitro test method that does not rely upon either photosensitization or nonsolar
light sources for determining UVA protection for normal skin (Ref. 8). According to the comment, this method involves:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Determining the UV absorbance spectrum of the sunscreen product, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Calculating a convolution spectrum by multiplying the solar spectrum with the current CIE Hazard Spectrum, and

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Incorporating the sunscreen transmission spectrum into the convolution spectrum to obtain a UVA effectiveness
ratio which is conveniently expressed as a UVA protection percentage (APP). The comment maintained that, unlike
other methods, the APP represents the fraction of full spectrum UVA (320 to 400 nm) removed by a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment stated that because the original ``full spectrum'' method produces an SPF value analogous to the clinically
determined SPF number, the APP has direct relevance to the SPF determined on human subjects and is a subset of the full-spectrum
SPF determination. The comment added that once an SPF has been determined clinically, it is simple to take the full-spectrum
absorbance spectrum and calculate the APP based on the clinical test results. Therefore, although the determination
of the APP does involve in vitro measurements, it also relies on direct clinical measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment contended that there are a number of advantages to using the APP system:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It is a subset of the existing SPF for sunscreen drug products and, therefore, relates to an erythemal endpoint
in normal skin;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It does not unnecessarily duplicate clinical testing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) It clearly demonstrates whether a sunscreen drug product provides meaningful protection against UVA radiation,
and it is useful in determining comparative UVA protection;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) It avoids the deficiencies of nonsolar light sources, photosensitizing chemicals, the failure of dose reciprocity
for human UVA exposures, and endpoints which do not relate to known UVA damage to human skin;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) It is independent of exposure dose or duration;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) It includes all the UVA wavelengths in their direct proportion and intensity as found in natural sunlight; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) It is directly relevant to overall product effectiveness. The comment added that in the absence of a light source
specific to the UVA range, APP determination is the best measurement of a product's UVA protection level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the in vitro APP test is difficult to extend to a human in vivo situation and that the test cannot
be used to study substantivity or stability. The comment added that because the APP test uses the erythema action spectrum
and a mathematical extraction of the UVA segment of the solar spectrum, it overestimates the actual amount of UVA radiation
blocked by most products. A reply comment argued that the APP technique is derived from well-studied and extensively
published in vitro SPF methodology (Refs. 9, 10, and 11), that it is simple to evaluate water resistance using this
model, and that data on water resistance have been published. The reply comment added that APP values are derived from
the same spectral data (320 to 400 nm) that provide in vitro SPF values. The final SPF value from clinical studies is
compared to the in vitro SPF and the absorbance spectrum can be matched to the exact clinical SPF for UVA calculations.
The UVA portion of the sunscreen's efficacy can then be calculated from the in vitro SPF data. Therefore, the comment
argued that the APP has direct relevance to the clinical effectiveness of the sunscreen product, but does not require
the exposure of human subjects to unnecessary UV radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that an in vitro method developed by Diffey and Robson (Ref. 12) avoids many of the limitations of
in vivo methods (e.g., lack of reciprocity and light sources that produce 5 to 20 times the intensity of the sun) and
allows the correct estimation of the attenuating power of a sunscreen drug product. The comment described this method
as recording photocurrent in 5 nm steps from 290 to 400 nm and measuring the spectral transmission of UV radiation through
a sample of Transpore
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tape with and without sunscreen applied. Transpore
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tape is UV radiation transparent and has a rough surface that distributes sunscreen products in a way similar to the
uneven surface of the skin. Any radiation source may be used, providing there is a continuous power distribution between
290 and 400 nm. This method assesses the SPF of a product and the UVA/UVB ratio. The UVA/UVB ratio compares the reduction
of UV radiation in the UVA region with that in the UVB region of the spectrum. According to the comment, this ratio can
be used as an indicator of the UVA protection properties of a sunscreen drug product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment claimed that the method developed by Diffey and Robson (Ref. 12) has many advantages, as well as being simple,
inexpensive, and well correlated with clinical testing. The comment noted that the method does not require a biological
endpoint such as erythema, tanning, or immediate pigment darkening. The comment stated that the method provides
a basis for the classification of the UVA protection provided by a product and added that a manufacturer planned to
utilize the Diffey and Robson method to standardize the UVA claims of its products. Sunscreen products would be labeled
with one to four stars depending upon the amount of UVA protection provided by the products as determined by the Diffey
and Robson method. The comment concluded that using the ``star'' rating system for UVA claims and the SPF designation
for UVB claims provides a simple method for consumers to determine the protective nature of a sunscreen product. The
comment submitted a description of the manufacturer's methodology and ``star'' rating system (Ref. 13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment submitted data describing the application of this ratio method to the determination of the SPF and
UVA/UVB ratio of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide dispersions (Ref. 14). The comment noted that the accuracy of this
method is enhanced by good product application and that the in vitro results obtained by this method show good agreement
with in vivo values.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, another comment contended that the Diffey and Robson method (Ref. 12) has been shown to have poor correlation
with clinical results (Ref. 15). The comment stated that the Diffey and Robson method has been used as the basis for
``quantifying'' UVA protection expressed as ``stars'' on the package labeling of some sunscreen products sold in
Europe (Ref. 16). Without using an action spectrum such as the CIE UV Hazard Spectrum or the erythemal efficacy spectrum
for weighting, the ``star'' method considers all UVA wavelengths as having the same erythemal effectiveness. The
``star'' value results from an unweighted ratio of the UVA absorbance to the UVB absorbance of the product. Therefore,
the comment maintained that a low SPF product with a flat absorbance spectrum could get four ``stars'' (i.e., the highest
rating), while a higher SPF product would get fewer ``stars'' because the higher SPF product would absorb disproportionately
higher levels of UVB, similar to the action spectrum for erythema. The comment stated that the ``star'' concept is
in direct contrast to the accepted concept of formulating sunscreen drug products to provide the most protection
in the most damaging portion of the UV spectrum. The comment contended that the ``star'' method is misleading to consumers
and added that the use of the ``star'' method in England has been criticized by dermatologists, who have asked that
the system be withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment recommended that the agency adopt the current Standards Association of Australia (SAS) UVA (broad spectrum)
test method AS&hyph;2406 as an objective measure of UVA blocking (Ref. 17). This method measures the percent transmission
of the test sunscreen drug product between 320 and 360 nm. If an 8-micrometer layer of appropriately dissolved sunscreen
product does not transmit more than 10 percent of UV radiation at any wavelength from 320 to 360 nm inclusive, the product
may be considered as providing broad spectrum protection. The comment contended that this method has a number of advantages.
UV protection claims are most appropriately substantiated by measuring the blocking of UV directly rather than measuring
some consequence of UVA exposure. Thin film spectrophotometric evaluation of sunscreen drug products has reached
a level of technical proficiency to permit instrumental evaluation of UVA blocking potential. Adopting an already
accepted standard protocol will enhance the ability of the United States sunscreen industry to compete equally in
foreign markets. This test will substantially reduce testing costs. No human subjects are used. The comment added
that this method provides a strict criterion that serves to identify only the most effective UVA blockers. The comment
submitted several UVA scans to demonstrate that the SAS method differentiates between the ``poorly effective''
oxybenzone-containing sunscreens and an assortment of products containing ``excellent'' UVA blockers, e.g.,
titanium dioxide and avobenzone (Parsol 1789) (Ref. 17). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments contended that there are several deficiencies in the SAS method. The results are not correlated to a clinical
SPF test. Numerous studies have shown that solution and thin-film spectra are not relevant to actual product performance
on skin. The performance of the sunscreen is evaluated only in the limited range of 320 to 360 nm, rather than throughout
the entire UVA spectrum (320 to 400 nm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments recommended that the agency not adopt in vitro methods that rely on measuring the transmission of UVA
radiation through either epidermis or a UV-transparent skin cast (Refs. 18 and 19). The comments contended that these
methods are inappropriate because they use nonsolar UVA radiation sources and limited range UVA detectors or detectors
without an appropriately weighted response. The comments stated that these limitations would cause the results
to be nonrelevant to the actual responses of normal skin to full-spectrum natural sunlight. The comments mentioned
that one method (Ref. 19) contains a small but significant contamination by UVB energy below 320 nm that would adversely
affect the resulting efficacy values and lead to erroneous measures of UVA efficacy. The comments stated that the
other method (Ref. 18) skews results toward the longer UVA wavelengths because of the lamp's deficiencies in the shorter,
energy-rich UVA. The comments added that this skewing causes an overestimation of the protection of some products,
making those with ingredients that are long wavelength absorbers (such as avobenzone) look unrealistically effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment concluded that a rigorous and foolproof in vitro test method has not been established or validated. The
comment submitted two scientific publications that discuss some of the difficulties associated with in vitro sunscreen
testing techniques (Refs. 15 and 20). The comment argued that none of the current in vitro methods adequately evaluate
the photostability of sunscreens. It further stated that a validated in vivo human UVA test method must first be established.
Then, future in vitro test methods can be tested and validated against this standard.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments urged the agency not to adopt a testing method that utilizes photosensitizing chemicals. The comments
presented a number of arguments against this type of testing. It is considered unethical because of the carcinogenic
potential of the photosensitizing chemical (such as 8&hyph;MOP). The action spectrum (i.e., for 8&hyph;MOP induced
erythema) is artificial and inappropriate. The values obtained vary with the sensitizing chemical used and the spectrum
of the irradiating source used. The values obtained have no relevance to real-life situations. The testing may result
in a persistence of pigmentation or blistering reactions. 8&hyph;MOP sensitization exaggerates the biological
response and presents a risk of causing severe ulcerative acute reactions. 8&hyph;MOP puts subjects at risk for phototoxic
reactions for up to 6 hours after exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment contended that photosensitizing testing methods have a number of benefits, such as short irradiance
times, clearly defined endpoints, and reproducible results. The comment added that the results from these test methods
are relevant to patients taking 8&hyph;MOP or other photosensitizing drugs with similar action spectra. The comment
concluded that photosensitizing test methods could be useful to determine photoprotection factors for claims against
phototoxic reactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments urged the agency to accept the IPD testing method for determining UVA protection. One comment stated
that the IPD method is generally recognized by a substantial body of scientists as the preferred UVA testing method.
Several comments provided a number of benefits for using the IPD method. They claimed that this test method is the one
that is most representative of true conditions because it is an in vivo determination that accounts for biological
reactions that can occur on living skin. Unlike the testing procedure using skin photosensitized with 8&hyph;MOP,
the IPD test is indicative of a true broad spectrum response of normal healthy skin. Unlike erythema that is a response
only to the shorter wavelength UVA radiation, IPD is a response to broad spectrum UVA radiation. The IPD method requires
the use of considerably lower doses of radiation energy, thus exposing subjects to less risk. The IPD method uniquely
compliments the current SPF system by accurately reflecting the actual amount of long wave UVA radiation attenuated
by a sunscreen product. The IPD method is reliable, accurate, and reproducible. The IPD test can be performed in a standard
sunscreen evaluation laboratory with minimal adaptation of existing equipment. The comments concluded that until
well-established action spectra for specific UVA damage are established, IPD is the best method currently available
because it reflects broad spectrum UVA protection equally across the entire UVA spectrum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment submitted a testing protocol using IPD as the endpoint (Ref. 21). The comment stated that the suggested
testing procedure fulfilled a number of criteria. The resulting protection factor gives the consumer additional
information about the sunscreen number, complementing the SPF value. The response variable has a relatively flat
action spectrum (i.e., 320 to 400 nm, with a low peak at around 340 nm) throughout the region of interest. Using this
spectrum results in UVA protection values that closely reflect the actual amount of radiation reduced. The testing
response obeys dose reciprocity over the anticipated irradiance range. The test is practical with minimal risk to
subjects. The comment added that an eight-center clinical test has validated this method as acceptable for determining
UVA protection over the entire UVA spectrum, including long wavelength UVA (i.e., 340 to 400 nm). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment submitted clinical test results from the eight test sites (Ref. 21). Each testing facility completed
between 10 and 20 subjects. Subjects with skin types III and IV were used. Four sunscreen formulations and a vehicle
control were tested. The sunscreen products contained: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 7-percent padimate O, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 2-percent oxybenzone, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 5-percent oxybenzone, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 4 percent titanium dioxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protocol used a randomized, complete block design with all subjects at each testing center receiving all five
test materials. The comment stated that the studies were conducted similar to an SPF test, but a detailed protocol
was not submitted. For example, UVA dosages and application density of the test sunscreens were not noted. Six sites
used a 150&hyph;Watt (W) Xenon lamp with 3-millimeter (mm) WG335 and 1-mm UG11 filters. One site used a 1,000&hyph;W
Xenon lamp with 3-mm WG335 and 2-mm UG11 filters. One site used a Krypton lamp (i.e., Dermlite) of unspecified wattage.
The comment noted that neither of the last two UVA sources are recommended, and the results obtained using these lamps
were included for information purposes only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IPD threshold dose of UVA radiation was first measured on unprotected skin, then on protected skin. The ratio of
these two doses was then calculated to derive the UVA Protection Factor (UVA-PF). The IPD was graded immediately after
UV exposure, allowing complete testing in a single visit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment stated that comparison of test products indicated that the mean UVA-PF of the vehicle (1.7), the 7-percent
padimate O product (1.8), and the 2-percent oxybenzone product (1.8) were similar. The 5-percent oxybenzone product
(2.1) and the 4-percent titanium dioxide product (3.0) were both significantly greater than the other three products.
The titanium dioxide product was significantly greater than the 5-percent oxybenzone product. Although overall
statistical analysis detected significant site-by-product interaction, the individual results indicate that
this was primarily a quantitative interaction effect. The comment maintained that the consistency of the results
was encouraging, considering that this was the first experience in reading the IPD response for most of the participating
sites. The comment stated that these data indicate that the IPD procedure can reliably discriminate among products
that provide meaningful long wavelength UVA protection. The comment proposed using a base size of 20 subjects per
test and a 4-percent titanium dioxide product as a control to be run concurrently with each subject. The comment proposed
that the UVA-PF be the lower 95 percent confidence interval subtracted from the mean. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments recommended using an IPD test based upon two recent publications (Refs. 22 and 23). One study (Ref.
22) used a Xenon lamp equipped with a dichroic mirror filtered with 1-mm WG345, 1-mm WG320, and 1-mm UG11 filters. The
exposure increments were programmed in arithmetic increments of 2 Joules per square centimeter (J/cm2). On protected
skin, the increments were 3 or 4 J/cm2. Application density of the test sunscreen products was 2 milligrams per cm2.
Visual assessment of pigmentation was done immediately after exposure and was performed on the basis of a homogenous
pigmentation with well-defined borders as endpoints. The UVA-PF is determined as the ratio of minimal IPD dose with
protection to the minimal IPD dose without protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other study (Ref. 23) recommends the use of xenon or metal halide sources, or a xenon/metal halide combination,
with continuous spectra restricted to the UVA spectrum (320 to 390 nm) with filters, such as 3-mm WG335 and 1-mm UG5.
Six UVA doses ranging from 4 to about 30 J/cm2 are applied in 50 percent increments to subjects with skin types II, III,
and IV. The study states that with potential free interpolation, this is actually a 25-percent progression. The doses
applied on the protected skin are multiplied by the expected UVA-PF of the product under test. Observation of the responses
are delayed for at least 1 hour, and typically 2 hours, after exposure. The study states that results are less variable
if read at 2 hours. A simultaneous determination of the minimal IPD doses on protected and unprotected skin is done
at the same time in standard room and illumination conditions. Other parameters concerning the test area, size of
test sites, product application density, selection of volunteers, etc. follow the same current standards as for
the SPF determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments objected to the use of the IPD testing method. One comment stated that the action spectrum for the
IPD response is flat and quite dissimilar from the action spectrum for damage to the skin from ultraviolet light for
erythema, skin cancer, or photoaging of the skin. The comment contended that the IPD response has not been demonstrated
to be a direct or surrogate endpoint for biological damage and, therefore, there is no relationship between a product's
ability to prevent IPD and to prevent damage to the skin. The comment added that IPD has been shown to be unstable, variable,
and nonlinear. Another comment stated that the IPD reaction shows nonreciprocal behavior, i.e., the severity of
the reaction depends upon the time taken to deliver a certain dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment noted that there are two methods of assessing UVA protection that are referred to as IPD. The comment stated
that these two methods differ in the amount of energy needed to produce a response and the time after irradiation at
which the endpoint is read. In one method, the response is read at 45 seconds after exposure. This response is transient
and has been shown to be highly variable and nonreproducible. The response is oxygen-dependent and can only be elicited
in darker skin types. In the second method, the response is read at 2 to 4 hours after exposure and uses a much higher dose
of UVA. The test causes a persistent pigment response in the skin that may last up to several hours. The comment maintained
that the action spectrum for the persistent pigment endpoint has been neither determined nor published.

The comment argued that the threshold problem of not having a truly solar UVA-only light source further complicates
the results obtained using either IPD method. The comment contended that even filtered Xenon lamps contain significant
amounts of visible radiation which, while not harmful to the skin, may cause the IPD reaction to occur. The comment
pointed out that a sunscreen's ability to block visible light should not be confused or combined with its ability to
provide UVA protection. In addition, the comment argued that the light sources used for both IPD methods lack significant
energy in the shorter UVA wavelengths, which are present in sunlight and which are responsible for the preponderance
of UVA damage to the skin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stating that there is great demand among the ``sunbather'' population for a ``great looking'' tan and for an indicator
to predict how good a tan can be obtained with a product, one comment argued that tanning tests like the IPD are not appropriate
for measurement of the damage caused by UVA radiation. The comment contended that measures of melanogenesis would
be misinterpreted by consumers as indicators of efficacy of tanning and that consumers would soon be choosing products
with the lowest IPD rating to help get the deepest tan.

One comment recommended that the agency adopt the Protection Factor in UVA (PFA) test method (Refs. 24, 25, and 26).
This method is similar to the SPF testing procedures with a modification to the light source to virtually eliminate
UVB radiation and thus expose subjects to UVA radiation (greater than 99 percent). The PFA test uses subjects with
skin types I, II, and III. The UVA source is a continuous UVA spectrum (preferably xenon arc) filtered with a 3-mm Schott
WG335 filter that eliminates 99 percent of the UVB radiation, with less than 1,500 W per square meter (W/m2) irradiance.
UVA exposures are delivered at 25-percent increments to skin above and below the expected UVA protection level of
the sunscreen product times the minimal response dose. The endpoints measured in this testing method are delayed
erythema or tanning, whichever is present, observed 16 to 24 hours after UV exposure. The comment stated that these
acute responses have similar action spectra to the chronic action spectra for nonmelanoma skin cancer (as determined
in animals), solar elastosis, and skin wrinkling. The comment added that the data indicate equivalent results with
either response parameter. Minimal response doses are elicited with UVA exposure ranging from approximately 80
to 250 J/cm2. The PFA is the ratio of the minimal response dose on protected skin to the minimal response dose on unprotected
skin.

The comment submitted the results of a multicenter evaluation of sunscreens using PFA methodology (Ref. 25). Sunscreens
containing 2 or 5 percent oxybenzone, 7 percent padimate O, and a placebo were tested in five laboratories using a PFA
protocol. All the solar simulators had intrinsic UV reflecting/IR absorbing dichroic mirrors and were fitted with
Schott 3-mm WG335 and 1-mm UG11 filters. The comment stated that the PFA test method yielded reproducible results
between test centers and was capable of distinguishing between the three levels of UVA protection provided by the
placebo sunscreen and the sunscreens containing 2- or 5-percent oxybenzone. The test was incapable of distinguishing
between the UVA protection provided by the placebo and the 7-percent padimate O (a strong UVB absorber with little
UVA absorbency). The comment stated that these results indicate that the PFA test method is not influenced by the presence
of a strong UVB blocker in the formulation and is specific in identifying UVA protection. The comment added that the
data show that the level of irradiance of the light sources (i.e., 300 to 1,200 W/m2) did not influence the protection
factors of the sunscreens.

Two comments stated that testing procedures using modified lamps that produce mostly UVA wavelengths are unsatisfactory
for evaluating the UVA protection afforded by a sunscreen drug product because the filters required for such testing
can remove 40 percent or more of the critical, damaging wavelengths between 320 and 340 nm. In addition, the comments
pointed out that some of these modified lamps contain UVB wavelengths below 320 nm that can overwhelm UVA effects.
However, another comment stated that PFA values obtained using modified lamps and delayed tanning or erythema as
endpoints weigh the UVA II (320 to 340 nm) heavily and, for the most part, ignore the contribution of the longer UVA wavelengths
(360 to 400 nm). One comment stated that failure of reciprocity may occur with very long exposures and that making each
test exactly the same for each differently configured UV source used and its particular energy distribution would
be impossible. Another comment stated that dose reciprocity for the endpoints of delayed tanning or erythema has
been reported to fail at irradiances between 10 and 50 milliwatts per cm

 and below. One comment noted that the interval after exposure at which the responses are evaluated can bias the results.
The comment added that the infrared energy or heat delivered to the skin during these exposures can affect and alter
the results.

The comment stated that no currently existing lamps accurately and fully reproduce the UVA spectrum of sunlight.
Pure UVA I lamps, e.g., the UVASUN series, are used primarily for photochemotherapy where only longer wave UVA (above
340 nm) is wanted. Xenon arc lamps modified with a WG345 filter are deficient in UVA energy below 335 nm and do not accurately
reflect the energies or damage risk of natural sunlight UVA. According to the comment, such lamps remove too much of
the energy at the short end of the spectrum and result in overestimating the UVA effectiveness of sunscreens. Xenon
arc lamps filtered with 1- or 2-mm WG335 filters contain UVB wavelengths below 320 nm and thus can greatly affect test
results. Thicker WG335 filters cut off too much lower UVA energy to accurately represent UVA risk.

One comment submitted a method that assesses the attenuation of the incident solar radiation on human skin by a sunscreen
(Ref. 27). This method utilizes the principles of diffuse reflectance and fluorescence excitation spectroscopy.
The method directly measures the optical properties of the skin decoupled from its biological responses. Both procedures
are based on the same principle, any modification of the surface of the skin will produce changes in its absorption
properties. Application of a sunscreen modifies the surface of the skin by providing an additional barrier through
which solar radiation must penetrate before reaching the skin. Measurement of the absorption properties of the skin
before and after sunscreen application yields the transmission spectrum of the product and permits calculation
of it solar protection value for the wavelength range investigated. The comment stated that, because this method
allows repetitive testing, evaluations of substantivity and water resistance are possible. The comment contended
that, because the testing is done on human skin, questions of binding, distribution, and photodegradation can be
answered. In addition, the comment maintained that this testing procedure, like the Diffey and Robson method (Ref.
12), does not suffer from a lack of dose reciprocity, as observed with UVA-induced acute skin reactions. The comment
concluded that this procedure allows for the correct estimation of the attenuating power of a sunscreen; thus, the
protection potential of products in sunlight will be correctly estimated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that five environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of permits to allow the field testing of
genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion that the field
testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating a plant
pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of no significant
impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact statements need
not be prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).

In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assessed the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of prescribed fire, timber harvest, reforestation, and road construction in the southern tributary drainages of
the West Fork of the Bitterroot River. A proposal to determine the effects on and response of three sensitive plant
species to prescribed fire is also proposed and will be analyzed. The area is located approximately 50 miles southwest
of Hamilton, Montana, Bitterroot National Forest, West Fork Ranger District, Ravalli County, Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal's actions to use prescribed fire, harvest timber, construct roads, perform reforestation, and monitor
the effects of fire on listed sensitive plant species are being considered together because they represent either
connected or cumulative actions as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25). The purposes
of the project are (1) to maintain or restore ecosystem diversity, function, and health, (2) to provide raw materials
for timber products for the citizens of the United States, and (3) to monitor the effects of fire on plants that are currently
listed as ``sensitive'' by the Regional Forester. This project-level EIS will tier to the Bitterroot National Forest
Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan) and Final EIS (September, 1987), which provides overall guidance
of all land management activities on the Bitterroot National Forest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Prescribed burning and timber harvest are proposed on approximately 3600 acres and 1600 acres, respectively. Timber
harvest is proposed on lands which have been designated as suitable for timber management by the Bitterroot Forest
Plan, with some isolated exceptions designed to maintain ponderosa pine on some sites. This aspect of the proposed
action would require a site specific amendment to the Forest Plan to change the standard for harvest on unsuitable
lands. The timber harvest operations and general administration of National Forest lands would require construction
of approximately three miles of new road and less than one mile of temporary road. The study to determine effects caused
by fire on three species of sensitive plants will delineate plant populations to be exposed to prescribed fire and
delineate plant populations of the same species which would be protected from fire and which would act as controls.

An analysis of the Beaver Woods area shows a marked change in how the forest vegetation currently looks and functions
compared to the past. Natural patterns and stand structures have changed, largely due to effective fire suppression.
Forested areas once diverse in age classes and species are trending toward larger, denser, and more uniform blocks
of climax species. The primary purpose of prescribed fire and timber harvest in the Beaver Woods area is to respond
to the need to maintain or restore ecosystem diversity, function, and health. Another purpose of timber harvest is
to provide raw materials to the timber industry and help satisfy the American public's need for timber products. The
purpose of road construction is to facilitate access to some of the timber stands to be harvested. The purpose of treating
some sensitive plant populations with prescribed fire is to learn more about these species. They are believed to have
developed adaptations to periodic fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project area encompasses approximately 37,000 acres of National Forest land located in T3S, R23W, Sec. 15, 20&hyph;29,
and 33&hyph;36; T3S, R22W, Sec. 3, 9&hyph;11, 14&hyph;17, and 19&hyph;36, T4S, R23W, Sec. 1&hyph;3, 11 and 12, and
T4S, R22W, Sec. 1&hyph;12, 14&hyph;22, 28, and 29, P.M. MT. Proposed activities are scattered throughout the project
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made in what, if anything, should be done in the Beaver Woods area to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Maintain and restore a level of vegetation diversity in the project area that more closely approximates the historic
condition,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Amend the Forest Plan on a site specific basis to allow improvement cutting on the unsuitable lands, thereby reducing
tree density and providing for the establishment of ponderosa pine,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of timber and manage Forest lands, and (d) learn more about
how some plants respond to fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bitterroot Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The area of proposed timber harvest
would occur within Management Areas 1, 2, and 3A. Timber harvest would occur primarily on suitable timber land, with
some isolated exceptions which are proposed in order to help provide for the establishment of ponderosa pine. Prescribed
burning is proposed on lands within Forest Plan Management Areas 1, 2, 3a, 3b and 5. Road construction would occur in
Management Area 1. A brief description of the applicable management direction follows:

The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities would be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations
for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource
values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and scheduled activities on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis
of site-specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness.

Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7),
which will occur during March and April, 1994. In addition, the public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials
at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments,
and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested
in or affected by the proposed action. No additional public meetings are scheduled at this time.

1. How would the proposed timber harvest change the undeveloped character of ``defacto'' roadless lands adjacent
to the Allen Mountain Roadless Area (No. 01946)?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How would the proposed activities affect Forest Service Region 1 listed sensitive species known to inhabit the
area, such as bull trout?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How would the proposed activities affect the movement through the area and potential for habitation by species
that no longer inhabit the area, such as grizzly bears?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Can the vegetation diversity and ecological purposes of the project be met without any further timber harvesting
or road building?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. To what degree would the proposed activities contribute to the spread of noxious weeds in the area?

Other issues commonly associated with prescribed fire, timber harvesting, and road construction include: effects
on cultural resources, water quality, soils, old growth, and scenery values. This list may be verified, expanded,
or modified based on public scoping for this proposal.

The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in August of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is very important that those interested in management of the Beaver Woods area participate at that time. To be most
helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as site-specific as possible. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed
in February, 1995.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day scoping comment period so that substantive comments
and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in developing issues and alternatives.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On April 23, 1987, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a countervailing duty order on certain fresh
cut flowers from Peru (52 FR 13491). The Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review
of this countervailing duty order for at least four consecutive annual anniversary months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of
interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or
no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Accordingly,
as required by &sect;355.25(d)(4) of the Department's regulations, we are notifying the public of our intent to revoke
this order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Opportunity To Object 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Not later than 30 days after the publication date of this notice, domestic interested parties, as defined in &sect;355.2(i)(3),
(i)(4), (i)(5), and (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, may object to the Department's intent to revoke this
countervailing duty order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven copies of any such objections should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no interested parties request an administrative review (pursuant to the Department's notice of opportunity to
request administrative review), or if no domestic interested parties object to the Department's intent to revoke
pursuant to this notice, we shall conclude that the order is no longer of interest to interested parties and shall proceed
with the revocation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 21, 1992, the Department of Commerce issued the final results of its administrative review of the antidumping
duty order on cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from the Federal Republic of Germany. We conducted this antidumping
duty administrative review pursuant to a remand order from the U.S. Court of International Trade in

Krupp Stahl, A.G., et al.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
United States 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Slip Op. 91&hyph;31, April 19, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In that decision, the court ruled that the Department had illegally applied its automatic assessment regulation
to Krupp's December 1982 through June 1983 entries because the original less-than-fair-value-investigation was
initiated prior to the October 30, 1984, amendment to the Tariff Act of 1930 and prior to the October 22, 1986, amendment
to the effective date provision of the 1984 Act. Because the 1984 and 1986 amendments are not retroactive, the court
held that Krupp was entitled to an automatic review of its entries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review covers one manufacturer/exporter of subject merchandise, Krupp Stahl, A.G., and the period December
17, 1982 through June 23, 1983. The final margin is 27 percent. The final results of this review were affirmed by the
Court on May 26, 1993, in

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 7, 1991, the Department of Commerce published the preliminary results of its administrative review of
the antidumping duty order on cold-rolled stainless steel sheet from the Federal Republic of Germany (56 FR 56976).
We have conducted this antidumping duty administrative review pursuant to a remand order from the U.S. Court of International
Trade in

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 7, 1991, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 56976) the preliminary results of its administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain cold-rolled
stainless steel sheet from Germany (48 FR 28680, June 23, 1983). In the notice of preliminary results of review, we
noted that Krupp Stahl, A.G. (Krupp), failed to respond to our questionnaire issued in July 1991. On September 12,
1991, Krupp advised us that in 1989 it had destroyed the records for the December 1982&hyph;June 1983 review period,
because German law does not require that business records be retained beyond a minimum period of time. In addition,
we noted that after searching our files we were only able to locate the public version of the narrative portion of Krupp's
responses to the Department's original and supplemental questionnaires issued in 1983 and 1984. Because that information
was insufficient for purposes of conducting an administrative review and because Krupp did not respond to our questionnaire
because it had destroyed all supporting documentation, we used the best information available (BIA) for the preliminary
results of review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to publication of the notice of preliminary results, we discovered a few boxes labeled with the administrative
proceeding number relevant to this case in an annex to the Department's Central Records storeroom. We notified the
parties to the proceeding of our discovery and suspended the briefing and hearing schedule until the Department could
thoroughly review all the documents contained in those boxes to determine which, if any, might be relevant to the instant
period of review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documents represented submissions from the original less than fair value (LTFV) investigation, and from the
first and second administrative reviews. They contained information from other German producers as well as from
Krupp. There were three computer tapes in the boxes. We were able to read two of the tapes which contained data relevant
to the LTFV investigation. The third tape could not be formatted based on any of the formatting instructions provided
in either the LTFV or first review questionnaire and supplemental responses, indicating that the tape did not pertain
to the information contained in those responses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon its review of all of the documents found in the Central Records annex, the Department determined that the
information either pertained to a different company, covered an irrelevant time period, or was not in a useable computer
format for purposes of conducting a dumping analysis. On March 2, 1991, the Department contacted counsel for Krupp
and counsel for the Petitioner to inform them of the results of our examination of the information. At that time a revised
schedule was outlined to allow adequate time for comments and rebuttal comments. At the request of the respondent,
we held a public hearing on April 14, 1992. The Department has now completed this administrative review in accordance
with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act).

Scope of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the review are shipments of cold-rolled stainless steel sheet whether or not corrugated or crimped
and whether or not pickled; not cut, not pressed and not stamped to non-rectangular shape; not coated or plated with
metal, and under 0.1875 inch in thickness and over 12 inch in width. Until January 1, 1989, this merchandise was classifiable
under item number 607.9020 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). Since that date, this merchandise
is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item numbers 7219.32.00, 7219.33.00, 7219.34.00,
7219.35.00, 7219.90.00, 7220.20.10, and 7220.90.00. Like the TSUSA numbers, the HTS numbers are provided for convenience
and Customs purposes only. The written product description remains dispositive.

Comment 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner notes that Krupp admitted that in 1989 it destroyed all records relevant to the period of review and,
therefore, was unable to respond to the Department's questionnaire issued in July 1991. Because of Krupp's actions,
the petitioner contends that Krupp has significantly impeded the Department's conduct of this review in that the
Department now is unable to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information submitted in Krupp's 1983 and
1984 responses to the Department's earlier questionnaires. Petitioner asserts that destruction of relevant records
during an ongoing judicial proceeding where Krupp was aware that the Court might remand the case to the Department
for administrative review does not, contrary to Krupp's claim, ``demonstrate [&blank;] a willingness'' to cooperate.
Given the circumstances, petitioner argues that the Department is obligated to use BIA based on an adverse inference.

Department's Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 12, 1991, Krupp informed the Department that in 1989 it destroyed all data relevant to the period under
review, because German law does not require that records be maintained for more than five years. Because of its actions,
Krupp stated that it was unable to respond to our July 1991 questionnaire. In addition, Krupp's destruction of its
records prevented the Department from conducting a verification of what few written submissions of factual information
remain in the Department's files from Krupp's 1983 and 1984 submissions. In reviews such as this one, involving old
data, the Department may conduct a verification. See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color from Japan; Final
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 54 FR 13917 (Apr. 6, 1989). In 1988 we verified information covering
the period April 1983 through August 1983 submitted by two companies subject to the Japanese television finding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While German law may prescribe a minimum required period for the retention of business records, it is irrelevant to
the current judicial proceeding. Respondents have a responsibility to maintain documents relevant to ongoing litigation.

, Slip Op. 92&hyph;72 (CIT May 15, 1992) at 19. As a consequence of its actions, Krupp explicitly acknowledges in its
September 12, 1991 letter ``that the Department will be unable to complete the administrative review in the manner
contemplated by the Court of International Trade'' in its remand opinion and recognizes that the Department ``will
thus be forced to use the best information available'' (BIA) for this administrative review. Therefore, pursuant
to 776(c) of the Tariff Act we have continued to use BIA for these final results.

Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Krupp alleges that the Department suggested, and later confirmed, through a memorandum to the file that the Department
had destroyed Krupp's proprietary questionnaire responses submitted in 1983 and 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department did not destroy documents relevant to this period of review. Prior to publication of the preliminary
results of this administrative review, we were unable to locate documents other than written public versions of Krupp's
1983 and 1984 responses to requests for information. Subsequent to publication of the preliminary results of review,
we discovered a few boxes of documents bearing the administrative proceeding number relevant to this case in an annex
to the Central Records storeroom. A thorough review of the information contained in those documents revealed that
it ``pertained either to a different company, an irrelevant period of review, or was in an unusable computerized format
for purposes of a dumping analysis.'' See Memorandum to the File from Jackie Johnson, Case Analyst, dated March 2,
1991. Other than indicating what the Department was ultimately able to locate in its files, the memorandum contains
no statement that any of Krupp's files were destroyed, nor does the memorandum contain any implication that this was
done. Accordingly, contrary to Krupp's allegations, the memorandum does not support the contention that the Department
destroyed any documents whatsoever.

Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Krupp argues that the statutory language and legislative history of sections 776(b) and (c) of the Tariff Act explicitly
prohibit the Department from using information submitted in support of a petition as BIA in an administrative review.
Krupp contends that petition information may only be used for purposes of a final BIA determination in an investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner supports the Department's use of an adverse BIA rate based on information from the petition arguing
that the Department's regulations not only allow the Department the discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis,
what is the best information available, but explicitly allow for the use of information submitted in support of a petition
as BIA. See 19 CFR 353.37.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not agree with Krupp's interpretation that either the statute or its legislative history prohibits the Department
from using the information submitted in support of a petition as BIA for the margin in an administrative review. While
section 776(b) of the Tariff Act indicates that the Department ``may'' use information from the petition as a basis
for a final determination in an investigation, this section contains no prohibition, explicit or otherwise, against
using such information as a basis for the final results of an administrative review. Indeed, section 776(c) of the
Tariff Act explicitly states that, in making its ``determinations under this [sub]title,'' the Department ``shall,
whenever a party *&blank;*&blank;* refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in
the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, use the best information otherwise available.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 determinations made under Subtitle IV of the Tariff Act, places no limitations on the use of information from the petition
for purposes of making a final BIA determination in an administrative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the legislative history of the 1984 amendments to section 776 of the Tariff Act places no limitations on
the Department's use of petition information for the purposes of making BIA determinations. The House Report confirms
that ``[a]s under present law, the administering authority will use the best information available to it for its action
if it is unable to verify the accuracy of the information submitted.'' H.R. Rep. No. 98&hyph;725, 98th Cong., 2d Sess.
43 (1984). The Conference Report is even more clear that the permissive nature of the statutory language does not prohibit
the use of petition information for BIA purposes in administrative review:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The express reference in the statute to the use of information submitted in support of the petition as the best information
available for purposes of final determinations in investigations should not be interpreted as precluding the administering
authority from using the best information available for purposes of administrative reviews.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conf. Rep. No. 98&hyph;1156, 98th Cong., 2d. Sess. 177 (1984). As is evident from the legislative history as well,
in giving the Department permissive use to employ petition information for BIA purposes in a final determination
in an investigation, Congress was careful not to place any prohibitions on the use of BIA information for purposes
of administrative reviews, including the use of information submitted in support of a petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Krupp's forced interpretation of the statutory language, the Department could not even use petition information
as a basis for a preliminary BIA determination in an investigation. Such interpretation would render the Department
powerless to secure the cooperation required to conduct investigations and administrative reviews. However, the
Court, in

Accordingly, based on the plain language of the statute, a clear reading of the legislative history, and mindful of
relevant Court opinions on the application of the BIA provision of the statute, the Department must reject Krupp's
interpretation as contrary to all three. We conclude, therefore, that there is no legal basis which would prevent
the Department from using petition information for purposes of the final results of the administrative review in
question.

Comment 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Krupp also claims that the Department's use of information submitted in support of the petition as BIA for this administrative
review is an unprecedented departure from Department practice. Krupp contends that the Department has clearly and
repeatedly stated that its policy is to use as BIA the higher of the highest rate for any firm: in the current review;
a previous review; or the final LTFV determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Krupp notes that in Replacement Parts for Self-Propelled Bituminous Paving Equipment From Canada; Final Results
of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 47451 (September 19, 1991) (Canadian Paving Equipment), the Department
discussed that in the preliminary results of review that it had the authority to consider petition information as
BIA. However, the Department rejected the petition information for purposes of BIA in the final results of review,
despite the respondent's repeated failure to respond to the Department's requests for information. Citing industrial
Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From the Federal Republic of Germany; Preliminary
Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 2500 (January 23, 1991) (German Belts), Krupp contends
that the Department's statement that it preliminarily used a rate from the petition as BIA is misleading, because
the rate used is actually the margin from the final determination of the fair value investigation.

Department's Position
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: As we stated in Canadian Paving Parts, ``because each investigation and administrative review present the Department
with a unique set of facts and circumstances, the Department often must select an appropriate unique BIA rate to achieve
the purpose'' of the statute.

. at 47453. See also Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review; Steel Jacks from Canada, 52 FR 32957
(Sept. 1, 1987) (``Selection of the best information is made on a case-by-case basis.'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Canadian Paving Parts we selected a less adverse BIA for the final results of review rather than a higher rate based
on information submitted in support of the petition because the respondent had made several attempts to cooperate
with our requests. However, the only reason the Department decided not to use the petition-based rate for the final
results of the review was because the respondent made some attempt to cooperate, not because the Department determined
it was legally precluded from doing so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to Krupp's assertions, the Department has used petition-based rates as BIA in numerous administrative
reviews. For example, in the administrative review of Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings)
and Parts Thereof from Germany, 56 FR 31692 (July 11, 1991) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
AFBs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), we applied the most adverse BIA to companies who refused to respond to the Department's questionnaire or otherwise
significantly impeded the conduct of the administrative review. While the notice of final results indicated that
the rate used as BIA was the highest rate from the final determination of sales at LTFV, the final LTFV determination
notice clearly stated that the information used as BIA for that determination had been submitted in support of the
petition. Also, in Cellular Mobile Telephones and Subassemblies from Japan; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative
Review, 54 FR 48011 (Nov. 20, 1989) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
CMTs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and in Industrial Belts and Components and Parts Thereof, Whether Cured or Uncured, From the Federal Republic of
Germany; Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review, 56 FR 9673 (Mar. 7, 1991) (German Belts), we used,
as BIA, margins from the final LTFV determinations, which were based on information submitted in support of the original
petitions. See CMTs final LTFV determination, 50 FR 45447 (Oct. 31, 1985), and German Belts final LTFV determination,
54 FR 15505 (Apr. 18, 1989), respectively.

Comment 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Citing Rhone Poulenc, where the Court found that it is an acceptable interpretation of the best information statute
that the Department can presume that the highest prior margin is the most probative of current margins in BIA situations,
Krupp asserts that the Department may only consider prior margins for purposes of BIA. Krupp argues that, because
the petition-based BIA preliminary determination rate was superseded by a final calculated determination rate
in the LTVF investigation, the preliminary LTFV rate ``is not a prior margin'' and thus may not be used as BIA for the
final results of this administrative review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Krupp argues that the Department itself declared the rates established in this preliminary determination
``no longer in effect,'' in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Certain Stainless Steel Sheet
and Strip Products from the Federal Republic of Germany, 48 FR 20459 (May 6, 1983). Krupp goes on to argue that the Court
in Krupp I would have found Krupp's challenge to the Department's petition-based preliminary BIA margin to be ripe
for review if the Court thought that the preliminary determination ``could determine the final liquidation rate
for Krupp's entries, notwithstanding a final determination.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitioner states that application of the 27 percent rate in this case represents a reasonable exercise of the
Department's discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, what is the best information available. The Petitioner
argues that 19 CFR 353.37(b) provides for the use of petition information as BIA. The Petitioner further contends
that, as discussed in Rhone Poulenc, the statute provides for the Department to presume that the highest prior margin
is the most probative when a company is non-responsive to the Department's requests for information, otherwise,
the respondent would have provided current information demonstrating that the current margin is less. The Petitioner
argues that such a presumption must exist here since the respondent failed to comply with the Department's request
for information and in fact destroyed all the records pertaining to the instant period of review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Department's Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We disagree with Krupp's contentions that, in an LTFV investigation, a preliminary determination rate based upon
the best information available_in this instance from information submitted in support of the petition_is not a legitimate
margin and, thus, cannot be a ``prior margin'' which may serve as the basis for a final rate in an administrative review.
To the contrary, an affirmative preliminary BIA rate, even if based on information submitted in support of the petition,
results in the suspension of liquidation and the collection of cash deposits or bond. See section 733(d)(2) of the
Tariff Act. In addition, in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
712 F. Supp. 931 (CIT 1989), the Court upheld the Department's determination that an LTFV preliminary margin serves
as a provisional measures rate cap, with respect to merchandise entered between the dates of the preliminary and final
determinations. See section 737(a) of the Tariff Act. In fact, because of the importance of the preliminary margin,
the Department has promulgated regulations providing for the correction of clerical errors in preliminary determinations
of sales at LTFV. See 57 FR 1131 (Jan. 10, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, a preliminary margin, whether it is a calculated rate or is a petition-based BIA rate, has legal force and effect.
As such, it serves as a ``prior margin'' to the same extent as a final margin. In this respect, Krupp's reliance on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rhone Poulenc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is misplaced. While the Federal Circuit did state that ``it reflects a common sense inference that the highest prior
margin is the most probative evidence of the current margins,'' 899 F.2. at 1190, it placed absolutely no qualifications
on what constituted the ``highest prior margin.'' The Court went on the explain that if this common sense inference
were not so, ``the [respondent], knowing of the rule, would have produced 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
current
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 information showing the margin to be less.''

 (emphasis in original).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding its interpretation of the statutory language and legislative history, even Krupp admits that information
submitted in support of the petition can be used as a BIA rate for an administrative review. See Public Hearing Transcript
(Apr. 14, 1992) (Transcript) at 42&hyph;43. Krupp, however, attempts to qualify the use of such information by arguing
that the petition-based BIA rate must also be the final determination rate of the LTFV investigation. In other words,
if the preliminary determination is a BIA rate based on information from the petition but is ``carried forward'' to
the final determination, then it becomes a ``prior margin.'' Transcript at 43. Once this has occurred, then according
to Krupp, the petition-based BIA rate may serve as the basis for a BIA rate in an administrative review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Such reasoning, however, is based on the faulty premise that a preliminary margin is not a ``real'' margin, and thus
cannot be a ``prior margin.'' However, as explained above, a preliminary margin is an actual margin to which legal
consequences attach and, thus, is as much a ``prior margin'' as the rate for the final determination. Thus, Krupp's
``carried forward'' theory must be rejected as being without legal foundation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, contrary to Krupp's contentions, the final LTFV determination margin is no more representative of the period
under review than is the preliminary margin. Both of these margins are based upon information which relates to a period
prior to the period of review. Indeed, in this instance because Krupp failed to respond to the Department's information
request, it has not demonstrated that the final determination rate is any more probative of the period under review
than the preliminary rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Rhone Poulenc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 899 F. Supp. at 1190. As such, there is no record evidence to show that one is more or less probative than the other as
to what the actual dumping margins would be for the period of review. This then is the reason for undertaking an administrative
review, i.e., to analyze information concerning the actual entries for the review period so that any duties that might
be assessed on those entries would have been based on the actual data relating to those entries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, when the administrative review process is thwarted, as it has been in this case by Krupp's failure to provide
information about the entries subject to review, then the Department is forced to rely upon the best information available.
Under these circumstances the court has clearly ruled that ``Commerce may exercise discretion in determining what
is the best information available when a [respondent] has failed to supply requested information.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

had it been able to divine the particular circumstance of this review are also misplaced. In fact, there is nothing
in the Court's opinion even to suggest that it would have considered Krupp's challenge to the preliminary determination
ripe for review if it had known that margin would be used as a BIA margin in the first administrative review because of
Krupp's failure to comply with the Department's information request. To the contrary, after reviewing the facts
surrounding the preliminary determination, the Court found that ``the deposit of estimated duties will not cause
a hardship of the type which justifies judicial intrusion into an ongoing administrative investigation.''

Krupp I

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason the Court found no hardship to Krupp is that the preliminary margin is simply an estimate of the potential
duties owed_it does not represent an assessment rate for purposes of liquidation. Under the statutory scheme, all
of Krupp's entries subsequent to the date of the preliminary LTFV determination would only be liquidated at a rate
determined on the basis of an administrative review of those entries. If that assessment rate were determined to be
higher than the preliminary LTFV rate, Krupp would not be required to pay the difference. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thus, any so-called ``hardship'' that purportedly has befallen Krupp is of its own making by virtue of its failure
to comply with the Department's information request, thereby resulting in the assigning of an adverse BIA rate for
the entries subject to review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Petitioner recites the history of this litigation highlighting that, in its Motion for Summary Judgment, Krupp
asked the Court, among other alternative prayers for relief, to enjoin liquidation of the December 1982 through May
1983 entries while directing the Department to conduct an administrative review of those entries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Court did not grant Krupp's request for a 7.76 percent liquidation rate, but rather instructed the Department
to conduct an administrative review, the Petitioner asserts that Krupp's actions have simply been an attempt to manipulate
the outcome of the administrative review process. The Petitioner concludes that if the Department were to apply the
7.76 percent rate as BIA in these final results, the respondent would in effect be rewarded for its lack of cooperation.

 Because Krupp failed to respond to our most recent questionnaire and destroyed its business documents, thus precluding

The Department will instruct the U.S. Customs Service to assess antidumping duties on all entries of this merchandise

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting competitive
applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) program. The total cost of performance for the
first budget period (12 months) from August 1, 1994 to July 31, 1995 is estimated at $169,125. The application must
include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing contributions
may be in the form of cash contributions, client fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof. The MBDC will
operate in the Beaumont-Port Arthur, Texas geographic service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to any one evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project costs through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites interested parties to participate in a cooperative
research consortium to assess the performance of air speed calibration facilities and establish realistic traceability
for the participants. The calibration of anemometers is critical to ventilation measurements in the HVAC and related
industries. Presently, anemometers are calibrated by both instrument manufacturers and users alike in a wide variety
of facilities employing different methods. In most cases, both manufacturers and users establish traceability
to a central laboratory such as NIST. However, there are indications that there may be variations as large as plus or
minus 15% among the calibration measurements being made due to a lack of standard calibration technique. Measurements
are considered traceable to designated standards if scientifically rigorous evidence is produced to show that the
measurement process is producing measurement results for which the total measurement uncertainty relative to the
designated standards is quantified. Realistic traceability to national standards for flow measurement can be obtained
using a round-robin testing program, which produces reasonable estimates of systematic errors for a measurement
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the consortium is to devise an appropriate test and set the conditions so that test results quantify
the performance of anemometer calibration facilities, operated by both instrument manufacturers and users, using
a round-robin testing program. The participating members will choose instruments and test conditions so that they
are compatible with typical situations used in their facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program is being undertaken within the scope and confines of The Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Public
Law 99&hyph;502, 15 U.S.C. 3710a), which provides federal laboratories including NIST, with the authority to enter
into cooperative research agreements with qualified parties. Under this law, NIST may contribute personnel, equipment
and facilities, but not direct funding.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP) is a six-agency effort that includes the Departments of Defense, Commerce,
Energy and Transportation, the National Science Foundation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
It was formed to execute eight statutory programs enacted by Congress in the Defense Technology Conversion, Reinvestment,
and Transition Act of 1992. These eight programs have common requirements, including participation by ``partnerships,''
cost sharing between those partnerships and the Federal Government, and a focus on assisting small businesses and
defense-dependent businesses. It is the continuing mission of the TRP to stimulate the transition to a growing, integrated,
national industrial capability which provides the most advanced, affordable, military systems and the most competitive
commercial products. TRP programs are structured to expand opportunities in commercial and dual-use United States
industries and demonstrably enhance U.S. competitiveness.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of Army (DA) prepared a Draft Environmental
Impact Statement (DEIS) to evaluate alternatives for future family housing development for Fort McCoy, Wisconsin.
Approximately 16 units are proposed for construction in fiscal year 1994. Additional units may be constructed as
required, with the total constructed over a 20-year period not to exceed 374 units. The facilities are needed to replace
existing substandard family housing on-post and an inadequate supply of rental units in the surrounding communities.
The DEIS evaluates three alternatives:

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between VA and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are VA delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by VA so as to permit VA to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset procedures
under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DoD and VA have concluded an agreement
to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal data
between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within the
Federal government so that VA can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or salary
offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.

Participating agencies: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in this computer matching program are the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Defense Manpower
Data Center (DMDC) of the Department of Defense (DoD). The VA is the source agency, i.e., the activity disclosing the
records for the purpose of the match. The DMDC is the specific recipient activity or matching agency, i.e., the agency
that actually performs the computer matching.

Purpose of the match: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the execution of this agreement, VA will provide and disclose debtor records to DMDC to identify and locate any
Federal personnel, employed or retired, who may owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government under certain programs
administered by VA. VA will use this information to initiate independent collection of those debts under the provisions
of the Debt Collection Act when voluntary payment is not forthcoming. These collection efforts will include requests
by VA of the employing agency to apply administrative and/or salary offset procedures until such time as the obligation
is paid in full.

Description of Computer Matching Program: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VA, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a magnetic tape which contains the names of delinquent debtors in programs
VA administers. Upon receipt of the computer tape file of debtor accounts, DMDC will perform a computer match using
all nine digits of the SSN of the VA file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC database, established under an interagency
agreement between DoD, OPM, OMB and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records of Federal employees
and military members, active and retired. Matching records (`hits'), based on the SSN, will produce the member's
name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work or home address. The hits or matches will be furnished
to VA. VA is responsible for verifying and determining that the data on the DMDC reply tape file are consistent with
VA's source file and for resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies on an individual basis. VA will also be responsible
for making final determinations as to positive identification, amount of indebtedness and recovery efforts as a
result of the match. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The magnetic computer tape provided by VA will contain data elements of the debtor's name, SSN, internal account numbers
and the total amount owed by approximately 450,000 delinquent debtors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 10 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government-wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMDC will match the SSNs on the VA tape by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records, hits based on SSN's,
will produce data elements of the individual's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home address.

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between VA and DoD, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.

PROJECT SCOPE: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This grant was awarded September 15, 1989, in response to DOE Program Solicitation No. DE-PSO5&hyph;89ER80688,
and was renewed on March 15, 1991, and December 15, 1992, for a second and third year, respectively. The grantee will
continue to provide assistance to recipients of SBIR Phase II awards in preparing business plans and business opportunity
presentations, and in presenting these materials to potential sponsors in a Commercialization Opportunity Forum.
Each company will also be provided with several contacts of prospective value. A secondary objective is to have these
same companies well enough prepared so that they can pursue cooperative and other financial agreements with parties
outside the Forum. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7, it has been determined that the activity to be funded is necessary
for the satisfactory completion of an activity that will enhance the public benefit derived and for which competition
would have a significant adverse effect on completion of the activity. Dawnbreaker has developed an exclusive capability
to perform the requisite training, both through its prior experience and through the training methods and tools developed
under the initial grant. Also, the rights to intellectual property developed under this project pass to Dawnbreaker
under the regulations which apply to small business. Eligibility for renewal of this award is, therefore, restricted
to Dawnbreaker.

The DOE announces that it plans to award a renewal research grant to the South Carolina State University (SCSU), 300
University Avenue, NE, Orangeburg, South Carolina. The grant entitled, ``Comparative Effects of Carbon Dioxide
Enrichment and pH Change on Phytoplankton Communities in Savannah River Site Carolina Bay Restoration Effects'',
will be awarded for a two-year project period at a DOE funding level of $211,827. Funds of $105,342 will be awarded for
the first budget period, and subject to the availability of funds, the remainder will be awarded for the second budget
period. Pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) of the DOE Assistance Regulations (10 CFR part 600), DOE has determined
that the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of an activity presently being funded by
DOE and eligibility for this renewal award shall be limited to SCSU.

Project Scope:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the past four years, SCSU has conducted phytoplankton research in Carolina Bay ecosystems on the Savannah
River Site. The renewal will provide a better understanding of what effect nutrient enrichment (fertilizing during
wetlands restoration) has on phytoplankton communities and the relative use of atmospheric CO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 derived from in-situ decomposition by phytoplankton in Carolina bays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCSU is a Historically Black University and falls within the meaning and intent of Executive Orders 12320, 12677,
and 12876 pertaining to Federal assistance to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The participation
of HBCUs in federally supported research is relatively limited. In order to overcome some of these limitations, Executive
Orders directed Federal agencies to increase the participation of HBCUs in federally-funded programs and to strengthen
their capabilities to provide quality education. This award represents an effort to strengthen the HBCU community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has determined that this award to SCSU on a noncompetitive basis is appropriate.

This filing requests approval of the assignment, and Ocean State's acceptance thereof, by Newport Electric Corporation
(Newport) of all of its rights and obligations under its unit power agreement (the ``Agreement'') with Ocean State

under the Agreement to Montaup, such assignment to become effective on the FERC-allowed effective date for Montaup's
modified all-requirements wholesale tariff, filed on March 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This application has been accepted for filing and was previously noticed as ready for environmental analysis. Comments,
recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment were not solicited, however,
because we had not decided on whether the data and results from the entrainment studies completed for the Rothschild
Project No. 2212, Centralia Project No. 2255, and Wisconsin River Division Project No. 2590 could be extrapolated
to an environmental analysis of this project. We have determined that the data and results for the three other projects
can be extrapolated to this project. Therefore, we now request comments, recommendations, terms and conditions,
or prescriptions pertaining to entrainment for this project.

Description of Project: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project structures consist of earth dikes, a powerhouse, and a Taintor gate spillway. Earth dikes on each side
of the concrete powerhouse/spillway structure, constructed of poorly graded sands and gravelly sands, are up to
30 feet high and have a total length of 1,190 feet. The 190.6 foot wide powerhouse/spillway structure includes three
20-foot-wide by 15-foot-high Taintor gates and four 22.5-foot-wide intake bays. Three of the intakes are equipped
with twin horizontal turbines (two are connected to 800-Kw generators). The fourth intake is equipped with a vertical
turbine connected to a 300-Kw generator. The applicant proposes to add an 800-Kw generator to the third twin horizontal
turbine. At the normal project headwater elevation of 1,458.4 feet, the reservoir surface area is 1,420 acres and
the storage volume is 18,200 acre feet. Normal head on the turbines is 23 feet.

Description of Project:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The project as licensed consists of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following: (1) An existing dam with a total length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,075 feet which is comprised of (a) an uncontrolled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overflow timber crib spillway which has a length of 638.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feet, a height of about 21 feet, crest elevations of 942.01 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 942.41 feet mean sea level (msl), and which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surmounted by 4.1 foot-high flashboards; (b) a 12-foot-long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonoverflow section between the timber crib spillway and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gated spillway; (c) a gated spillway section which has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length of 110 feet and contains three 17.5-foot-high by 30-foot-wide Taintor gates with a sill elevation of 930.11
feet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
msl; (d) a nonoverflow reinforced concrete/sheet pile wall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section about 30 feet long located between the gated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spillway and the powerhouse; (e) a 146-foot-long powerhouse; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) a water-retaining wall or bulkhead located upstream of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the paper mill which has a length of about 40 feet; and (g) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonoverflow abutment sections; (2) a reservoir with a normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pool elevation of 946.3 feet msl, a surface area of 400 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acres, and a length of about 3 miles; (3) a 146-foot-long by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
97.7-foot-wide powerhouse which contains seven flumes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five turbine/generating units_three are vertical Francis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turbines and two are horizontal ``camel-back'' units_with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined nameplate rating of 3,780 kilowatts (Kw), an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average head of 21.9 feet, and a total hydraulic capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3,225 cubic feet per second (cfs); and (4) appurtenant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project would have no switchyard, switchgear, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmission line included in the project facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the adjoining paper mill would not be a part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the project licensed facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant is not proposing any changes to the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project works as licensed. The Applicant estimates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average annual generation would be 27.3 Gwh and owns all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing project facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing project would also be subject to Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takeover under sections 14 and 15 of the Federal Power Act.

Scoping Process:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In gathering background information for preparation of the Environmental Assessment for the issuance of a Federal
hydropower license, staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, is using a scoping process to identify significant
environmental issues related to the construction and operation or the continued operation of hydropower projects.
The staff will review all issues raised during the scoping process and identify issues deserving of study and also
deemphasize insignificant issues, narrowing the scope of the environmental assessment as well. If preliminary
analysis indicates that any issues presented in the scoping process would have little potential for causing significant
impacts, the issue or issues will be identified and the reasons for not providing a more detailed analysis will be given.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Federal, state, and local resource agencies; licensees, applicants and developers; Indian tribes; other interested
groups and individuals, are requested to forward to the Commission, any information that they believe will assist
the Commission staff in conducting an accurate and thorough analysis of the site-specific and cumulative environmental
effects of the proposed licensing activities of the project(s). Therefore you are requested to provide information
related to the following items:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Information, data, maps or professional opinion that may contribute to defining the geographical and temporal
scope of the analysis and identifying significant environmental issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identification of and information from any other EIS or similar study (previous, on-going, or planned) relevant
to the proposed licensing activities in the subject river basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Existing information and any data that would aid in describing the past and present effects of the project(s)
and other developmental activities on the physical/chemical, biological, and socioeconomic environments. For
example, fish stocking/management histories in the subject river, historic water quality data and the reasons for
improvement or degradation of the quality, any wetland habitat loss or proposals to develop land and water resources
within the basin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Identification of any federal, state or local resource plans and future project proposals that encompass
the subject river or basin. For example, proposals to construct or operate water treatment facilities, recreation
areas, or implement fishery management programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Documentation that would support a conclusion that the project(s) does not contribute, or does contribute
to adverse and beneficial cumulative effects on resources and therefore should be excluded for further study or excluded
from further consideration of cumulative impacts within the river basin. Documentation should include, but not
limited to: How the project(s) interact with other projects within the river basin or other developmental activities;
results from studies; resource management policies; and, reports from federal, state, and local agencies.

Take notice that on March 24, 1994, Mobile Bay Pipeline Company (Mobile Bay), 600 Travis Street, P.O. Box 1478, Houston,
Texas 77251&hyph;1478, filed in Docket No. CP89&hyph;471&hyph;008 a petition to amend the orders issued June 25,
1991 and July 23, 1991, as amended,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act a request to increase the operating pressure of Mobile Bay's pipeline
facilities located in the vicinity of Mobile Bay, Alabama, all as more fully set forth in the petition to amend which
is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

Mobile Bay was formerly Gateway Pipeline Company; See 55 FERC &para;61,488 (1991) and 56 FERC &para;61,109 (1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mobile Bay requests authority to increase the operating pressure of its system from 800 to 892 psig. Mobile Bay states
that this increase in operating pressure will not result in an increase of the pipeline's design capacity. Mobile
Bay states that its maximum operating pressure (MOP) was originally based on the assumption that the maximum pressure
delivered into Koch Gateway Pipeline Company's (Koch Gateway) system would be 700 psig. Mobile Bay states that, at
this time, the MOP of Koch Gateway's transmission line at the Mobile Bay interconnect is 780 psig and that it is necessary
for Koch Gateway to operate at 780 psig in order to move the Mobile Bay volumes out of the area. Mobile Bay states that
utilizing this pressure as the downstream pressure on Mobile Bay, pressure drop calculations result in 892 psig as
the MOP necessary to move Mobile Bay's design capacity of 600 Mmcf of natural gas per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mobile Bay states that it is incapable of creating additional pressure above that provided by its sources, that it
has no compression facilities on its system and that this filing does not propose to add any facilities. Mobile Bay
states that the pressure on the system is dependent upon the discharge pressures of the three processing plants and
other connected supply facilities and that it can only restrict, by use of regulation, operating pressure to something
less than that provided by its sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition to amend should on or before April
20, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on March 22, 1994, Texas Utilities Fuel Company (TUFCO), 400 North Olive Street, Dallas, Texas 75201,
filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;306&hyph;000 a petition for declaratory order requesting that the Commission declare
that TUFCO's transportation and delivery of natural gas to a Hinshaw pipeline that engages in transactions under
an Order No. 63 certificate would not render TUFCO, its facilities, any gas flowing through its facilities or any facilities
or natural gas in the facilities with which TUFCO is interconnected, subject to the Commission's Natural Gas Act (NGA)
jurisdiction, all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TUFCO states that it is an intrastate natural gas pipeline operating solely within the State of Texas. TUFCO further
states that it is presently exempt from NGA jurisdiction by reason of section 1(b) of the NGA (15 U.S.C. 717(b) (1993))
and is an intrastate pipeline under section 2(16) of the NGPA (15 U.S.C. 3301(16) (1982)). TUFCO says that it is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Texas Utilities Company, an investor-owned holding company for an electric utility system. TUFCO's
primary function is to provide a reliable and secure supply of gas to its affiliate, Texas Utilities Electric Company
(TU Electric), an operating electric public utility company, which is regulated by the Public Utility Commission
of Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TUFCO indicates that it purchases gas directly from Texas producers, intrastate pipelines and other marketers of
natural gas in the State of Texas. Gas purchased by TUFCO is delivered into its intrastate pipeline system and is redelivered
to the electric generation stations of TU Electric, it is stated. TUFCO also provides intrastate transportation
services to shippers at times when capacity is available in its system in excess of that required to serve TU Electric.
TUFCO says it does not provide interstate transportation service under NGPA section 311.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TUFCO states that it has been requested by potential shippers to transport gas through its system for delivery to Seagas
Pipeline Company (Seagas). It is further stated that these shippers would then arrange for transportation by Seagas
to markets located within Texas, either directly or through additional interconnecting pipelines. TUFCO submits
that all of the gas transported by TUFCO would be contractually committed to consumers in Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TUFCO says it also desires to exchange gas with Seagas. As proposed, TUFCO would deliver gas to Seagas at various points
on Seagas' system in exchange for a like quantity of gas at other points. However, TUFCO states it would not receive
any interstate gas from Seagas. Each point of redelivery to TUFCO would be from gathering or production facilities
in Texas to ensure that all of the gas received by TUFCO would be intrastate gas, not commingled with the interstate
gas in the Seagas system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TUFCO states that Seagas is a Hinshaw pipeline in Texas, exempt from Commission jurisdiction under NGA section 1(c).
Phillips Natural Gas Company, 43 FERC &para;62,049(1988). TUFCO further states that Seagas also holds an Order No.
63 certificate that allows it to transport gas that will be delivered out of the state of Texas, without losing its NGA
section 1(c) exempt status. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TUFCO says that none of the gas received by TUFCO from Seagas will have been transported in, or commingled with gas transported
in interstate commerce. However, TUFCO states that because the gas delivered by TUFCO to Seagas in each of the above
transactions may be commingled with gas in Seagas's line that will be delivered out-of-state under an Order No. 63
certificate, TUFCO seeks a declaration from the Commission that its transportation of that gas before delivery to
Seagas, or other Hinshaw pipelines under similar circumstances, would not subject TUFCO, its facilities, any gas
transported by TUFCO, or the facilities of others, to NGA jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before April 20, 1994,
file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance
with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211). All protests

to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate

In accordance with FCC rules radio station licensees are required to apply for renewal of their radio station authorization
every five years. The FCC Form 402R was revised to include the Anti-Drug Abuse certification statement, reference
to meters added, deleted two data elements and added two. Commission personnel will use the data to determine eligibility
for a renewal authorization and issue a radio station license. Data is also used by Compliance personnel in conjunction
with field engineers for enforcement purposes.

The collections of information contained in Rulepart 25 are used by Commission staff in carrying out its duties as
set forth in sections 308 and 309 of the Communications Act, to determine the technical, legal and other qualifications
of an applicant to operate a station. The information is used to determine whether the objectives of public interest,
convenience and necessity in accordance with Section 309 of the Act are being met. The Communications Act at section
301 authorized the Commission to issue licenses for radio communications. The information is also used to ensure
that applicants and licensees comply with the ownership and transfer restrictions imposed by section 310 of the Act.
The Commission's rules and regulations governing satellite communications are found at 47 CFR part 25. General requirements
under part 25 are contained in subpart A, subpart B contains applications and licenses requirements, subpart C contains
the technical standards, subpart D contains technical operations, subpart E contains the requirements for developmental
operations, and subpart H provides the requirements concerning the authorization of stock in Communications Satellite
Corporation. These rules establish the formal mechanisms for the filing and processing of earth and space station
applications. See Amendment of the Commission's Rules to Establish Rules and Policies Pertaining to a Non-voice,
Non-geostationary Mobile-Satellite Service, adopted 6/21/93; released 11/10/93.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Commission adopted a Second Order on Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266. The Second Order on Reconsideration describes revised regulations that
will govern cable service rate regulation by local and federal officials. These regulations will be used by cable
operators to assess whether rates for regulated basic cable services and rates for regulated cable programming services
are reasonable. Generally, the Commission refined and improved its statistical and economic analysis of the cable
industry, and adopted a new benchmark formula which will replace the old benchmark formula after May 15, 1994. The
benchmark formula is based on the competitive differential between rates charged by cable systems subject to effective
competition and those charged by systems not subject to effective competition, and establishes maximum permitted
levels for regulated cable service rates. The Commission has established a price cap mechanism to govern regulated
cable service rates on a going-forward basis. The revised regulations also include rules governing permitted rate
adjustments for changes in inflation, and permitted rate adjustments for changes in external costs, for instance,
programming costs associated with new and existing programming, retransmission consent fees, and taxes imposed
on the provision of cable service. The Fourth Report and Order describes revised regulations to govern permitted
rate adjustments when operators seek to add or delete channels on regulated service tiers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Commission also adopted a Third Order on Reconsideration in MM Docket Nos. 92&hyph;266 and 92&hyph;262 in which
it, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
refined the calculations necessary to determine permitted equipment and installation costs. The 1992 Cable Act
requires equipment and installation rates be based on actual cost. Pursuant to this Order, cable operators must generally
calculate and provide their equipment and installation charges on several occasions: (1) When establishing maximum
initial permitted rates for regulated cable services because Commission rules require operators to separate out
equipment and installation rates in the determination of initial regulated rates for basic cable service, and (2)
to update equipment and installation charges on an annual basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Finally, the Commission also adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in MM Docket No.
93&hyph;215 regarding cost-based cable regulation. In that document, the Commission adopted rules and procedures
for cost of service rate showings. Under these regulations, a cable operator may request relief from the required
reduction in rates by showing that its costs of service are unusually high. This approach balances the interests of
the cable operators and their customers, permitting operators to recover from customers only the reasonable costs
of providing regulated services, including operating expenses and a reasonable rate of return. The Commission provided
for reduced showings by small cable systems seeking to justify rates based on costs. Small systems can use a form that
calls for significantly less information in cost showings than other operators. This reduces the regulatory burden
on those businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. To implement the rules adopted in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, the Commission has developed the following forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. FCC Form 1200, Setting Maximum Initial Permitted Rates for Regulated Cable Services and Equipment Pursuant to
Rules Adopted February 22, 1994 (the ``First Time Filers Form''). This form is designed to collect information sufficient
to permit an operator regulated by a local franchise authority or the FCC to calculate figures relating to regulated
revenues per subscriber as of March 31, 1994, figures relating to the benchmark as of that date, and figures relating
to the Full Reduction Rate, which reflects application of the full 17 percent competitive differential. This form
then compares these sets of figures to derive the maximum permitted rates for regulated cable services as of May 15,
1994. The form will be filed with local franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response
to basic service rate regulation, and with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control
Number: 3060&hyph;0571, estimated annual burden: 11,200 responses; 20 hours per response; 224,000 hours total
annual burden.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. FCC Form 1201, Facsimile Request. This form permits cable operators to request assistance from the Commission
in completing FCC Form 1200. The operator may request assistance in determining the census income figure, the revised
benchmark calculation and the channel adjustments. OMB Control Number: 3060&hyph;0597, estimated annual burden:
14,000 responses; 1 hour per response; 14,000 hours total annual burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. FCC Form 1205, Determining Costs of Regulated Cable Equipment and Installation. This form collects information
sufficient to allow a cable operator to determine the costs associated with regulated equipment and installation
for the basic service tier and the maximum permitted charges for such equipment. This form will be filed in conjunction
with FCC Form 1200, to update equipment and installation charges on an annual basis. The form will be filed with local
franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation, and
with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060&hyph;0592, estimated
annual burden: 16,600 responses; 20 hours per response; 332,000 hours total annual burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. FCC Form 1210, Updating Maximum Permitted Rates for Regulated Services and Equipment. This form collects information
sufficient to allow the operator to calculate changes in external costs, addition and deletion of channels, and inflation
that have taken place since March 31, 1994. The form may be filed up to four times per year, once in each calendar year
quarter, by operators wishing to claim adjustments to maximum permitted rates to reflect increased costs. This form
must also be filed if there is a decrease in costs and to reflect channel deletions. The form will be filed with local
franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation, and
with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060&hyph;0595, estimated
annual burden: 33,600 responses; 10 hours per response; 336,000 hours total annual burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. FCC Form 1215, A La Carte Channel Offerings. This form is designed to collect and compare information about channels
offered on an individual (a la carte) basis and packages of these channels offered on April 1, 1993. This form must be
filed by the cable operator in conjunction with each FCC Form 1200 and FCC Form 1210. The form will be filed with local
franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in connection with basis service rate regulation,
and with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060&hyph;0593, estimated
annual burden: 44,800 responses; 1 hour per response; 44,800 hours total annual burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. To implement the rules adopted in the Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in MM Docket No.
93&hyph;215, the Commission has developed the following forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. FCC Form 1220, Cost of Service Schedule. This form is designed to be used by cable operators wishing to justify rates
above levels determined under the benchmark approach. The form will be filed with local franchising authorities
(or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation, and with the FCC in response to
cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060&hyph;0594, estimated annual burden: 2,100
responses; 80 hours per response; 168,000 hours total annual burden.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. FCC Form 1225, Cost of Service Schedule For Small Systems. This form can be used by independent small systems and
by small systems owned by a multiple system operator that services 250,000 subscribers or less, has no system with
more than 10,000 subscribers, and has an average system size of 1,000 subscribers or less. The form will be filed with
local franchising authorities (or the FCC in limited circumstances) in response to basic service rate regulation,
and with the FCC in response to cable programming service rate complaints. OMB Control Number: 3060&hyph;0596, estimated
annual burden: 700 responses; 60 hours per response; 42,000 hours total annual burden.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The GSA will serve as lead agency in the preparation of an EIS for the expansion of the U.S. plaza at the Rainbow Bridge
in Niagara Falls, New York. The project is sponsored by the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC), and includes the
demolition of existing plaza facilities and the construction of new, expanded facilities at the site. The GSA will
lease space at the newly expanded facility for use by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the
U.S. Customs Service. The international border functions of the INS and Customs are severely hindered at the Rainbow
Bridge due to increasing traffic volumes at the plaza and the limited size and functional obsolescence of the existing
facilities. Therefore, the proposed project is being undertaken to accommodate the existing and projected growth
in traffic and the resultant expansion requirements of INS and Customs. The proposed plaza facilities accommodate
existing and future demand by providing approximately 48,000 square feet (SF) of interior and exterior space which
will be leased to GSA for the essential functions of INS and Customs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS will evaluate U.S. Rainbow Bridge plaza alternatives, including the non-action alternative. It will also
evaluate impacts on the affected environment, including the following resource areas; subsurface and geological
conditions, including water quality; landforms; vegetation and wildfire; natural hazards; air quality; noise;
population and economic conditions; land use and zoning; archaeological, historic, architectural elements, and
visual impacts; utilities; traffic and transportation; and hazardous wastes. The Rainbow Bridge plaza is located
within the boundaries of the Niagara Reservation National Historic Landmark and issues related to Section 6(f) of
the U.S. Land and Water Conservation Fund Act and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act will be prominent
in the EIS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
cooperative agreements to: (1) Continue monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with the
leading causes of premature death through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS); and (2) Improve
the State capacity to analyze program data collected through the BRFSS and ensure the use of analyzed data in program
planning, monitoring, evaluation, determining program priorities, policy development, assessing trends, and
targeting relevant population groups. Survey data collection will continue to be encouraged and supported, but
the emphasis of this announcement is the analysis and routine use of collected data and information to actively direct
successful program development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This announcement addresses two distinct levels of support. The first is a Core Capacity Program, which consists
of using BRFSS data for planning, developing, integrating, coordinating and evaluating chronic disease(s) prevention
and control programs, and monitoring the prevalence of major behavioral risks associated with leading causes of
premature death. The second is an Enhanced Program, which is intended to increase State capacity to analyze BRFSS
data and institutionalize routine use of BRFSS data to develop meaningful interventions and direct program development.
Applicants may apply for a Core Capacity Program or for both a Core Capacity Program and an Enhanced Program. Enhanced
Program awards will only be considered for those applicants which successfully compete and are funded for Core Capacity
Program awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives
of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality
of life. This announcement is related to the priority area, Surveillance Data Systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(For ordering a copy of ``Healthy People 2000,'' see the section Where to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obtain Additional Information.)

Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is authorized under section 317(k)(3) (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(3)) of the Public Health Service Act, as amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Smoke-Free Workplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Public Health Service strongly encourages all cooperative agreement recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace
and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the
physical and mental health of the American people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assistance will be provided only to the official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities.
This includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the
Republic of Palau. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funding priority consideration for the Core Capacity Program will be given to States currently funded for BRFSS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eligible applicants have been restricted to official health departments of States or their bona fide agents or instrumentalities
because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The conduct of statewide health promotion, health education and risk reduction programs directed towards reducing
the prevalence of these behavioral risks in the population lie solely with State health departments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The methodology for the conduct of this program has been structured to support the national goals/objectives put
forth in ``Healthy People 2000.'' In many instances, State health departments have already embraced or established
their own goals/objectives which match or are synonymous with those outlined in ``Healthy People 2000.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information gathered under the BRFSS is expected to be of use to State health departments to support risk reduction
and disease prevention activities. Because comparable methods are used from State to State and from year to year,
States can compare risk factor prevalence with other States and monitor the effects of interventions over time. Also,
the use of consistent methods in a large group of States permits the assessment of geographic patterns of risk factor
prevalence. These telephone survey techniques can also be applied at the community level to guide local efforts in
reducing risk factor prevalence. Combined, the behavioral risk factor survey and surveillance data provide a new
resource to guide State and local disease prevention efforts.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proposed strategies to meet those objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An assessment of existing and needed resources to develop the comprehensive breast and cervical cancer control
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

of screening guidelines; (3) Use of screening reminder systems; (4) Laboratories used for reading Pap smears; and
(5) Sites of mammography referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the health care provider assessment has been conducted, States should collaborate with appropriate professional
groups and organizations to develop a provider education program. The development of a health provider education
program would transmit information on the efficacy and appropriate use of screening procedures and reminder systems
for providers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the components of a comprehensive quality assurance program based on guidelines developed by CDC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Mammography 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The achievement of mammography's full potential contribution to the process of early breast cancer detection requires
that quality assurance procedures be systematically applied in routine practice. Mammography quality assurance
encompasses the importance of the design, function, and operation of equipment, patient and provider communication,
image quality, interpretation of the mammogram, communication of the radiologist's interpretation, and record
keeping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Properly trained and experienced personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proper use of appropriate, well-maintained, dedicated equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Periodic performance evaluation tests of the imaging system following guidelines recommended by the American
College of Radiology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Cervical Cytology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

During the month of February 1994, the HHS Office of Inspector General imposed exclusions in the cases set forth below.
When an exclusion is imposed, no program payment is made to anyone for any items or services (other than an emergency
item or service not provided in a hospital emergency room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an excluded party under
the Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and Block Grants to States for Social Services
programs. In addition, no program payment is made to any business or facility, e.g., a hospital, that submits bills
for payment for items or services provided by an excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain free to decide for themselves
whether they will continue to use the services of an excluded party even though no program payments will be made for
items and services provided by that excluded party. The exclusions have national effect and also apply to all other
Federal non-procurement programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice provides notification to interested parties that the Office of Housing has amended HUD Notice H&hyph;93&hyph;71,
which provides procedures to HUD field offices of advertising for, receipt of, and processing requests for section
8 funds for service coordinators. Additional funds are available for service coordinators in Fiscal Year 1994 for
qualifying projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to HUD Notice H&hyph;93&hyph;71 (entitled ``Processing of Requests for section 8 Funds for Service
Coordinators in section 8, 202, 202/8, 221 and 236 Projects and Monitoring of Approved Requests_Fiscal Year (FY)
1994'') extends funding for service coordinators to section 8 projects (including FMHA section 515/8) with project-based
subsidy and section 221(d) BMIR and section 236 projects without project-based subsidy. Available funding is $22
million for section 202 and 202/8, $15 million for section 8, and $10 for section 221(d) BMIR and section 236 projects
without subsidy. All requests must be for projects which are housing for the elderly and disabled. Eligible projects
include any building within a mixed-use project that was designated for occupancy by elderly persons, or persons
with disabilities at its inception, or although not so designated, for which the eligible owner gives preferences
in tenant selection (with HUD approval) for all units in the eligible project to eligible elderly persons or persons
with disabilities. There are three new dollar allocation plans and a new request submission and review schedule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A service coordinator is a social service staff person hired by the project owner/management company. The coordinator
is responsible for assuring that the elderly, especially those who are frail, and disabled residents of the project
are linked to the supportive services they need to continue living independently in that project.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106 of the Reform Act amended section 7 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(q)(3))
to provide:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Any waiver of a regulation must be in writing and must specify the grounds for approving the waiver;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Authority to approve a waiver of a regulation may be delegated by the Secretary only to an individual of Assistant
Secretary rank or equivalent rank, and the person to whom authority to waive is delegated must also have authority
to issue the particular regulation to be waived;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Not less than quarterly, the Secretary must notify the public of all waivers of regulations that the Department
has approved, by publishing a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These Notices (each covering the period since the most recent previous notification) shall:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Identify the project, activity, or undertaking involved;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Describe the nature of the provision waived, and the designation of the provision;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Indicate the name and title of the person who granted the waiver request;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Describe briefly the grounds for approval of the request;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. State how additional information about a particular waiver grant action may be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's document notifies the public of HUD's waiver-grant activity from March 1 to September 30, 1993. The next Notice,
which will be published in the near future, will cover the period from October 1 through December 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ease of reference, waiver requests granted by departmental officials authorized to grant waivers are listed
in a sequence keyed to the section number of the HUD regulation involved in the waiver action. For example, a waiver-grant
action involving exercise of authority under 24 CFR 24.200 (involving the waiver of a provision in part 24) would come
early in the sequence, while waivers in the section 8 and section 202 programs (24 CFR chapter VIII) would be among the
last matters listed. Where more than one regulatory provision is involved in the grant of a particular waiver request,
the action is listed under the section number of the first regulatory requirement in title 24 that is being waived as
part of the waiver-grant action. (For example, a waiver of both &sect;811.105(b) and &sect;811.107(a) would appear
sequentially in the listing under &sect;811.105(b).) Waiver-grant actions involving the same initial regulatory
citation are in time sequence beginning with the earliest-dated waiver-grant action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the Department receive additional reports of waiver actions taken during the period covered by this report
before the next report is published, the next updated report will include these earlier actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, information about approved waiver requests pertaining to regulations of the Department is provided
in the Appendix to this Notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is in response to William Hernandez's memorandum, dated July 7, 1993, requesting a blanket waiver of the subject
regulation with respect to 26 Plans of Action for which Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. (CEI) or Joseph Carabetta is the
managing general partner. The request for the waiver is required because an audit report issued by the Regional Inspector
General for Audit on March 5, 1993, cited CEI for the improper diversion of funds from project accounts and/or the nonpayment
of section 236 Excess Income totalling approximately $7.5 million from 40 properties, including the 26 for which
the Plans of Action have been filed. The subject regulation prohibits approval of any Plan of Action so long as audit
findings are outstanding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reason Waived: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The mortgagors propose to resolve the audit findings by repaying the diverted funds out of equity proceeds distributed
as incentives pursuant to Plans of Action approved under the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987
(ELIHPA). Your office has also proposed a penalty in the amount of $3 million in lieu of pursuing civil money penalties
or affirmative litigation for double damages. Further, your office proposes to collect the full amount of the diverted
funds and the penalty from the proceeds of the approved Plans of Action 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in toto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
before the mortgagors may distribute any proceeds to the partnerships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This office approves the waiver request on the following conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Mortgagor Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All diversions and unpaid section 236 Excess Income, plus interest accruing at the Treasury Bill rate from the date
of the audit report, will be paid back to the project accounts or to the Department as appropriate from equity distributed
pursuant to approved Plans of Action. All diversions must be restored and all unpaid Excess income must be repaid prior
to the mortgagor retaining any of the equity for distribution to any of the partnerships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CEI will agree to pay $4,010,000, which represents $5,000 per audit violation for 802 violations. The full amount
of the payment must be remitted to the Department prior to the mortgagor retaining any equity distribution from approved
Plans of Action to any of the partnerships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All diversions repaid to the project account may be used to meet accounts payable to unaffiliated vendors. After all
such obligations have been discharged, the balance of the funds will be deposited into the Reserve for Replacement
escrow account with the mortgagee. The funds may not be used to pay obligations due affiliated or identity-of-interest
vendors, capital advances made by any partnership or partner, deposited into the Residual Receipts escrow account
or to pay accrued, unpaid distributions to any partnership.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortgagors will agree to apply for section 241(f) equity loans within five (5) working days of final approval of
ELIHPA Plans of Action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortgagors will agree to maintain the properties in good physical condition for the term of the use agreement executed
as a condition for receiving incentives pursuant to an approved ELIHPA Plan of Action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortgagors will agree to submit all required reports timely. Such reports will include monthly and quarterly
reports of project operations, accounts payable and accounts receivable as directed by your office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortgagors will agree that all books, records, files and related documents will be available for review, inspection
and audit by the Department or its designee for the term of the ELIHPA use agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortgagors will agree to offer a right of first refusal of sale on each property to the Department's designee upon
payment in full of the mortgage note at the expiration of the mortgage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mortgagors will agree to extend the affordability restrictions for a period of not less than 30 years beyond the
term of the original mortgage for each project for which an ELIHPA Plan of Action is approved.

Field Office Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Your office will prepare a schedule of payables due the projects and the Department, including all diversions, unpaid
section 236 excess income, accrued interest and civil money penalties. Upon approval of each ELIHPA Plan of Action,
the funding request to the Office of Preservation and Property Disposition will include an updated copy of this schedule
showing: interest accrued since the last funding request, proceeds of the equity loan and application of the proceeds
to project accounts, unpaid Excess Income and penalties as appropriate. This report will be required until the entire
amount of funds owed is repaid. Funds will be applied first to diversions and interest, second to delinquent excess
income and interest, and third to penalties, until all are paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon approval of an ELIHPA Plan of Action, your office will report a waiver of 24 CFR 248.233(f) for the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first 80% of the penalty is to be remitted to be deposited in the Special Risk Insurance Fund. The balance (20%) of
the penalty should have separate checks issued, on a unit proportionate basis, to tenant associations or their legal
representatives, of each of the 40 projects for use as those associations see fit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If you have any questions about the terms and conditions of this waiver, please call Kevin East at (202) 708&hyph;2300.

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on September 2, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.10%. The tax-exempt
refunding bond issue of $2,775,000 at current low-interest rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains
long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt bonds at an 11.75% interest rate at
the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.10%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage
interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.75% to 7.0%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The
refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax
revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide
housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

The Part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms

been priced to an average yield of 6.0%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $1,565,000 at current low-interest
rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of

will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rates at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.5% to approximately

tax-exempt coupons of 13% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 7.28%. The refunding will also substantially
reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk.
The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury
tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to
provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on April 23, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.22%. The tax-exempt
refunding bond issue of $1,015,000 at current low-interest rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains
long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10%&hyph;10.75% at the

The Part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on April 6, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 6.04%. The tax-exempt refunding
bond issue of $2,205,000 at current low-interest rates will save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term
tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 10.25% at the call date in 1993 with
tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.04%. The refunding will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at
expiration of the HAP contract, from 10.73% to 7.25%, thus reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves
the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section 8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping
reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income
families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refunding bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on June 1, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.95%. The tax-exempt refunding
bond issue of $1,400,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term
tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.95%. The refunding will also
substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rates at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.5% to 6.15%, thus
reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's Section
8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood
that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD
objective.

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on May 7, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced
to an average yield of 6.03%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $7,575,000 at current low-interest rates will
save Section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding
tax-exempt coupons of 11.5% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 6.03%. The refunding will also
substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 11.5% to 5.25%, thus reducing
FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section 8 program
costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood that
projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD objective.

that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD
objective.

 The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. This refunding proposal was approved by HUD on August 3, 1993. Refunding bonds have been
priced to an average yield of 5.89%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $2,160,000 at current low-interest rates
will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding
tax-exempt coupons of 9.88% at the call date in 1993 with tax-exempt bonds yielding 5.89%. The refunding will also
substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, from 10.125% to 6.095%, thus
reducing FHA mortgage insurance risk. The refunding serves the important public purposes of reducing HUD's section
8 program costs, improving Treasury tax revenues, (helping reduce the budget deficit), and increasing the likelihood
that projects will continue to provide housing for lower-income families after subsidies expire, a priority HUD
objective.

 The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms

at an average yield of 6.50%. The tax-exempt refunding bond issue of $1,955,000 at current low-interest rates will
save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding

The part 811 regulations cited above were intended for original bond financing transactions and do not fit the terms
of refunding transactions. To credit enhance refundings bonds not fully secured by the FHA mortgage amount, HUD also
agrees not to exercise its option under 24 CFR 207.259(e) to call debentures prior to maturity. This refunding proposal
was approved by HUD on September 8, 1993. Refunding bonds have been priced to an average yield of 5.55%. The tax-exempt
refunding bond issue of $10,675,000 at current low-interest rates will save section 8 subsidy. The Treasury also
gains long-term tax revenue benefits through replacement of outstanding tax-exempt coupons of 9.25%&hyph;10.125%

will also substantially reduce the FHA mortgage interest rate at expiration of the HAP contract, thus reducing FHA

Reason Waived: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is aware of an HA's need to weigh the unsuitability of certain landlords against the family's ability
to take advantage of a wide range of housing choices. The supporting documentation submitted by DHD reported that
from October 1990 through May 1992, there were only two cases where units selected by families had owners with unpaid
property taxes, and that in both cases the owners agreed to make payment arrangements and the units were processed
for the program. The waiver was determined to be in the public interest of the city of Detroit, and does not appear to
result in any significant reduction to the housing choices available to families.

to extend the October 30, 1992, deadline for installing smoke detectors on each level of every unit to October 31, 1993,
to allow additional time for the AHA to install hard-wired smoke detectors required by local law.

Housing and Urban Development (HUD), LBP Guidelines recommend use of competitive proposals. However, HUD CIAP Regulations
only permit sealed bid methods. New York City Housing Authority prepared solicitations based on competitive proposals
and the HUD office inadvertently approved. New York City's request for waiver was granted because of HUD's error and
administrative inconvenience of revising solicitation documents within required time frames.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HA is a small agency with 49 units of elderly housing. It has been hampered in its efforts to reduce vacancies by local
economic dislocations and loss of population. HA was allowed to use a goal of 82% for its fiscal year ending in 1992.
Since the time of the last waiver, the HA has made progress in reducing its vacancies from nine to six units. Further
reductions may be expected if the HA's application for CIAP funds are approved and some of the vacant units are reconfigured
into larger units and/or converted into nondwelling use. Because of the progress made, the HA was permitted to use
88% as its projected occupancy percentage for its fiscal year ending 6/30/93.

The goal of the COP was to achieve a vacancy level of five or fewer vacant units, which for this 80 unit HA corresponded
to a 94% level. The HA and Ft. Worth Office did not realize until recently that the Department had recognized that the
use of 97% in this type of situation created an inequity. Failure to achieve an acceptable goal of 94% should not result
in the imposition of an even higher occupancy level of 97% on the HA. A waiver was granted to allow the use of 94% as the
projected occupancy percentage in order to correct this inequitable situation.

The Newark Housing Authority (NHA) did not submit an approvable COP when it was first eligible to do so for its fiscal
year beginning 4/1/87. Instead, with the Department's approval, NHA has used a series of Memorandums of Agreement
(MOAs) that included an occupancy goal to be used in determining its operating subsidy eligibility. In March 1993,
the NHA requested approval of a 12-year COP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on experience gained from Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) implementing the vacancy rule, the Department found
that large PHAs designated as ``troubled authorities'', such as NHA, had vacancy problems of such a magnitude and
complexity that long-term planning was very difficult. Plans that were approved for such PHAs quickly became obsolete
and much time and effort were spent justifying changes to occupancy goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Department continues to believe that it is very difficult for large troubled PHAs to adhere to a long term
plan with fixed occupancy goals, the request for a waiver that would result in the approval of a 12-year COP was not approved.
Instead, good cause was found to waive the subject regulation and allow the NHA to use an occupancy goal of 72% for its
1993 fiscal year and 78% for its 1994 fiscal year. Conditions were also placed on how the additional operating subsidy
generated as a result of the waiver could be used.

The Chicago Housing Authority argued that the magnitude of its safety and security needs is so great, it requires the
Authority to redirect resources from other priority initiatives such as vacancy reduction to fund safety and security
measures. This redirection of resources was expected to continue for at least the two year period of the waiver request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A five-year Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been executed earlier between the Regional Office and the Authority
which contained performance targets in the area of vacancy reduction. In order not to jeopardize the agreements that
had been reached, a waiver was granted for the Authority's 1993 fiscal year (FY). Conditions were also placed on how
the additional operating subsidy generated as a result of the waiver could be used. These included having at least
60% of the additional funds be used specific, identifiable actions to increase occupancy which would leave 40% of
the additional funds available for security measures. A waiver for the Authority's FY 1994 will not be considered
until a review of actual accomplishments in FY 1993 can be made and compared with the actual goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A NOFA was not used to announce the availability of funds under FHAP. A waiver was needed on this case because FHAP is
incorrectly listed in section 12.10 as a competitive program, and thus subject to the requirement that a notice of
funding availability must be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 when funds are available under the program. The Secretary also waived 24 CFR part 111 which requires a NOFA to be published.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waivers were granted for good cause. Each city requested an extension to the date of submission for their CHAS Annual
Plan and/or Performance Report. Otherwise, they would lose FY 1993 funding for all programs that require an approved
housing strategy as a condition for funding. Undue hardship would result if HUD applied authorized sanctions and
suspended funding of existing programs in these communities. Such action would deprive low and moderate income persons
of the benefits of HUD-funded programs. Woonsocket was granted an 8 day extention for the CHAS and the Performance
Report since the Mayor was unavailable to sign the documents by the deadline. New Bedford was granted an 8 day extension
for the CHAS and a 67 day extension for the Performance Report. East Providence was granted a 64 day extension for the
Performance Report submission. Both cities report the need for the waivers was due to their oversights or incomplete
understanding of the HUD requirements.

Department recognizes that in some high-cost areas, there may be few properties whose purchase price and/or after
rehabilitation value are below the section 203(b) caps. The local jurisdictions indicated that to have a viable homeownership
program, they need to have the limit increased. A HUD review confirmed the validity of the requests, analyzed the data
and, therefore, for good cause, granted waivers establishing the recommended limits as follows: Alhambra, CA.,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The waivers were issued for good cause. The waiver approval to Franklin County noted that in response to many public
comments, the Department would issue an interim rule to modify the definition of SRO found at 24 CFR 92.2 to require
sanitary or food preparation facilities only if the project consists of new construction, conversion of non-residential
space, or reconstruction. For acquisition or rehabilitation of an existing residential structure, neither type
of amenity is required in the unit. However, the Department strongly encourages participating jurisdictions to
provide a higher level of amenities whenever possible, to contribute to the continued marketability of the standard
housing stock in the future. This change is made in response to public comment that installing plumbing when rehabilitating
an existing residential structure may be financially prohibitive. Nonetheless, the Department believes that for
new construction, reconstruction and conversion, a higher level of amenities is appropriate and desirable. The
new SRO definition was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons Waived: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under many State laws, State housing finance agencies (HFAs), are not part of the State government. Under the HOME
statute, if a HFA is not a State agency it cannot be designated as the participating jurisdiction. In such cases where
the State wants the HFA to administer the HOME Program, an agency of the State must be the participating jurisdiction
and the HFA must be designated as a subrecipient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the written agreement between a State and an instrumentality of the State that is a subrecipient
need not contain the same detailed information as is required of other entities receiving HOME funds. Further, the
Department amended &sect;92.504(b) by the publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on June 23, 1993, of an interim rule which established much simpler requirements for State subrecipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore there was good cause to grant the requested waiver of 24 CFR 92.504(b) and to allow the Alaska Housing Finance
Corporation to enter into a written agreement with the State of Alaska using the much simpler requirements for State
subrecipients.

A previous waiver of pre-agreement costs, which was approved June 26, 1992, permitted the City to proceed with the
construction of a senior center and reimburse the costs of constructing the facility with CDBG funds from 1992&hyph;1998.
Although the site preparation and foundation work had begun, unforeseen soil conditions had necessitated change
orders that would have resulted in an increase in the cost. The City needed to request an amendment to the period covered
by the waiver. Failure to approve this request may impose a greater hardship on the City since it has already incurred
contractual obligations for construction of the project and would cause undue hardship and adversely affect the
purposes of the Act. For good cause the limitations on pre-agreement costs at 24 CFR 570.200(a)(5) and 570.200(h)
were waived to permit the reimbursement of the costs of constructing this facility with CDBG funds from 1992 through
the year 2000.

them with transitional housing. Use of HUD-acquired properties by lessees must be with the understanding that the
housing provided under this program is transitional and the occupants are expected to seek and obtain permanent housing
resources within two years.

prepared and made available a Supplemental Environmental Assessment (Supplemental EA) for the proceedings referenced
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Gateway Western Railway Company (GWWR) and its subsidiary Gateway Eastern Railway Company (GWER) have petitioned
the Interstate Commerce Commission in separate pleadings for authority to construct and operate connecting tracks,
among other related actions, in East St. Louis, St. Clair County, Illinois. If the proposed segments are constructed,
(1) GWWR would have a direct and efficient route to the CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT) interchange at Cone Yard in
East St. Louis and (2) GWWR, in conjunction with GWER trackage rights, would have direct and efficient access to Consolidated
Rail Corporation's (Conrail) Rose Lake Yard in East St. Louis. The construction and operation of these two new connections
would eliminate GWWR's current circuitous routings to its CSXT and Conrail interchanges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Supplemental EA will be available on April 5, 1994. There will be a 30-day comment period. Comments on the Supplemental
EA are due May 5, 1994. To obtain copies of the Supplemental EA contact Ms. Judith Groves or Ms. Phillis Johnson-Ball,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63186&hyph;63187), the Department of Labor published the criteria and application process
for the National Award for Diversity and Excellence in American Management which was established pursuant to Public
Law 102&hyph;166, The Glass Ceiling Act of 1991. The glass ceiling is defined as those artificial barriers based on
attitudinal or organizational bias that prevent qualified minorities and women from advancing in their organizations
into management and decisionmaking positions. The award is a Presidential award to recognize a United States business
for excellence in promoting a more diverse skilled work force at the management and decisionmaking levels in business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of continuing interest in this award, the Commission believes that it is desirable to reopen and extend the
application period for all interested parties. Therefore, the application period for the applications is reopened
and extended through April 30, 1994.

Petitions have been filed with the Secretary of Labor under section 221(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Act'') and
are identified in the Appendix to this notice. Upon receipt of these petitions, the Director of the Office of Trade

221(a) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of each of the investigations is to determine whether the workers are eligible to apply for adjustment
assistance under Title II, Chapter 2, of the Act. The investigations will further relate, as appropriate, to the determination
of the date on which total or partial separations began or threatened to begin and the subdivision of the firm involved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners or any other persons showing a substantial interest in the subject matter of the investigations may
request a public hearing, provided such request is filed in writing with the Director, Office of Trade Adjustment
Assistance, at the address shown below, not later than April 15, 1994.

212 of the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics and Allied Workers International Union (GMP) requested administrative

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 on March 4, 1994 (59 FR 10429).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) if it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) if in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation files show that the workers produced commercial glass containers for drug, chemical, liquor,
beer and wine producers. The plant closed on December 31, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The union stated that the machinery for producing glass containers is being shipped overseas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial is based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements
of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the workers' firm's customers.
The Department's survey of the firm's major declining customers showed that none of the respondents increased their
imports while decreasing their purchases from Owens-Illinois. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings show that most of the production was shipped to other domestic corporate plants. A domestic shift of
production would not form a basis for a worker group certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, machinery used in the production of glass containers is not like or directly competitive with glass containers.
In order for a worker group to become certified it must meet all three of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade
Act_(1) a significant decrease in employment (2) an absolute decrease in sales or production and (3) increased imports
of articles which are like or directly competitive with those produced at the petitioning workers' firm and which
``contributed importantly'' to declines in sales or production and employment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The union states that the workers should be certified since Olympic had reduced business from kitchen appliance manufacturing
customers who took their production overseas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that Olympic Plating is an independent contractor which performs plating services
on components (stove tops, etc.) for kitchen appliance manufacturing customers. The findings show that Olympic
Plating did not own the components to be plated but only performed plating services on them. Olympic Plating was independent
of its customers and there was no corporate relationship between Olympic Plating and its customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the workers do not produce an article within the meaning of the Trade
Act, as amended. The Department has consistently determined that the performance of services does not constitute
the production of an article and this determination has been upheld in the U.S. Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the
plating services performed by Olympic Plating cannot be considered the production of an article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The worker adjustment assistance program was not intended to provide TAA to workers who are in some way related to import
competition but only for those workers who produce an article and are adversely affected by increased imports of like
or directly competitive articles which contributed importantly to sales or production and employment declines
at the workers' firm.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

I
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Henry Ford Hospital (Licensee) is the holder of NRC License No. 21&hyph;04109&hyph;08 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR part 35. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess and use cobalt-60
for medical use as described in 10 CFR 35.600 in an AECL Theratron 780 teletherapy unit, and for irradiation of animals.
The license was issued on August 2, 1957, was most recently amended in its entirety on February 14, 1994, and is due to
expire on November 30, 1988.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of a teletherapy misadministration which occurred in early 1984, the NRC issued a Confirmatory Order dated
July 17, 1984, which ordered the Licensee to implement a Teletherapy Treatment Quality Assurance Program as described
in Section II of the Order (EA 84&hyph;067). In accordance with 10 CFR 35.32(f)(2) the Licensee submitted a written
quality management program to the NRC on January 23, 1992. In a letter dated April 8, 1993, the Licensee requested the
NRC to rescind the 1984 Order for the following reasons: (1) All subsequent NRC inspections have found the Licensee
to be in compliance with the 1984 Order; (2) No therapeutic misadministrations have occurred at Henry Ford Hospital
since the 1984 Order was issued; and (3) Regulatory changes in 10 CFR part 35 pertaining to the Quality Management Program
encompass all aspects of the 1984 Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1993 the NRC's Division of Industrial and Medical Nuclear Safety completed a review of the licensee's
1992 Quality Management Program submittal. Subsequently, in a letter dated March 1, 1994, the NRC notified the Licensee
that its Quality Management Program, as set forth in its letter dated January 23, 1992, appears to meet the requirements
of 10 CFR 35.32. In addition, the NRC staff agrees with the Licensee that the actions required by the 1984 Order are superseded
by current regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I find that the Licensee's Quality Management Program encompasses the requirements of the Teletherapy Treatment
Quality Assurance Program required by the 1984 Order. Therefore, the 1984 Order should be rescinded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, pursuant to sections 81, 161b, 161i, 161o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and
the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR part 35, it is hereby ordered that the confirmatory order issued
to the licensee on July 17, 1984 (EA 84&hyph;067) is rescinded.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of an October 15, 1993 enforcement order issued to the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation (SFC) and General Atomics
(GA) concerning the decontamination and decommissioning funding for the Sequoyah Fuels facility at Gore, Oklahoma.
58 FR 55087.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the order, SFC and GA both requested a hearing. On November 22, 1993, an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
was established to preside over the proceeding. 58 FR 63406. The Licensing Board is comprised of Administrative Judges
James P. Gleason, who is the Board Chairman, Dr. Jerry R. Kline and G. Paul Bollwerk, III. On January 13, 1994, the Licensing
Board was reconstituted by adding Administrative Judge Thomas D. Murphy as an Alternate Member. 59 FR 3382.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 18, 1993, Native Americans for a Clean Environment (NACE) filed a motion for leave to intervene in this
proceeding. After conducting a January 19, 1994 prehearing conference in Bethesda, Maryland, on January 25, 1994,
the Licensing Board issued an unpublished memorandum and order granting the NACE request to intervene and directing
NACE to file a supplemental petition listing contentions it seeks to have litigated. (The Board subsequently issued
a published memorandum and order detailing the reasons for its determination. LBP&hyph;94&hyph;5, 39 NRC

Intermarket Trading System; Order Approving Eleventh Amendment to the ITS Relating To Use of a Back-Up System

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 21, 1993, the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission'') an amendment to the restated ITS Plan pursuant to Section 11A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78k&hyph;1, and Rule 11a3a&hyph;2 thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The ITS participants filed the proposal to make several technical amendments to the ITS Plan including amendments
relating to the use of a back-up system. Notice of the proposal appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 1, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission received no comments on the proposal. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving
the proposal.

The ITS is a National Market System (``NMS'') plan approved by the Commission pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and
Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2. The ITS was designed to facilitate intermarket trading in exchange-listed equity securities
based on current quotation information emanating from the linked markets. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19456
(January 27, 1983), 48 FR 4938. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants to the ITS Plan include the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.
(``BSE''), the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE''), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), the
New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'').

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal makes several technical amendments to the ITS Plan to: (1) Provide for use of a back-up system in the event
ITS becomes inoperable; (2) recognize the use of the Regional Computer Interface (``RCI'') by the Amex; (3) eliminate
references to line costs and line sharing; (4) require a biennial rather than an annual audit by an independent public
accountant; (5) change all references to the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE'') to CHX; and (6) correct the addresses
of the CHX, CSE, and PSE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal adds Section 15 to the ITS Plan to provide for the use of a back-up system. In the event the ITS system becomes
inoperable, ITS would utilize a designated NYSE operating system (``NYSE System'') on a preemptive and priority
basis. The NYSE System is comprised of computers and peripheral equipment sufficient to operate ITS at a minimum 50%
of the ITS's rated 17 messages per second capacity and 75% of the ITS's disk capacity. The NYSE System would assume the
functions of the ITS within two hours in the event of a limited disaster and on the next day in the event of a full site disaster.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal amends the ITS Plan to provide for the use of the RCI by the Amex through the Amex Display Book Manager (``DBM'').
The Amex DBM is a computerized system that when fully implemented will, to some extent, replace the original ITS stations
on the Amex trading floor. The proposal will permit communications, through the Amex DBM, between the ITS and the Amex
floor.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal eliminates references in the ITS Plan to line costs and line sharing. Because of technological advances,
references to line costs and line sharing are no longer applicable. The ITS Plan will continue to delineate development
and production costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal amends the ITS Plan's audit provision to require a biennial rather than an annual audit of expenses, allocations,
and computations, by an independent public accountant. The proposal requires an internal audit to review all expenses,
allocations, and computations by ITS for those years when an independent audit is not conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provides other technical amendments to the ITS Plan. The proposal changes all references to the MSE to
CHX; and would correct the addresses of the CHX, CSE, and PSE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that approval of the amendment is consistent with the Act, in particular, with sections 11A(a)(1)
(C)(ii) and (D) which provide for fair competition among the ITS participants and their members, and the linking of
all markets for qualified securities through communications and data processing facilities which foster efficiency,
enhance competition, increase the information available to brokers, dealers, and investors, facilitate the offsetting
of investors' orders, and contribute to the best execution of such orders. The Commission also finds the amendment
consistent with Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2(c)(2) which requires the Commission to determine that the amendment is necessary
and appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets,
to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanisms of, a national market system or otherwise in furtherance of the
purpose of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal provides for the use of a back-up facility in the event the ITS system becomes inoperable, and enhances
order routing and execution of communications between the Amex and the other ITS participants. This will improve
the efficiency and reliability of ITS, especially during periods of high trading volume.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal provides additional, technical amendments to the ITS Plan consistent with ITS's purpose: To facilitate
intermarket trading in exchange-listed equity securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will amend Section 1001 (Exercise Procedures) of DGOC's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to change the time by which a participant must tender to DGOC's clearing bank an option exercise notice. The cutoff
time will be changed from 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. or such earlier time as may be announced by the Public Securities Association
as the recommended closing time for trading in the government securities markets on the business day the participant
wishes to exercise an option contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also will amend DGOC's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1002 (Assignment of Exercise Notices) which describes the manner in which exercise notices are assigned
to participants. Currently when less than all exercisable options in a class of options (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, all puts and calls covering the same issue of Treasury Securities) are exercised, exercise notices are assigned
randomly to participants that maintain short positions in that class of options. Under the proposal, exercise notices
will be assigned to each participant maintaining a short position in the same class of options on a pro rata basis. The
pro rata allocation will be determined by a formula whereby the total number of exercise notices received for a class
of options will be multiplied by the ratio of the number of exercisable options in that class subject to exercise that
a participant maintains to all exercisable options in the class.

Finally, the proposal will change the time by which exercise notices will be assigned under DGOC's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1002. Currently, exercise notices are assigned at or before 8 a.m. on the business day following acceptance
of an exercise notice by DGOC's clearing bank. Under the proposal, assignments will take place at or before 5 p.m on
the same business day that the clearing bank accepts an exercise notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal will permit participants with short positions to receive more timely notice of their assignments of
exercises and will allow them to manage more precisely their financial exposure following assignments by permitting
them to engage in other trading on that business day. The proposal also will provide a method whereby DGOC will allocate
exercise notices in a fairer manner. The new cutoff time for submission of exercise notices, the pro rata assignment
of exercise notices, and the earlier notice of assignments are consistent with the policies and practices of the over-the-counter
market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DGOC states in its filing that upon publication of this notice DGOC will inquire of all its participants that maintain
long positions with DGOC whether they perceive any special burden associated with the one hour reduction in the time
available for exercise. DGOC states that if any participant should wish to maintain the 5 p.m. exercise notice tendering
time on any outstanding option, DGOC will defer implementation of the proposed rule change until one day following
the expiration of all such outstanding options subject to the 5 p.m. time. DGOC further states in the filing that once
the formal inquiry of participants has been completed, participants should expect to receive notice from DGOC that
all options issued by DGOC and expiring after a certain date will be subject to the changes made in this proposal. From
its informal polling of participants, DGOC estimates that implementation of the 4 p.m. cutoff time shall occur during
the first quarter of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DGOC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and particularly with section 17A of the Act
in that it will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

holding foreign customer accounts. It is intended that this interpretation will be published as an Interpretation
Memorandum for inclusion in the Exchange Interpretation Handbook.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exchange Rule 409 addresses the requirement of member organizations to send statements of accounts and confirmations
to customers. One of the purposes of Rule 409 is to ensure that member organization's communications to customers
are sent to appropriate and/or authorized persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 409(b)(2) provides that customer mail (i.e. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
statements, confirmations and other communications) may not be addressed to any member, member organization or
in care of an employee of any member organization. This, in effect, prohibits the receipt and retention by a member,
member organization, registered representative or other associated person, of customer mail. The rule, however,
does permit the Exchange to waive the rule's requirements, upon written request. The Exchange has received requests
from member organizations to permit them to hold mail for certain foreign customers who have represented in writing
that they do not wish to receive such correspondence. Reasons for such requests have included inefficient local mail
services (resulting in misrouted mail or opened mail) or unstable political climates. In order to review and approve
such requests, the Exchange has established guidelines. The Exchange is proposing this written interpretation
to codify the procedures and standards for reviewing requests from member organizations to hold foreign customer
mail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed interpretation provides that the Exchange will consider written requests from members and member organizations
for the implementation of procedures for temporarily holding foreign customer mail. Such requests will be required
to provide certain details and representations concerning supervisory procedures that the member or member organization
will have in place with respect to holding mail. Specifically, members and member organizations will be required
to obtain, at least on an annual basis, a written request from the customer to have mail temporarily held at the premises
of the firm and providing appropriate reasons for such request. Additionally, the organization's written procedures
must address, at a minimum that: such accounts will receive frequent supervisory review with special attention given
to discretionary accounts; the communications will be reviewed annually by the compliance/internal audit department
or by person(s) delegated such responsibility pursuant to Exchange Rule 342 (independent of the branch), and such
review will include a test that the communications are held pursuant to written customer instructions; a log of the
communications will be maintained which shows the date of transmittal of the communications to the customer; and
that endeavors will be made to orally communicate the substance of the communications directly to the customer and
that a written record is kept of all meetings and conversations with the customer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that this proposed interpretation will give members and member organizations the flexibility
to hold mail upon customer request, while providing appropriate safeguards through enhanced supervisory procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires that the
rules of the Exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest, in that it establishes standards
that enable members and member organizations to meet customer requests yet provide customer protection through
appropriate monitoring and supervision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Canada Life Account was established by Canada Life as a separate account under the laws of Michigan on July 22,
1988, pursuant to a resolution of Canada Life's board of directors. The Canada Life Account is currently registered
as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811&hyph;5817).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Canada Life Account will invest in shares of the investment portfolios of the Canada Life of America Series Fund,
Inc., as well as portfolios of other specified registered open-end management investment companies (collectively,
the ``Funds''). The Funds are diversified, open-end management investment companies with a number of series, or
portfolios. The assets of each portfolio are separate from the other portfolios, and each portfolio has separate
investment objectives and policies. As a result, each portfolio operates as a separate investment fund, and the investment
performance of one portfolio has no effect on the investment performance of any other portfolio. The Canada Life Account
has a number of subaccounts, each of which invests solely in a specific corresponding portfolio of one of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Canada Life of New York, a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on June
7, 1971, is principally engaged in the sale of annuity contracts and life insurance policies in the State of New York.
Canada Life of New York is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Canada Life Assurance Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Canada Life of New York Account was established by Canada Life of New York as a separate account under the laws
of the State of New York on September 13, 1989, pursuant to a resolution of Canada Life of New York's board of directors.
The Canada Life of New York Account currently is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act (File No. 811&hyph;5961).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Canada Life of New York Account will invest in shares of one or more of the investment portfolios of the Funds.
The Canada Life of New York Account has a number of subaccounts, each of which invests solely in a specific corresponding
portfolio of the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. CLAFS is a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Life, and acts as the distributor and principal underwriter of the Contracts.
CLAFS is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Contracts are individual flexible premium variable deferred annuity contracts. The Contracts may be purchased
on a non-tax-qualified basis, or they may be purchased and used in connection with retirement plans or individual
retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment. Generally, the Contracts may be purchased
with an initial purchase payment of at least $5,000. However, the initial purchase payment may be reduced to: $100
if the Contract owner has executed a preauthorized check agreement for additional purchase payments to be automatically
withdrawn monthly from the Contract owner's bank account (a ``PAC agreement''); or $2,000 if the Contract is to fund
an Individual Retirement Annuity (``IRA''). (The Companies reserve the right to lower or raise the minimum premium
for IRAs.) Generally, subsequent purchase payments must be at least $1,000. However, such purchase payments may
be reduced to: $100 or more if the purchase payment is made by preauthorized check pursuant to a PAC agreement; or $50
or more per month if an IRA Rider is in effect, and provided that no purchase payment, together with the total of other
purchase payments, would exceed $1,000,000 unless the applicable Company consents to a larger amount.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A Contract owner may allocate net purchase payments to one or more subaccounts of the applicable Account, each of
which will invest in a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. (Net purchase payments equal purchase payments less
any premium taxes deducted.) Purchase payments will be credited with the investment experience of the selected subaccount(s).
A Contract owner also may allocate net purchase payments to the applicable Company's general account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Prior to the annuity date, a Contract owner may transfer Contract value among subaccounts of the applicable Account,
or surrender a Contract or withdraw a portion of the cash surrender value. The amount payable upon surrender, the cash
surrender value, is the Contract value less any applicable contingent deferred sales charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Contracts provide for a series of annuity payments beginning on the annuity date. A Contract owner may select
from several annuity payment options, all of which are fixed options that provide for payments out of the applicable
Company's general account.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. If the annuitant dies prior to the annuity date, a death benefit is payable upon receipt of due proof of death as well
as proof that the annuitant died prior to the annuity date. Up to the fifth anniversary of the Contract, the death benefit
will be equal to the greater of: (1) Purchase payments paid, reduced by any partial surrenders (including applicable
surrender charges and any incurred taxes); or (2) the Contract value on the date the applicable Company receives due
proof of death. If a Company receives due proof of death after the fifth anniversary of the Contract, the death benefit
is the greatest of: (1) Purchase payments paid, reduced by any partial surrenders (including applicable surrender
charges and any incurred taxes); (2) the Contract value on the date the applicable Company receives due proof of death;
or (3) the Contract value at the end of the fifth Contract year preceding the date the applicable Company receives due
proof of death, plus purchase payments, less partial surrenders (including applicable surrender charges), and
less any incurred taxes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Companies deduct an administration charge of $30 per Contract year ($45 if a PAC agreement was in force at any
time during the Contract year) to compensate the applicable Company for the administrative services provided to
Contract owners. This charge will be deducted from the Contract value at the end of each Contract year prior to the annuity
date, and upon a full surrender on any date other than a Contract anniversary. Applicants represent that the administration
charge will be deducted in reliance on Rule 26a&hyph;1 and Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act, and represents reimbursement
only for the administration costs expected to be incurred over the life of the Contract. This charge is guaranteed
not to increase for the duration of the Contract, and the Companies neither expect nor intend to make a profit from this
charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The Companies will assess a daily administrative charge under the Contracts to compensate them for the administrative
expenses they will bear in connection with the Contracts and the Accounts. For incurring these administrative expenses
in connection with the Contracts and the Accounts, the Companies will deduct from their respective Contracts a daily
administrative charge at an annual rate of 0.15% of the value of net assets in each subaccount. This rate will be guaranteed
not to increase for the duration of the Contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. A contingent deferred sales charge of 6% of the amount withdrawn is imposed on certain full surrenders or partial
surrenders of Contract Value to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Contracts, including commissions to registered
representatives and other promotional expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Purchase payments paid at least five or more Contract years prior to the date of surrender or partial surrender
are not subject to the contingent deferred sales charge. The Companies will also waive the contingent deferred sales
charge for the first partial surrender in any Contract year if equal to or less than 10% of current premiums (premiums
paid within the previous four Contract years, less any prior partial surrenders or systematic withdrawals from current
premiums), and if the Contract owner has not elected the systematic withdrawal privilege for that Contract year.
The Companies will not deduct the contingent deferred sales charge from investment earnings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The Companies will assess a daily charge to compensate them for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in
connection with the Contracts. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
in the applicable Account. Of that amount, approximately 0.55% is attributable to mortality risks, and approximately
0.70% is attributable to expense risks. The Companies guarantee that this charge will never increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. The mortality risk borne by the Companies arises from: (1) Their contractual obligations to make annuity payments
(determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions contained in the Contracts) regardless of
how long all annuitants or any individual annuitant may live; and (2) their possible obligation to pay a claim for a
death benefit in excess of a Contract owner's Contract value. The Companies also will assume an expense risk through
their guarantees not to increase the charges for issuing the Contracts and administering the Contracts and the Accounts,
regardless of their actual expenses, including maintaining policy records, communicating with Contract owners,
and processing transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. If the mortality and expense risk charges under a Contract are insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks,
the loss will fall on the applicable Company. Conversely, if the charges are more than sufficient to cover costs, any
excess will be profit to the Company. The Companies currently do not anticipate a profit from these charges.

20. The Companies may deduct any applicable premium tax from gross purchase payments. The Companies reserve the right,
however, to deduct any applicable aggregate premium taxes paid on behalf of a particular Contract from the Contract
value upon full or partial surrender or on the Annuity Date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The Companies assess no charge for the first twelve transfers in each Contract Year, and will assess a $25 charge
for each subsequent transfer request made by the Contract owner during a single Contract Year. The Companies do not
count transfers made in connection with dollar cost averaging in determining whether to impose the $25 transfer charge.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemption from Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent necessary
to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment
trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless
the proceeds of all payments (other than sales loads) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and
held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants submit that the Companies are entitled to reasonable compensation for their assumption of mortality
and expense risks. Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge of 1.25% assessed under the Contracts
is consistent with the protection of investors because they are reasonable and proper insurance charges. In this
regard, Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable to compensate the Companies
for the risks that: (i) annuitants under the Contracts will live longer as a group than has been anticipated in setting
the annuity rates guaranteed in the Contracts; (ii) the Contract value will be less than the death benefit; and (iii)
administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Companies represent that the charges for mortality and expense risks assumed by them are within the range of
industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon the Companies'
analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors
as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. The Companies
will maintain at their respective administrative offices, available to the Commission, memoranda setting forth
in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, their comparative surveys.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charges may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution
of the Contracts. Applicants also acknowledge that if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charges,
all or a portion of such profit may be viewed by the Commission as being offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed
by the sales charge. The Companies have concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution
financing arrangements will benefit the Accounts and the Contract owners. The basis for such conclusions are set
forth in memoranda which will be maintained by the Companies at their respective administrative offices and will
be available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Companies also represent that the Accounts will only invest in management investment companies which undertake,
in the event such an investment company adopts a plan under Rule 12b-1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board
of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any
such plan under Rule 12b-1.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants assert that, for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards
of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary and appropriate in
the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 passenger cars not originally
manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation
into the United States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified
version of the 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4), and they are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;006) petitioned NHTSA to determine
whether 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published
notice of the petition on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3923) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader is referred
to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the notice. Based
on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition.

Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 not originally

1971 Ferrari Daytona 365 GTB 4 originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified
under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable of being readily modified to
conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces the availability of funding in the HUD Boston Region for section 8 project-based certificate
(PBC) assistance for one multifamily housing project and a supportive services grant under the HOPE for Elderly Independence
Multifamily Project Demonstration. The Multifamily Project Demonstration must be administered by a public housing
agency or Indian housing authority (HA), and located in a unit of general local government of under 50,000 population.
Selection of an HA to carry out this Demonstration is limited to eligible HAs in the HUD Boston Region which includes
the States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice presents the Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines and announces the availability of funding
of up to $6,172,250 in section 8 budget authority which will support project-based certificate assistance for an
estimated 75 to 150 units. In addition, up to $1,012,500 in supportive services grant funds will be made available
by HUD to the selected HA to provide program participants who are frail elderly persons with services appropriate
to their needs so they may continue to live independently and avoid premature or unnecessary institutionalization.
The selected HA must match the HUD supportive services funds with at least 50 percent of the total cost of the supportive
services estimated to be necessary by the HA and approved by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to determine the feasibility of using section 8 project-based
certificate assistance to assist frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in
a single multifamily housing project specifically designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons,
and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in
the provision of supportive services. The Multifamily Project Demonstration is a five-year demonstration; however,
the initial term of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract is renewable for three additional five-year terms at
the option of the HA and subject to the availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOFA contains information concerning the deadline for filing applications; eligibility of applicants; available
amounts; selection criteria; and the application and selection process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 23 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 requires that any HA receiving additional section 8 rental voucher or certificate
program funding must administer a family self-sufficiency (FSS) program. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs),
participation in the FSS program is optional. The FSS program regulations were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 27, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 49592). Any rental voucher or certificate funding reserved in FY 1993 or subsequently, including funding made
available under this NOFA, will establish or increase the minimum size of an HA's FSS program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA is substantially similar to the NOFA published on September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50768), and withdrawn on November
30, 1993 (58 FR 63181). The principal differences between this NOFA published in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the September 28, 1993 NOFA, are that this NOFA increases the availability of funding with amounts remaining from
the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, and opens up occupancy in the multifamily demonstration
project to near-frail elderly persons, as this term is defined in this NOFA. Although eligible near-frail elderly
persons are permitted to reside in the multifamily project, supportive services grant funds are still restricted
to funding services for only the frail elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA provides for a two-tiered competition based on: (1) The proposal for supportive services and the proposal
to construct or rehabilitate the housing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The competitive selection criteria identified in the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA also increases the fair market rents (FMRs) published April 24, 1991, by two percent per year to adjust for
inflation and corrects the FMRs previously published in Appendix 10 to reflect section 202 FMRs for housing designed
for elderly persons and persons with disabilities.

DATES:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The due date for submission of applications in response to this NOFA is July 5, 1994. Applications must be received
in the local HUD Field Office on the due date by 4:30 p.m. local time. The application deadline is firm as to date and hour
when applications must be submitted to the Field Offices. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants,
HUD will treat as ineligible for consideration any application that is not received on or before the application deadline.
Applicants should take this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of
loss of eligibility brought about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. Application forms
may be obtained from the local HUD Field Office.

(A) Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration is authorized by section 803(h) of the National
Affordable Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 8012) (NAHA). Section 8 project-based certificate (PBC) assistance is governed
by section 8(d)(2)(B) of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act). The Multifamily Project Demonstration differs from
the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, the NOFA for which was published on July 22, 1993 (58
FR 39372), in that the Multifamily Project Demonstration is limited to one multifamily housing project in one HUD
Region and uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 8 PBC assistance instead of tenant-based section 8 rental vouchers or certificates. The Project Guidelines
governing the Multifamily Project Demonstration are consistent with, but not identical to, the Program Guidelines
for the HOPE for Elderly Independence (Nationwide) Demonstration, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 4, 1991 (56 FR 4506), and amended on May 29, 1992 (57 FR 22816). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Multifamily Project Demonstration Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Purpose and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These guidelines implement the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration. The purpose of
the Multifamily Project Demonstration is to test the effectiveness of using section 8 PBC assistance to assist frail
elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons to live independently in a multifamily housing project specifically
designed for occupancy by frail and near-frail elderly persons, and to have frail elderly persons reside in this housing
in sufficient proportion to achieve economies of scale in the provision of needed supportive services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Multifamily Project Demonstration refers to assistance that is attached to units as ``project-based'' assistance
to distinguish this assistance from the ``tenant-based'' assistance provided by the rental voucher program under
the HOPE for Elderly Independence Nationwide Demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With tenant-based assistance, the assisted unit is selected by the family. The HA then enters into an assistance contract,
which only covers a single unit and the specific assisted family. If the family moves out of a unit, the assistance contract
terminates. The family may move with continued assistance under the tenant-based rental voucher program, and may
find a new unit that meets program requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With project-based assistance, the HA enters into an assistance contract for a specific project to make housing assistance
payments for a specified term, provided the unit is occupied by an eligible family and the unit meets program requirements.
To fill vacant project-based units, the HA refers families from its waiting list to the project owner. Because assistance
is tied to the unit, a family that moves from the unit does not have any right to continued assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as otherwise expressly modified or excluded by these Guidelines, the provisions of the section 8 PBC assistance
program regulations (24 CFR part 882, subparts A, B and G apply to the project-based assistance under this Multifamily
Project Demonstration. The following sections in subpart G do not apply to project-based assistance under this demonstration:
&sect;882.702, Additional Definitions; &sect;&sect;882.703 and 882.704 pertaining to HA submission and HUD approval
of HA plans to implement a project-based program; &sect;882.714(b), Fair Market Rent limitation; &sect;882.720
(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2), HA unit selection policy; the provisions of &sect;882.721, Rehabilitation: Initial inspection
and determination of unit eligibility, and &sect;882.723, New construction: HA evaluation and technical processing,
relating to the HA selection of a developer/owner since the owner's proposal is part of the HA application being competitively
selected under this NOFA; and &sect;882.740 (b) and (c), Housing Assistance Payments Contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of the Activities of Daily Living noted above includes a requirement that a person must be able to perform at a specified
minimal level (e.g., to satisfy the eating ADL, the person must be able to feed him/herself). The determination of
whether a person meets this minimal level of performance must include consideration of those services that will be
performed by a person's spouse, relatives or other attendants to be provided by the individual. For example, if a person
requires assistance with cooking, preparing or serving food plus assistance in feeding him/herself, the individual
would meet the minimal performance level and thus satisfy the eating ADL, if a spouse, relative or attendant provides
assistance with feeding the person. Should such assistance become unavailable at any time, the Owner is not obligated
at any time to provide individualized services beyond those offered to the resident population in general. The Activities
of Daily Living analysis is relevant only to determine a person's eligibility for initial occupancy in a subsidized
unit and eligibility to receive supportive services paid for under the Multifamily Project Demonstration, and is
not a determination of eligibility for continued occupancy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Rent reasonableness limitation. The initial contract rent must be reasonable in relation to rents currently
being charged for units in the private unassisted market that are comparable to the newly constructed units or to the
units after they are rehabilitated, taking into account the location, size, structure type, quality, amenities,
facilities, and management and maintenance service of the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The initial contract rent may not exceed rents charged by the Owner for comparable unassisted units and may not exceed
the rents necessary to make the project feasible, as determined by HUD, after taking into account assistance from
other government sources. For an assisted unit that is subject to local rent control, comparable units are rent-controlled
units. However, for an assisted unit that is not subject to local rent control while it is assisted (regardless of whether
the unit would be subject to such control if it were not assisted), comparable units are units that are not subject to
rent-control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a project is financed with a HUD-insured multifamily mortgage, then, in addition to meeting the other requirements
of this paragraph (ii), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial contract rent for each assisted unit shall not exceed an amount determined by HUD to be necessary to amortize
the insured mortgage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Congregate housing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If congregate housing is utilized, the fair market rent for each congregate housing unit shall be the same as for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0-bedroom unit, except that if the unit consists of two or more private rooms, the fair market rent shall be the same
as for a 1-bedroom unit. To qualify as congregate housing, there must be a central kitchen and dining facility with
food service provided by persons other than unit occupants. At least one hot meal each day must be provided in the central
facility. Each unit in congregate housing must contain a living room, a bathroom, and a refrigerator of appropriate
size, although food preparation facilities and a kitchen area are not required in the congregate housing unit. In
determining the reasonableness of the rents, consideration must be given to the presence or absence of common rather
than private cooking, dining, and sanitary facilities, and the provision of special amenities or maintenance and/or
management services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Owner's submission to the HA for inclusion in the application to HUD must contain all of the information required
under the PBC program regulation at 24 CFR 882.720(b)(3). In addition, the Owner's submission must contain a statement
of sources and uses of funds for the development or rehabilitation of the project, and a certification that the assistance,
including adjustments of the contract rent, will not be more than is necessary to make the assisted activity feasible
after taking into account assistance from other government sources.

Participation in the Multifamily Project Demonstration is limited to frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly
persons, as these terms are defined in section I(B)(2) of this NOFA, who: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Qualify as a very low income family (whose income generally does not exceed 50 percent of the median income for the
area); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Are not receiving any form of Federal, State or local housing assistance at the time of expressing an interest
to the HA in participating in the Multifamily Project Demonstration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) General. The HA must establish a Multifamily Project Demonstration selection preference for frail elderly persons
and near-frail elderly persons on the HA's Section 8 waiting list. If there are an insufficient number of eligible
frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly persons on the HA's waiting list who qualify for selection for the Multifamily
Project Demonstration, the HA must advertise for frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicants to be added to the
waiting list. If the HA waiting list is closed, the HA may open its list solely to frail elderly and near-frail elderly
applicants who are willing to reside in the demonstration project, and may also limit the number of applications accepted.
A frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicant who refuses the offer of a unit assisted under this demonstration
may keep his or her place on the waiting list unless the applicant was added to the waiting list in response to a solicitation
for applications from only frail elderly or near-frail elderly applicants willing to reside in the demonstration
project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Supportive services application. Before selecting program participants, the selected HA (with PAC assistance)
shall develop a supportive services application form for frail elderly persons to use in applying for supportive
services under the Multifamily Project Demonstration. The information in the individual's supportive services
application is crucial to the PAC's determination of the need for further physical and/or psychological evaluation
of any individual who wishes to receive the supportive services offered. The application should include: any intake
form, the ADL assessment, and any appropriate comments from both the applicant's physician and the service coordinator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Institutionalization during participation in demonstration. If a program participant is unable to reside
in a dwelling unit in the project assisted under the Multifamily Project Demonstration, due to severe illness or accident
requiring institutionalization, the HA and the PAC, in consultation with the program participant, the participant's
family, and any involved doctors, shall determine whether there is a reasonable expectation that the individual
will be able to return home to live in the dwelling unit. If not, the HA may terminate the individual's eligibility for
the supportive services under this demonstration. The HA must adopt a policy for termination of supportive services
and informal hearing procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Termination of rental assistance and supportive services. Rental assistance shall be terminated only in accordance
with 24 CFR 882.758. If rental assistance is terminated in accordance with Section 8 requirements, the HUD-funded
portion of the supportive services component also is terminated. The program participant shall be provided an informal
hearing in accordance with the procedures in 24 CFR part 882. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supportive services shall be terminated if the participant: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Gains physical and mental health, and is able to function without supportive services, even if only for a short time
(in which case readmission to the supportive services component_based upon reassessment to determine degree of
frailty_is acceptable).

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HA may provide the supportive services directly or subcontract with service providers in the community. The HUD
supportive services grant and the required matching funds may be used only for frail elderly program participants

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) General. HAs applying to carry out the Multifamily Project Demonstration must develop a plan to provide or secure
supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly program participants. This plan should be developed
in consultation with the Area Agency on Aging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Letter from area agency on aging. The plan shall include a letter from the Area Agency on Aging through which the
agency certifies that the costs of the supportive services proposed to be provided are reasonable and consistent
with the cost of other supportive service programs in the jurisdiction of the HA. The letter also must describe the
degree to which the Area Agency has been involved with the planning and proposed operations of the Multifamily Project
Demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Estimate of cost of supportive services during demonstration term. The plan must include an estimate of the
total value of services to be provided over the life of the five-year demonstration period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Maintenance of existing supportive services. The plan shall provide for the maintenance of supportive services
already being provided to frail elderly persons selected to participate in the Multifamily Project Demonstration.
These services will be maintained for the time that the frail elderly person remains in the Multifamily Project Demonstration,
unless the PAC or other entity performing the assessment determines that the services are no longer needed. These
services do not qualify as matching funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchase of additional supportive services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Program participants may purchase additional supportive services from the HA, subject to the agreement of the HA,
at the cost at which the HA must obtain these services, and provided that the provision of these additional supportive
services do not put an undue burden on the management and administration of the demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Matching funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 50 percent match. HUD will provide the selected HA with a supportive service grant that covers 40 percent of the
cost of the necessary supportive services. The frail elderly program participant will cover 10 percent of the cost
of the supportive services (see paragraph (vi) of this paragraph (e)). The selected HA must provide funding from other
sources sufficient to cover the remaining 50 percent of the cost of the supportive services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Certification of committed dollar amounts for first year. The HA must certify that funding for its portion of
the cost of the supportive services has been committed by other sources for the first year of the demonstration with
reasonable assurance that the funding for supportive services will be available during the five-year term of the
contract. The HA will be required to provide such certification annually thereafter for each year of the demonstration,
as part of the annual project/budget review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local governments, third party contributions, available
payments authorized under Medicaid for program participants, grants or subgrants of funds originating from an Area
Agency on Aging under the Older Americans Act and funds from local governments originating from either Community
Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The dollar value of supportive services provided by other agency or third party, or of staff who will work to provide
services to program participants; these services must be justified in the application to assure that they are the
services necessary to keep the frail elderly program participants independent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The dollar value of in-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50 percent matching amount), such as the
current market value of donated furniture, material, supplies, equipment and food used in the provision of supportive
services. The applicant must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item listed and an explanation
of why they are necessary to keep the program participants independent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The value of volunteers to the project at a rate of $5.00 an hour. The value of PAC volunteer time cannot be counted
for any time period estimate related to initial assessment of individuals before they are accepted into the Multifamily
Project Demonstration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) Annual documentation of matching funds. The HA shall supply such documentation of its matching supportive services
cost contribution with each annual budget review in such form as specified by HUD, and explain how any mismatches between
the services committed and those needed by the participants have been corrected. HUD will review the infusion of matching
funds annually, as part of the project/budget review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Insufficient matching funds. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet HUD requirements at
any point after start-up of the Multifamily Project Demonstration, or at any time during the term of the demonstration,
HUD may decrease its share of the supportive services cost in proportion to the amount by which matching funds drop
below 50 percent of total supportive services cost. This adjustment will be done in the year subsequent to the year
of the shortfall, so that the required ratio of HUD to non-HUD funds is maintained. The adjustment may be reconsidered
and canceled by HUD at such time that the HA provides sufficient matching funds to eliminate any shortfall. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Supportive service fee payable by program participant. The HA must ensure that each program participant will
pay at least 10 percent of the cost of the services received, up to a limit of 20 percent of adjusted gross income. This
requirement may be waived by the HA in cases where a program participant does not have any adjusted gross income (income
used to determine family share of rent under the rental certificate regulations). In cases where program participants
are not required to pay a full 10 percent of the supportive service costs, 50 percent of the shortfall will be paid for
from the supportive services grant funds. The balance will be paid for by the HA from other sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Supportive services budget.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The selected HA must submit a supportive services budget for the first year of supportive services delivery, beginning
on the date of initial occupancy of the project, and annually thereafter, on Form SF&hyph;424A, Budget Information_Non-Construction
Programs. Except when there is an unused portion of supportive services funds carried over from the previous year,
the selected HA may not budget more than 20 percent of the supportive services grant amount for any year of the five-year
demonstration. The budget for the first year normally will use less than 20 percent of the funds potentially available,
due to start-up. If this occurs in the first year or in any subsequent year, the HA may exceed the 20 percent limit on the
annual supportive services budget for the succeeding year only by that percentage which represents the amount of
unused supportive services budgeted for the preceding year. The supportive services budget submission is in addition
to the budget documents submitted in accordance with Section 8 rental assistance requirements.

Membership.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As provided in paragraph (b) of this section (10), a PAC is not required to be established by the HA. If established,
the PAC shall be composed of from three-to-seven members appointed by the HA, at least one of which is a qualified medical
professional (e.g., a physician or registered nurse). The service coordinator must be on the PAC. Other members also
must be professionally qualified to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly
persons in relation to the performance of the normal activities of daily living. The HA (e.g., the service coordinator)
may refer to the PAC those elderly applicants, in accordance with the HA's approved program participation selection
process, who are interested in applying for the Multifamily Project Demonstration and have been screened for degree
of frailty or near-frailty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative to formation of PAC.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The selected HA may develop an agreement with community agencies to perform frailty and near-frailty assessments
as an alternative to performing its own screening for frailty and near-frailty and setting up its own PAC. Such an agreement
would include a letter of understanding between the HA and the assessment center stating the roles, responsibilities
and relationship of each to each other. The letter must be signed by the executive officer(s) of both organizations.
This letter must be included in the HA's application to HUD. Such local agencies may include, but are not limited to:
Geriatric Assessment Centers, Public Health and Veterans Administration facilities, County Health Departments,
or similar private agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment of frailty and near-frailty.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PAC (or a community agency with which the HA has a written agreement to perform assessments) will assess the degree
of frailty and near-frailty of elderly persons applying for the Multifamily Project Demonstration, referred to
the PAC (or community agency) by the HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General operating procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A PAC must establish operating procedures and establish case files for each frail elderly person and near-frail elderly
person. The PAC must operate according to the following guidelines: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Recommend to the service coordinator eligibility for entrance to, or transition out of, if applicable, the Multifamily
Project Demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Authorize or perform a medical evaluation, if necessary. This evaluation may be performed by a PAC medical professional,
or the applicant to the Multifamily Project Demonstration may be referred to another agency in the community that
will perform the evaluation without charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Recommend, and update as necessary, a supportive services plan for each frail elderly person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Be furnished with and retain information in files concerning program participants. The files should contain
such information and be maintained in such form that HUD shall require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Present written evaluations to the HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Allow for program participants to appeal decisions related to entrance to, degree of participation needed,
and transition out of the Multifamily Project Demonstration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Specific operating procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the above described general operating procedures, the PAC must:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Perform a formal assessment of each potential program participant's deficiencies in performing the ADLs. This
assessment shall be based upon the screening done by the service coordinator, and shall include a review of the adequacy
of the informal support network (i.e., family and friends available to the potential participant to assist in meeting
the ADL needs of that individual). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Clarify that any program participant needs assistance in at least one ADL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Perform a regular reassessment and updating of the supportive services plan of all frail elderly participants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Replace any member of the PAC within 30 days after such member resigns. A PAC should not perform formal assessments
if its membership drops below three, or if the qualified medical professional leaves the PAC and has yet to be replaced
by the HA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Notify the HA and program participants of any proposed modifications to PAC procedures and provide these parties
with a process and reasonable time period on which to review and comment, prior to adoption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Provide assurance of nondiscrimination in the selection of Multifamily Project Demonstration participants,
with respect to race, religion, color, sex, national origin or type of disability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Provide complete confidentiality of information related to any individual examined, in accordance with the
Privacy Act of 1974. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) In addition to the foregoing, the PAC procedures should ensure that any frail elderly person has the option
of refusing offered services and requesting other supportive services as part of the case planning process. In the
case of refusal of services, the PAC must determine the person's continued ability to live independently without
the recommended service, with this determination being a consideration for the individual's entering into/remaining
in the Multifamily Project Demonstration. In situations where an individual requests additional service(s), not
initially recommended by the PAC, the PAC must make a determination of whether this request is legitimately a needs-based
service which can be covered under the Multifamily Project Demonstration supportive services grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Transition from multifamily project demonstration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The HA/PAC must develop procedures for providing for a program participant's transition out of the Multifamily Project
Demonstration to another setting. Such a transition is based upon the degree of supportive services needed by that
individual to continue to live independently. A program participant may be transitioned out of the Multifamily Project
Demonstration under the following circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Requires a higher level of care than that which can be provided under the Multifamily Project Demonstration; or,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Refuses to pay rent and/or supportive services fees.

II. Application Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Application Submission Deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must be received in the HUD Field Office on July 5, 1994 by 4:30 p.m. local time. The application deadline
is firm as to date and hour. In the interest of fairness to all competing applicants, HUD will treat as ineligible for
consideration any application that is not received on or before the application deadline. Applicants should take
this practice into account and make early submission of their materials to avoid any risk of loss of eligibility brought
about by unanticipated delays or other delivery-related problems. HUD will not accept applications which are sent
via facsimile (FAX) transmission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Threshold Approvable Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only those applications that meet the threshold criteria set forth in section II(C) of this NOFA will be considered
for rating and ranking under section II(D). Applications that meet the threshold criteria will be reviewed, rated
and ranked by the Field Office using the selection criteria and point assignments set forth in section II(D) of this
NOFA. All scored applications and rating sheets in each Field Office will be sent to the Regional Public Housing Director
for Region I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that rating is consistent among the Field Offices, the Office of Public Housing for Region I will
review and may re-rate these applications using the criteria in the NOFA. The highest rated application will be selected
for technical processing by the HUD Field Office (i.e., determination of contract rents; environmental and historic
preservation reviews under 24 CFR part 50; review of previous participation of the principals of the developer/owner;
for projects using low income housing tax credits, subsidy layering review; and for new construction projects, intergovernmental
review under 24 CFR part 52) and, if the application meets program requirements, will be approved by the HUD Field Office.
If the selected application cannot be approved after technical processing is completed, the next highest ranked
application will be selected for technical processing until an approvable application is selected for funding by
HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Threshold Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(1) HA Section 8 Administrative Capability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HA's administrative capability must meet, at a minimum, the following criteria: the Field Office rated the HA's
overall administration of its Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, and Moderate Rehabilitation Programs as good;
any management review, fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review, or Inspector General audit findings
are being satisfactorily addressed; not more than 25 percent of the units inspected by the Field Office during the
last management review failed to meet housing quality standards (HQS) and also failed to meet HQS at the time of the
previous HA inspection, or the Field Office is aware of actions taken by the HA to improve its inspection procedures;
and the leasing rate for rental vouchers and rental certificates under ACC for one year or more was at least 90 percent
as of September 30, 1993, unless the Field Office documents that the September 30, 1993, report is not reflective of
HA performance. In addition, the HA must have prior experience with rehabilitation or development of housing. If
an HA is not administering a Rental Voucher, Rental Certificate, or Moderate Rehabilitation Program, the HA is not
eligible to participate in this demonstration program.

Section 319 of the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C.
1352) (the ``Byrd Amendment'') generally prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from using
appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with
a specific contract, grant, or loan. HUD's regulations on these restrictions on lobbying are codified at 24 CFR part
87. To comply with 24 CFR 87.110, any HA submitting an application under this announcement for more than $100,000 of
budget authority must submit a certification and, if applicable a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities (SF&hyph;LLL
form). Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's
sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment, but IHAs established under State law are not excluded
from the statute's coverage.

V. Other Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD's regulations at
24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332),
at the time of development of the HOPE for Elderly Independence NOFA that was published on September 28, 1993 (58 FR
50769). That Finding remains applicable to this NOFA, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and
5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Federalism Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA, and the accompanying Project Guidelines do not have substantial, direct effects on the States, on
their political subdivisions, or on the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution
of power or responsibilities among the various levels of government. Neither this NOFA nor the accompanying Guidelines
would substantially alter the established roles of HUD, the States and local governments, including HAs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(C) Impact on the Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
NOFA and the accompanying Project Guidelines, may have a significant impact on the maintenance and general well-being
of some families. This NOFA provides FY 1993 funding for, and the accompanying Guidelines provide guidance for the
operation of, the HOPE for Elderly Independence Multifamily Project Demonstration, the purpose of which is to provide
decent and sanitary housing, and supportive services to frail elderly persons and near-frail elderly persons in
a selected multifamily housing project. The supportive services provided by this demonstration are expected to
prevent or postpone unnecessary or premature institutionalization, and reduce unnecessary stress and financial
burden on participants' families. Since the impact on the family is considered beneficial, no further review is necessary.

(D) Accountability in the Provision of HUD Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) contains a number
of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types
of assistance administered by HUD. The regulations implementing section 102 are codified at 24 CFR part 12. On January
16, 1992, HUD published at 57 FR 1942, additional information that gave the public (including applicants for, and
recipients of, HUD assistance) further information on the implementation of section 102. The documentation, public
access, and disclosure requirements of section 102 are applicable to assistance awarded under this NOFA as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Documentation and Public Access 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipient
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these requirements.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Disclosures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in
connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure
reports, but in no case for a period less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will
be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR part 12, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart C, and the notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(E) Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities: The Byrd Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the ``Byrd
Amendment'') and the implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal
contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of
the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding
of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000,
and applicants for Federal commitments exceeding $150,000 must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be
spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs) established
by an Indian tribe as a result of the exercise of the tribe's sovereign power are excluded from coverage of the Byrd Amendment,
but IHAs established under State law are not excluded from the statute's coverage.

(F) Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by HUD and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment
of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units
received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance.
The regulations implementing section 13 are codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
HUD in these ways, they are urged to read these regulations, particularly the examples contained in appendix A to part
86. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions concerning the rule should be directed to the Director, Office of Ethics, room 2158, Department of Housing
and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815
(voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.) Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from the
local HUD office.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 of the Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons not
authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance that entails a competition
for its distribution. HUD's regulations implementing section 103 are codified at 24 CFR part 4. In accordance with
the requirements of section 103, HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding
decisions under a competitive funding process are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information
to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any
applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine
their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD
Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.)
