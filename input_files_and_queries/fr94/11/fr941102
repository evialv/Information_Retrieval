SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense recommended to the Office of Personnel Management that the Detroit, Michigan, Printing
and Lithographic wage schedule be abolished and that the regular Detroit, Michigan, wage schedule apply to printing
employees in Detroit. This recommendation was based on the fact that the Detroit special printing wage survey would
produce special schedule rates lower than the regular schedule rates for the area. Because regulations provide that
the special printing schedule rates may not be lower than the regular schedule rates for an area, special printing
schedule rates for Detroit are currently based on the Detroit regular wage schedule rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Detroit special printing wage survey has become impractical due to the declining number of printing
and lithographic employees available to serve as data collectors in the Detroit wage area. There are only nine covered
employees. No employee's wage rate will be reduced upon conversion to the regular schedule. The Federal Prevailing
Rate Advisory Committee has reviewed this recommendation and by consensus has recommended approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B), I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking.
Also, pursuant to section 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for making this rule
effective in less than 30 days. The notice is being waived and the regulation is being made effective in less than 30
days because preparations for the January 1995 Detroit survey must begin immediately.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been determined to be exempt from the requirements of Executive Order 12866 because it has no adverse
impact on FmHA borrowers or other members of the public and it involves only internal Agency management. It is the policy
of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts shall be published
for comments notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 533 with respect to such rules. This action, however, is not
published for proposed rulemaking since it involves only internal Agency management and publication for comment
is unnecessary.

This document has been reviewed according to 7 CFR, Part 1940, Subpart G, ``Environmental program.'' It is the determination
of FmHA that the proposed action consisting only of accounting changes, does not constitute a major Federal Action
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment and according to the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is amending its regulations governing the disclosure requirements
for offers and sales of national bank securities. This final rule replaces regulations detailing the contents of
offering documents covering national bank securities and requires that offering documents conform to the information
requirements set forth in the appropriate Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration form. The final
rule also cross-references certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and SEC rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the final rule is to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on national banks and enhance their ability
to raise capital, while maintaining the quality of disclosures provided to investors. The final rule generally treats
national bank securities comparably to those of other corporations and eliminates a duplicative and potentially
confusing system of regulations and forms.

The OCC's securities offering regulations protect the purchasers of national bank securities by ensuring that investors
receive full disclosure of all material facts when purchasing such securities, and also protect the integrity of
national bank capital. The OCC determined, however, that revisions to these regulations were needed to reduce unnecessary
burdens that the requirements imposed on national banks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC published a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal), on October 15, 1992, seeking public comment on proposed
revisions to the OCC's regulations governing the offer and sale of national bank securities (57 FR 47,280). The proposal
replaced the OCC's former regulations with a series of regulations based, to the extent appropriate for national
banks, on the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) (15 U.S.C. 77a through 77aa) and the SEC's rules (17 CFR part 230).
The deadline for submitting comments on the proposal originally was December 14, 1992. The OCC extended that deadline
to February 1, 1993 (58 FR 4600), after several potential commenters requested additional time to prepare and submit
comments.

Overview of Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC is issuing this final rule pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 93a. The final rule generally requires national bank securities offering documents to conform to the form for
registration that the bank would use if it had to register the securities under the Securities Act. Accordingly, the
final rule cross-references a number of provisions of the Securities Act and a number of SEC rules. The OCC's former
regulations generally required the disclosure of similar information but in a different format than used by the SEC.
And, unlike the SEC, the OCC did not provide for incorporation by reference of filings made under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) (15 U.S.C. 78a through 78jj). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By conforming its securities disclosure rules to those of the SEC, the OCC believes it can reduce significantly unnecessary
regulatory burden. Banks, bank counsel, and investors are familiar with SEC disclosure requirements. In addition
to being well-known in the marketplace, the interpretation of SEC disclosure requirements is well established and
benefits from a significant body of precedent. Moreover, because the OCC rules will now actually reference the SEC
rules, rather than parallel or copy them, the OCC rules will automatically remain current. Thus, the OCC's adoption
of the SEC registration requirements, while reducing regulatory burden through the elimination of a duplicate (yet
sometimes slightly dissimilar) set of disclosure rules, will maintain the quality of disclosure received by investors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar to the OCC's former regulations, the final rule generally prohibits the offer or sale of bank-issued securities
unless: (1) A registration statement for those securities has been filed with and declared effective by the OCC and
the securities are sold through a prospectus that was filed as a part of that registration statement, or (2) the transaction
is subject to an exemption. The final rule incorporates various SEC exemptions from registration requirements and
adds an exemption for offers and sales of certain large denomination high-grade debt securities to accredited investors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the final rule incorporates through cross-reference the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through
230.263), which sets forth the small issues exemption from registration requirements. Regulation A provides a simplified
disclosure system for offerings of up to $5 million in any 12-month period. The OCC's former regulations included
a similar exemption, but it was limited to offerings of up to $2 million in a 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also includes an abbreviated registration system for offers and sales of large denominations of nonconvertible
debt to accredited investors (defined in 17 CFR 230.501). This abbreviated registration system reduces unnecessary
regulatory burden on offers and sales of such debt in situations where purchasers do not need the more extensive disclosures
provided by the full part 16 registration process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC originally developed the abbreviated registration system through a series of interpretive and no-objection
letters issued under the former part 16. While the SEC rules do not provide for this abbreviated approach, the OCC believes
it is appropriate for several reasons. The market for such debt is well-developed and has not presented particular
disclosure concerns. The requirements that the securities have a specified large denomination, be highly- rated,
and that purchasers must meet the accredited investor criteria further ensure that the debt will only be offered and
sold by a bank in situations when an abbreviated disclosure system is appropriate. Inclusion of this abbreviated
approach in the final rule clarifies its criteria and provides better notice that such a system is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also cross-references the SEC's Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415) on shelf registration. This enables banks
to register securities for future sale and then to sell those securities when market conditions are favorable. Under
the OCC's former regulations, shelf registration was not permitted. This imposed additional and unnecessary costs
on national banks and put them at a disadvantage with respect to other issuers seeking to raise capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule provides that nonpublic offerings of securities generally may be made in accordance with the SEC's
Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 through 230.508). The final rule permits sales to an unlimited number of investors who
meet certain requirements (accredited investors), and up to 35 other sophisticated purchasers, or to any number
of sophisticated purchasers subject to a limitation on the aggregate offering price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cross-reference of the SEC's Regulation D increases the number of allowable purchasers in a nonpublic offering.
The former regulation allowed banks to make nonpublic offerings to only 15 sophisticated purchasers (and an unlimited
number of accredited investors) in a 12-month period, unless the bank received OCC permission to increase the number
of purchasers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised rule makes certain conforming changes to &sect;&sect;5.46 and 5.47 to enable banks to use the SEC's Rule
415 (17 CFR 230.415) on shelf registration. The final rule further provides that a bank need not obtain prior OCC approval
for a cash sale of preferred stock or an issuance of subordinated debt unless the OCC has notified the bank that prior
approval is necessary. The OCC's former regulations required prior OCC approval for all cash sales of preferred stock
and issuances of subordinated debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Interagency Statement on Retail Sales of Nondeposit Investment Products (February 15, 1994) applies to retail
sales of nondeposit investment products including bank securities. Thus, if bank securities are sold to retail customers,
banks must ensure that such customers are fully informed that the securities are not insured by the FDIC, are not deposits
or other obligations of the bank and are not guaranteed by the bank, and are subject to investment risks including possible
loss of the principal invested.

Section-By-Section Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC received 13 comments on the proposal. The commenters generally supported the OCC's plan to incorporate through
cross-reference certain sections of the Securities Act and the SEC's rules thereunder, and to adopt the SEC's forms.
The commenters focused on specific aspects of the revisions that they believed needed modification. The OCC has carefully
considered each of the comment letters and has made a number of changes in response to them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Definitions (Section 16.2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal cross-referenced a number of definitions in the Securities Act. One such definition was the Securities
Act definition of ``underwriter.'' The proposal's cross-reference to the ``underwriter'' definition brought
sales of stock by control persons and affiliates within the coverage of part 16. The former version of part 16 had covered
those sales as indirect sales by a bank. By adopting the Securities Act underwriter definition, the proposal clarified
the coverage of part 16. The final rule adopts the cross-reference to the definition of ``underwriter'' as proposed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also defined ``security'' to conform with the definition in the Securities Act. The proposed definition
was more detailed than the definition in the former part 16, specifying that all bank debt, not just debt subordinated
to the claims of general creditors was considered a security. The definition in the former part 16 was unclear as to
what debt instruments were covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC received six comments on this issue. One commenter favored specifically covering senior debt in the definition
while five commenters were opposed. Several commenters also stated that the definition of ``security'' should exclude
specific traditional bank products and deposits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule includes a cross-reference to the Securities Act definition of ``security.'' That definition clearly
includes senior debt. While a number of banks interpreted the definition of ``security'' in the former part 16 as excluding
senior debt and opposed a change in the definition that they viewed as expanding the coverage of part 16, the OCC believes
there is no reason to treat senior debt differently from subordinated debt for purposes of this definition. Purchasers
of both types of debt should receive the information necessary to make informed investment decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, the passage of the depositor preference provisions of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 (12 U.S.C. 1821(d)(11))
has strengthened the need for purchasers of senior debt to receive disclosure materials. The depositor preference
provisions require the FDIC to pay the claims of uninsured depositors prior to paying the claims of any other general
creditors of a bank. Senior debt, therefore, is not equivalent to uninsured deposits. Purchasers of senior debt now
are less likely than they were prior to the passage of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act to receive full payment in the
event of a bank's insolvency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``security'' in the final rule does not specifically exclude traditional bank products. Nevertheless,
the OCC does not intend that the definition cover insured or uninsured deposits or other traditional bank products,
including letters of credit, banker's acceptances, or repurchase agreements. Judicial precedents have generally
found these instruments 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be securities. Providing an exhaustive list of exceptions in the definition of ``security'' would be unwieldy
and detract from the benefits of cross-referencing the SEC definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Registration Statement and Prospectus Requirements (Section 16.3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 16.3 of the proposal set forth the general prohibitions on offers and sales of bank securities. Under the proposal,
no person could offer or sell bank securities unless a registration statement for the securities had been filed with
and declared effective by the OCC and the offer or sale was accompanied or preceded by a prospectus filed as a part of
that registration statement, or an exemption was available under part 16. The OCC would keep on file and make available
for public inspection the information that was included in the registration statement but not included in the prospectus
provided to shareholders.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC's proposed requirements on the use of a preliminary prospectus and the delivery of a final prospectus differed
from the comparable SEC requirements. The OCC proposal simply incorporated the former part 16 requirements. The
proposal required prior OCC authorization to use a preliminary prospectus. The proposal also required that, except
in a situation where the OCC has authorized the use of a preliminary prospectus, offers must be made through the use
and delivery of a prospectus that has been declared effective by the OCC. Unlike the SEC rules, the proposal did not
generally permit a bank to provide the final prospectus to purchasers with the confirmation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters addressed the OCC's proposed requirements on the use of a preliminary prospectus and the delivery
of a final prospectus. All five commenters agreed that the OCC should follow the Securities Act requirements and SEC
rules. Upon further consideration, the OCC agrees and has revised &sect;16.3 of the final rule to more clearly follow
the requirements in the Securities Act and the SEC rules. The final rule provides that a preliminary prospectus may
be used if (1) a registration statement including the preliminary prospectus has been filed with the OCC; (2) the preliminary
prospectus includes the information required in a final prospectus (except for omission of certain information
dependent on the offering price); and (3) a copy of the final prospectus is furnished to each purchaser prior to or simultaneously
with the sale of the security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Communications Not Deemed an Offer (Section 16.4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal listed a number of communications that the OCC did not deem to be offers and which therefore did not violate
the prohibitions on making offers in &sect;16.3. The list included communications that comply with SEC Rule 134 or
135 (17 CFR 230.134 or 230.135). SEC Rules 134 and 135 govern advertisements used prior and subsequent to the filing
of a registration statement. The proposal also provided that supplemental sales literature could be used after a
registration statement has been declared effective if the sales literature was accompanied or preceded by a prospectus.
In addition, the proposal provided that advertisements only had to be filed with the OCC upon the OCC's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also eliminated certain restrictions on advertisements that were in the former part 16. Former part
16 permitted the use of only extremely limited information in advertisements, such as the name of the bank and the amount
of securities being offered, did not provide for the use of sales literature, and required all advertisements to be
cleared by the OCC prior to use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC received no comments on this section of the proposal. However, the final rule adds to the list of permissible
communications four types of communications that were not in the proposal, but which are permissible under SEC rules.
Those communications include an oral offer of securities covered by a registration statement that has been filed
with the OCC, a summary prospectus that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rule 431 (17 CFR 230.431), a notice of a proposed
unregistered offering that satisfies the requirements of SEC Rule 135c (17 CFR 230.135c), and a communication that
satisfies the requirements of SEC Rules 138 or 139 (17 CFR 230.138 or 230.139_Definition of ``offer for sale'' and
``offer to sell'' in sections 2(10) and 5(c) of the Securities Act in relation to certain publications). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exemptions (Section 16.5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the registration and prospectus requirements did not apply to an offer or sale of securities exempt
under certain sections of the Securities Act or the rules promulgated thereunder. The registration and prospectus
requirements did not apply if the securities were exempt from registration under section 3 of the Securities Act (15
U.S.C. 77c) by reason of an exemption other than those contained in section 3(a)(2) (for securities issued by banks)
or section 3(a)(11) (for intrastate offerings). The proposed registration and prospectus requirements also did
not apply to transactions exempt from registration under section 4 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d). Section
4 of the Securities Act exempts transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter or dealer, transactions
by an issuer not involving a public offering, transactions involving offers or sales by an issuer solely to accredited
investors, and other transactions that meet certain specified requirements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal generally exempted from the &sect;16.3 registration statement and prospectus requirements offers
and sales of bank securities to sophisticated purchasers that satisfy the requirements of SEC Regulation D (17 CFR
230.501 through 230.508). SEC Regulation D sets forth rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without
registration under the Securities Act, providing a safe harbor for compliance with sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities
Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(b) and 77d(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also exempted from the &sect;16.3 registration statement and prospectus requirements offers and sales
of bank issued securities in transactions that satisfy the abbreviated disclosure requirements of certain SEC rules.
Those rules require only limited disclosure to purchasers because of the particular circumstances of the types of
transactions. The rules include Rules 144 (17 CFR 230.144_Persons deemed not to be engaged in a distribution and therefore
not underwriters), 144A (17 CFR 230.144A_Private resales of securities to institutions), 236 (17 CFR 230.236_Exemption
of shares offered in connection with certain transactions), and Regulation S (17 CFR 230.901 through 230.904_Rules
governing offers and sales made outside the United States without registration under the Securities Act of 1933).
In addition, the proposal exempted transactions that complied with the requirements of SEC Rules 701, 702T, and 703T
(17 CFR 230.701, 230.702T, and 230.703T), which cover offers and sales of securities pursuant to certain compensatory
benefit plans and contracts relating to compensation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters largely agreed with the OCC's approach. Two commenters recommended that the OCC also exempt transactions
that comply with the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.263). Regulation A permits unregistered, public
offerings of up to $5 million in securities under certain specified conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule adopts the exemptions from the registration and prospectus requirements included in the proposal,
and also includes an exemption for transactions that comply with Regulation A. (This exemption is discussed further
under ``Small Issues (16.8)'' of this preamble). This approach treats banks comparably to other corporations when
issuing small quantities of securities.

Sales of Nonconvertible Debt (Section 16.6) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal provided an optional abbreviated registration system for offers and sales of nonconvertible debt if
those transactions met certain requirements. Offers and sales that met those requirements were deemed to be in compliance
with the Registration statement and prospectus (16.3), Form and content (16.15), and Periodic and current reports
(16.20) provisions of part 16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, the proposal specified that: (1) The bank issuing the nonconvertible debt must have securities registered
under the Exchange Act or must be a subsidiary of a bank holding company that has securities registered under the Exchange
Act; (2) The insured depository institution subsidiaries of the registered bank holding company must constitute
at least 80% of the bank holding company's assets; (3) The debt must be offered and sold only to accredited investors
(defined in 17 CFR 230.501(a)); (4) The debt must be offered and sold by a reputable and experienced underwriter, not
affiliated with the bank; (5) The debt must be sold in minimum denominations of more than $100,000 and the notes cannot
be exchanged for notes in smaller denominations; (6) The debt must be rated investment quality; (7) Each purchaser
must receive an offering document describing the terms of the debt and incorporating the bank's latest Call Reports
and the bank or holding company's Exchange Act filings; (8) The offering document and any amendments must be filed
with the OCC within five days after first use; and (9) Any required filing fees must be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC designed the requirements of the abbreviated registration system to ensure that potential purchasers of
debt subject to the abbreviated registration system had access to necessary information on the issuing bank and commonly
controlled depository institutions, as well as the appropriate knowledge and experience to evaluate that information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC requested comment on whether this abbreviated registration system was necessary or appropriate. The OCC
received 11 comments on this issue. Although the commenters generally favored the abbreviated registration system,
they expressed different perspectives about the specific requirements of the system. A number stated that the OCC
should eliminate the requirement that nonconvertible debt be sold by an underwriter unaffiliated with the bank.
Several commenters agreed that the OCC needed to revise the abbreviated registration system to address the special
circumstances of federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC agrees with the commenters that the underwriter requirement is unnecessary. The underwriter requirement
imposes additional costs on banks and limits their flexibility without necessarily improving the quality of the
disclosure materials provided to investors. The final rule therefore does not require that the debt be offered and
sold by an underwriter, not affiliated with the bank, as part of an underwritten offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the OCC has determined that it is unnecessary to require that the insured depository subsidiaries of
a registered bank holding company constitute at least 80% of the bank holding company's assets. This asset-based
requirement does not ensure that the holding company's Exchange Act filings would be more meaningful to investors
than the filings would be without the requirement. Accordingly, it has been eliminated from the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the final rule requires that the debt be sold in minimum denominations of $250,000, rather than more than
$100,000, in order to provide additional protections to purchasers of debt. Requiring larger denomination notes,
and preventing them from being broken into smaller denominations, helps ensure that the purchasers of the notes are
sophisticated, high net worth individuals or entities, for whom abbreviated disclosure is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also takes into account the special circumstances of federal branches of foreign banks. Because foreign
banks and their holding companies generally are not reporting companies under the Exchange Act, federal branches
and agencies often would be unable to comply fully with the requirements on Exchange Act filings in the abbreviated
registration system. Federal branches and agencies usually do not have securities registered under the Exchange
Act and are not subsidiaries of holding companies registered under the Exchange Act. Therefore, federal branches
and agencies also cannot incorporate Exchange Act filings into offering documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the final rule provides that federal branches and agencies of foreign banks need not have securities
registered under the Exchange Act or be subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under
the Exchange Act to take advantage of the abbreviated registration system. Instead, these entities may make information
about themselves available to purchasers by filing with the OCC the information specified in SEC Rule 12g3&hyph;2(b)
(17 CFR 240.12g3&hyph;2(b)) and providing purchasers with the information specified in SEC Rule 144A(d)(4)(i)
(17 CFR 230.144A(d)(4)(i)). The OCC believes that this information is adequate for the sophisticated purchasers
who are eligible investors under the abbreviated disclosure system. Such purchasers also are able to determine whether
they have sufficient information to make informed investment decisions, and if they do not, can request additional
information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal permitted offers and sales without compliance with the registration statement and prospectus requirements
of &sect;16.3 if the offers and sales were made in accordance with SEC Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501 through 230.508)
and the purchasers were either accredited investors or ``sophisticated'' investors. SEC Regulation D sets forth
rules governing the limited offer and sale of securities without registration under the Securities Act and provides
a safe harbor for compliance with sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77c(b) and 77d(2)). SEC Regulation
D does not require that in all circumstances purchasers be sophisticated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal's cross-reference of Regulation D increased the number of purchasers permitted in a nonpublic offering
over the number allowed under the former part 16. Former part 16, as interpreted by the OCC, permitted sales to only
15 sophisticated purchasers (and an unlimited number of accredited investors), unless the seller received OCC permission
to increase the number of purchasers. The proposal permitted sales to 35 sophisticated purchasers and an unlimited
number of accredited investors, or to any number of sophisticated purchasers subject to a limitation on the aggregate
offering price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal required the filing of a notice of sales no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in accordance
with SEC Rule 503 of Regulation D. Under the former part 16, nonpublic offering notices had to be filed 20 days prior
to the time any security was offered or sold. This proposed change gave banks added flexibility in the timing of sales

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, securities subject to the limitations on resale of Regulation D must be sold pursuant to SEC Rule
144 or 144A, another exemption from registration under the Securities Act, or in accordance with the part 16 registration
and prospectus requirements. The former part 16 did not permit any securities sold in a nonpublic offering to be resold
for two years. The proposed change in resale limitations would improve the marketability of bank securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC received two comments on this section of the proposal. One commenter supported the cross-reference of Regulation
D. The other commenter believed that by including the notice requirement in the nonpublic offering section, the OCC
was making the filing of a notice a condition to the availability of the nonpublic offering exemption. The commenter
stated that while the SEC does provide for the filing of a notice, it is not a condition of any of the exemptions in Regulation
D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule adopts this section as proposed with certain clarifying changes. The final rule indicates more clearly
that although the filing of a notice is required, failure to file a notice does not result in the loss of the nonpublic
offering exemption. Thus, the notice is not a condition of any of the exemptions in Regulation D. The final rule also
clarifies that offers and sales made in reliance on Regulation D must only be made to sophisticated purchasers.

The proposal did not cross-reference the SEC's Regulation A (17 CFR 230.251 through 230.264), which permits the unregistered,
public offering of securities under specified conditions. The OCC requested comment as to whether it should cross-reference
Regulation A and received two comments in response. Both commenters believed that the OCC should cross-reference
Regulation A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these comments, the OCC has decided to cross-reference Regulation A in the final rule. Given the criteria
for use of the rule, the OCC does not believe its use reduces purchaser safeguards. Moreover, the OCC believes that
the Regulation A small issues exemption from registration should be available to banks, as it is to other issuers,
to prevent imposing unnecessary burdens on banks in connection with small securities issuances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to use the Regulation A exemption, an issuer's offering documents must be filed with and reviewed by the OCC.
The final rule states that filers should consult the SEC's Securities Act Industry Guide 3_Statistical Disclosure
by Bank Holding Companies (17 CFR 229.801(c) and 231) for guidance on the appropriate disclosures to be included in
the offering document. The Guide 3 disclosures consist of information that potential purchasers of bank securities
need in order to evaluate their investments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal required all registration statements filed with the OCC to be on the form for registration that the bank
would use were it required to register the securities under the Securities Act. Which form a bank uses depends, among
other things, on whether the bank is subject to the registration and reporting requirements of section 12 or 15(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 78o(d)) and on the amount of the offering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters suggested that the OCC clarify whether a national bank may use the SEC's Form S&hyph;3 (Form for
registration under the Securities Act of securities of certain issuers offered pursuant to certain types of transactions)
in connection with the offer and sale of its securities if its parent company meets the requirements set forth in Instruction
I.C. to Form S&hyph;3 and the other requirements set forth in Instruction I.C. are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule permits national banks to use Form S&hyph;3 in such situations. Pursuant to Instruction I.C. to the
SEC's Form S&hyph;3, if the parent of a registrant meets the registration requirements for the use of Form S&hyph;3,
the registrant may use Form S&hyph;3 for offers and sales of nonconvertible debt or nonconvertible preferred stock
provided the registrant is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent and the securities being issued by the registrant
are investment grade securities (or are fully guaranteed by the qualifying parent as to principal and interest).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A national bank may establish an Exchange Act disclosure base for the Form S&hyph;3 by registering its common stock
on Form 10 (General form for registration of securities pursuant to section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act) prior
to the effectiveness of its offering document and incorporating by reference the form pursuant to Item 12(a)(1) of
Form S&hyph;3 in lieu of a Form 10&hyph;K (General form of annual report). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also required that the registration statement must meet the requirements of the SEC regulations referred
to in the registration form. Those regulations include Regulation S&hyph;X (17 CFR part 210), which applies to financial
statements, and Regulation S&hyph;K (17 CFR part 229), which applies to the nonfinancial statement portion of the
registration statement. The OCC expects that, consistent with SEC requirements and practice, filers will prepare
registration statements for bank securities in accordance with Securities Act Industry Guide 3_Statistical Disclosure
by Bank Holding Companies (17 CFR 229.801(c) and 231). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposal required registration statements to satisfy the requirements of the SEC regulations referred
to in the applicable registration form, the financial statements in the registration statements must be audited.
The OCC sought comment on whether it should limit the requirement for audited financial statements to banks of a certain
size and whether that size should be the cut-off for the requirement for annual independent audits that was established
pursuant to section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (12 U.S.C.
1831m). Several commenters stated that the OCC should limit the audited financial statements requirement to banks
of a certain size, although they disagreed as to what that size should be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, the OCC has decided not to limit the audited financial statements requirement to
banks of a certain size. The final rule requires audited financial statements from national banks to the same extent
that the SEC requires audited financial statements of other corporations. Requiring banks to provide audited financial
statements in their registration statements helps ensure that purchasers of bank stock receive the same quality
of disclosure and the same protections as do purchasers of stock of other types of issuers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposal required registration statements to comply with the SEC regulations referenced in the applicable
registration form, banks that were subsidiaries of holding companies had to include audited bank financial statements,
rather than bank holding company statements, in their registration statements. However, a number of commenters
felt that banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act
should not have to include audited bank financial statements in their registration statements. The commenters stated
that these banks should instead be allowed to include in their registration statements the audited financial statements
contained in the holding companies' Exchange Act filings and the banks' Call Reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC disagrees, and the final rule requires banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies to include audited
bank financial statements in registration statements for bank securities. The OCC believes that purchasers of bank
securities that are not subject to any sophistication requirements should be provided with bank, not merely holding
company, financial statements. Those purchasers need bank level financial statements in order to make informed
investment decisions about bank securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal cross-referenced the requirements of Rule 400 and Articles 1&hyph;3 of the SEC's general rules on registration
in SEC Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.439). Regulation C includes the SEC rule on shelf registration in Rule
415 (17 CFR 230.415_Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities). Shelf registration enables banks to
register securities that are to be sold in the future and then to sell those securities when the market conditions are
most favorable. Regulation C also includes SEC Rule 430A (17 CFR 230.430A_Prospectus in a registration statement
at the time of effectiveness). Rule 430A allows an issuer to file a prospectus that omits certain information dependent
on the offering price. The former part 16 did not contain any provisions comparable to Rule 415 or Rule 430A, so price
and other information had to be set at the time an offering document was filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, like the proposal, cross-references the requirements of Rule 400 and Articles 1&hyph;3 of the SEC's
general rules on registration in SEC Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.439). However, the final rule also cross-references
the other articles of Regulation C (17 CFR 230.445 through 230.497). The OCC is cross-referencing the remaining articles
of Regulation C in order to adopt the SEC's rules and procedures governing when registration statements and amendments
become effective. (For a discussion of this matter

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Effectiveness (&sect;16.16)'' in this preamble). These remaining articles include rules on delaying amendments
and acceleration of the effective date that are integral to the procedures under which registration statements and
amendments become effective.

Effectiveness (Section 16.16)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal did not provide for the adoption of the Securities Act provisions or the SEC's rules pertaining to when
registration statements become effective. The proposal retained the requirement in former part 16 that no registration
statement, prospectus, or amendment was effective until declared effective by the OCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one commenter discussed this issue. That commenter urged that the OCC follow the SEC's procedures in this area.
The OCC agrees and the final rule adopts the Securities Act provisions and the SEC's rules on effectiveness. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 discussion under ``Form and Content (&sect;16.15)'' in this preamble.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the cross-referenced provisions of the Securities Act, registration statements automatically become effective
20 days after they are filed unless a delaying amendment is filed with the OCC. However, consistent with SEC practice,
the OCC expects all filers to file delaying amendments with their registration statements to prevent the registration
statements from becoming automatically effective. The delaying amendments will ensure that the OCC has adequate
time to review and comment upon filings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the proposal specified that issuers must file four copies of all documents with the OCC and required
the OCC to make those documents available for public inspection. The former part 16 required issuers to submit six
copies of most documents. The proposal also specified that all notices or other documents required to be filed by any
section of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or a rule of the SEC cross-referenced in part 16, be filed with the OCC.
The final rule adopts this section generally as proposed, with a few technical clarifying changes.

Under the proposal, a prospectus or amendment declared effective by the OCC may not be used more than nine months after
its effective date unless the information contained therein is as of a date not more than 16 months prior to the date
of use. This section of the proposal was based on the requirement in section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C.
77j(a)(3)) pertaining to the age of information in a prospectus. The proposal provided more time for an offering to
be completed than did former part 16. Former part 16 allowed an offering circular to be effective for a period of only
six months, although the OCC could extend the six month period for two consecutive 90 day periods upon request. In the
event there was a material change after a prospectus has been declared effective, the proposal prohibited use of the
prospectus until an amendment reflecting the change had been filed with and declared effective by the OCC.

The proposed rule allowed filers to withdraw a registration statement and amendments prior to the effective date.
It also stated that the OCC could determine that a registration statement and amendments had been abandoned if they
had been on file for nine months and not become effective. Documents withdrawn or declared abandoned would be so marked
but would remain in the OCC files. The final rule adopts this section as proposed, with minor clarifying changes.

Current and Periodic Reports (Section 16.20) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal required banks that had filed registration statements declared effective pursuant to part 16 to file
with the OCC periodic and current reports until the banks were eligible to suspend the filing of those reports. This
requirement was based on that imposed by section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)) on corporations filing
Securities Act registration statements with the SEC. The filing of periodic and current reports ensures that current
information about an issuer is available for a period after an offering of securities is made. The periodic and current
reporting requirements cease the year after the registration statement becomes effective, if the issuer is not otherwise
required to register its securities under the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal further provided that a bank need not comply with the periodic and current reports requirements if the
bank was a subsidiary of a one-bank holding company and the bank's parent bank holding company filed current and periodic
reports pursuant to section 13 of the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters stated that all banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered
under the Exchange Act should be able to rely on holding company Exchange Act filings and bank Call Reports to fulfill
the current and periodic report requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule permits banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under the
Exchange Act to rely on holding company Exchange Act filings and bank Call Reports to fulfill the current and periodic
reports requirements in specified circumstances. A bank need not file current and periodic reports if the bank is
a subsidiary of a one-bank holding company, the financial statements of the bank and the parent bank holding company
are substantially the same, and the bank's parent bank holding company files periodic and current reports pursuant
to section 13 of the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC believes that when these conditions are met, the holding company's current and periodic reports will provide
the marketplace with information equivalent to what would be provided if the holding company's subsidiary bank made
separate reports. The OCC concluded that any broader exception would not be appropriate because the information
provided is used in markets including both sophisticated and unsophisticated investors. In the case of the latter,
they may not have sufficient financial expertise to evaluate information that differs substantially from the type
and scope of disclosure that would have been contained in current and periodic reports filed by the bank itself.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal set forth the requirements that a person must meet to obtain interpretive advice or a no-objection letter
under part 16. Although these requirements are not detailed in former part 16, the OCC based them on Banking Circular
205, OCC Staff No-Objection Positions, which has been in effect since July 26, 1985. The final rule adopts this section
as proposed, with minor clarifying changes.

The proposal required the use of an independent escrow account if the funds received in an offering were to be certified
as capital or if there was a minimum amount to be sold in an offering. One commenter opposed this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule modifies the escrow requirements. Section 16.31 of the final rule allows the OCC to require any funds
received through an offer or sale of securities to be held in an independent escrow account at an unrelated insured
depository institution when the OCC determines it is in the best interest of the shareholders. A bank does not have
to use an independent escrow account unless the OCC has notified the bank that an escrow account is necessary. However,
the OCC generally expects banks to use independent escrow accounts.

The proposal prohibited untrue statements of material fact, omissions of material fact, and acts or practices that
operate as a fraud in the offer or sale of a bank security. The language in this section of the proposal was substantially
similar to the language in section 17(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77q). The section 17(a) prohibitions apply
to offers and sales of bank securities regardless of whether the prohibitions are restated in part 16. The OCC believed
that restating the prohibitions in part 16 furnished warning that the prohibitions apply. The proposal further provided
that violations of the fraudulent transactions section also constitute unsafe or unsound practices under 12 U.S.C.
1818. This section of the final rule is adopted as proposed.

The proposal included a conforming amendment to 12 CFR 5.33(b)(6)(ii) which requires that all shareholders in a merger

to add that a bank required to file a registration statement with the OCC may use that registration statement to comply
with the proxy statement requirements set forth in &sect;5.33(b)(6)(ii). In addition, a bank subsidiary of a holding
company required to file a registration statement with the SEC may use that registration statement to comply with
OCC proxy statement requirements. The final rule adopts the conforming amendment to &sect;5.33(b)(6)(ii) as proposed,

Changes in Equity Capital (Section 5.46) and Subordinated Debt as Capital (Section 5.47) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal did not include any changes to 12 CFR 5.46 and 5.47. Former &sect;5.46 required OCC preliminary approval
for a change in capital due to a sale of preferred stock. Former &sect;5.46 further specified that changes in equity
capital must occur within 12 months of seeking preliminary approval. Former &sect;5.47 required OCC approval for
subordinated debt that is to be considered part of a bank's capital structure; a bank must receive preliminary approval
prior to the issuance of subordinated debt and the subordinated debt must be issued within 12 months of the preliminary
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC requested comment on whether &sect;&sect;5.46 and 5.47 needed to be modified in order to enable banks to use
the SEC rule on shelf registration in Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415_Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities).
Shelf registration permits banks to register securities that are to be sold in the future and then to sell those securities
when the market conditions are most favorable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC received four comments on this issue. All of the commenters stated that because of the delays caused by the preliminary
approval requirements in &sect;&sect;5.46 and 5.47, the OCC needed to amend those requirements in order for banks
to take advantage of SEC Rule 415. The OCC agrees and has adopted a final rule that includes changes to &sect;&sect;5.46
and 5.47. The changes will enable most banks to use the SEC's rule on shelf registration and thereby reduce unnecessary
regulatory burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As adopted in the final rule, &sect;5.46 no longer requires a bank to obtain preliminary approval of cash sales of preferred
stock unless the OCC has notified the bank that preliminary approval is necessary. After selling preferred stock,
a bank still must obtain final approval and certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule also changes the approval procedures in &sect;5.47 for the issuance of subordinated debt. Under the
new procedures, a bank need not obtain prior approval to issue subordinated debt unless the OCC has notified the bank
that prior approval is necessary. A bank that has not been notified that it must obtain prior approval to issue subordinated
debt must notify the OCC after issuing debt that is to be counted as tier 2 capital. Subordinated debt will qualify as
tier 2 capital if it meets the requirements set forth in 12 CFR part 3, Appendix A section 2(b)(4) and complies with the
OCC Guidelines for Subordinated Debt Instruments in the Comptroller's Manual for Corporate Activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A bank need not submit a letter of intent and obtain preliminary approval prior to selling preferred stock for cash
unless the Office has notified the bank that preliminary approval is necessary. Any bank selling preferred stock
must submit a letter of notification pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section to obtain final approval and certification.
The Office must review and may approve provisions in articles of association concerning preferred stock dividends,
voting and conversion rights, retirement, and rights to exercise control over management. A bank may submit those
provisions for review and approval with the letter of notification.

Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) A bank must submit to the appropriate District office by hand or by mail, return receipt requested, a letter of intent
to change capital. The bank must receive preliminary approval for any change in capital except for a stock dividend,
a cash sale of common stock, a cash sale of preferred stock where the bank has not been notified by the Office that preliminary
approval is required, or a reduction in par value of common stock that does not change the sum of capital and capital
surplus. Stock dividends, cash sales of common stock, cash sales of preferred stock where the bank has not been notified
by the Office that preliminary approval is required, or reductions in par value of common stock that do not change the
sum of capital and capital surplus are subject only to the notification process described in paragraphs (g)(2) and
(g)(3) of this section. For other changes in equity capital, the bank must submit a letter of intent describing the
type and amount of the proposed change, and state if the bank is subject to a capital plan with the Office. If the bank
is subject to a capital plan or if a capital plan is required in connection with the proposed change in equity capital,
the bank must state how the proposed change conforms to the plan. The bank may consider its proposed change preliminarily
approved 30 days after the day on which the Office receives the letter of intent, unless the bank is notified that preliminary
approval is delayed, conditioned, or denied. The bank should submit the letter of intent and receive preliminary
approval prior to seeking shareholder approval. The bank may proceed with an increase in capital after preliminary
approval is received; however, it may not reduce its capital or make a distribution until it has received final Office
approval as specified in paragraphs (g)(2) and (g)(3) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These rules are intended to implement the simplified notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures recently established under section 346 of the Riegle Community 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 for bank holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies proposing to engage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 or through an acquisition in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonbanking activities. Because Section 346 implements this procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take effect immediately and will apply to all notices filed subsequent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enactment of Section 346. The Board also is seeking comments on the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden associated with its application and notice procedures, and the Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives.

 Section 4 of the Bank Holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1843) (BHC Act) prohibits bank holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies from acquiring or retaining shares of any company that is not a bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or engaging in any activity other than managing and controlling banks, except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under certain circumstances. The primary exception permits bank holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies to conduct activities and acquire companies engaged solely in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities the Board has determined to be closely related to banking and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

section 4 of the BHC Act to establish a new notice procedure for obtaining Board approval under sections 4(a)(2) and
4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Under Section 346, a proposal requiring Board approval under section 4(a)(2) or 4(c)(8) may be consummated 60 days
after providing the Board with a complete written notice of the proposal, unless the notice period is extended as provided
in the statute. Section 346 also permits proposals to be consummated at anytime during this notice period if approved
by the Board during this period.

Section 346 establishes a notice procedure for situations in which prior Board approval is required under section
4(c)(8) or 4(a)(2) of the BHC Act, and was not intended to impose any new approval requirements on transactions that
may otherwise be consummated under section 4 of the BHC Act without Board approval.

Notice Procedure Under Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement these statutory changes, the Board proposes to amend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation Y to replace the application procedures for obtaining approval to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engage in nonbanking activities with a notice procedure. The interim rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplates action by the Reserve Bank on nonbanking proposals involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed activities within 30 days after a notice containing all of the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required in the rule has been received by the Reserve Bank, in cases that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for Reserve Bank action, and within 60 days of that date in cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving any previously approved activity that are subject to Board action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the rule also indicates that the Board will seek to act on notices involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new activities within 60 days of receipt of the notice by the Reserve Bank, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals that involve activities that have not been previously approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board often require substantial information and may continue to require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater processing period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule specifies the different types of information required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals to engage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in listed activities, proposals to acquire a company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaged in listed activities, and proposals to engage in activities not previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by regulation (``unlisted activities''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Listed Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule contemplates that proposals to engage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de novo 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquire a company engaged in a listed activity will be approved within 30 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the original date of filing of the notice, even if additional information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequently requested by the Reserve Bank or the Board. Upon receipt of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice to engage in or to acquire a company engaged in a listed activity (or an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity previously approved by order), the Reserve Bank shall immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the Board, and the Board will publish notice of the proposal in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 inviting public comment for a period of 15 days. Within 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar days after receipt by the Reserve Bank of a notice filed under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interim rule, the Reserve Bank must approve the notice, extend the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for 15 calendar days, or refer the notice to the Board for decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because a substantive comment on the proposal has been received or action on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice by the Reserve Bank is not appropriate. The Reserve Bank also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice, return the notice if it is

Unlisted Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As is the practice under the current rules, proposals to engage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities not previously approved by the Board by regulation or order will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published by the Board in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 within 10 business days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance by the Reserve Bank, unless the Board determines to extend this 10-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day period for an additional 30 days. Public notice of proposals to engage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such new activities shall invite comment for a period of generally 30 days, or if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Board determines that the notificant has not adequately demonstrated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed activity is so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereto, the Board may return the notice and explain the reasons for its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule provides that the Board will attempt to act on all cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred for Board action within 60 days of the date the notice is received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Reserve Bank. As noted above, proposals that involve new activities that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been previously approved by the Board are likely to require a greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing period. In the event the Board does not act on the notice within 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days of receipt by the Reserve Bank, the Board will notify the bank holding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
company, and explain the reasons for needing additional time as well as provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an anticipated date by which the Board expects to act on the notice.

Elimination of Pre-Acceptance Review Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the interim rule eliminates the pre-acceptance review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure currently contained in Regulation Y for proposals to engage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonbanking activities. This procedure established a defined period of up to 28 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days during which an applicant and the Reserve Bank could identify and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address significant issues prior to the filing of a final application. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure has been particularly beneficial to the processing of complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposals and applications to engage in activities not previously approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Board by regulation or order, where information requests often must be tailored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the specific proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the elimination of pre-acceptance procedures should shorten the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review process, the Board recognizes the utility of a pre-acceptance procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and anticipates that there will be certain proposals that could benefit from some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form of pre-acceptance review. The Board invites comments as to whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some form of pre-notice review procedure should be reinstated in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation Y currently provides that (with the exception of proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed under the abbreviated procedure for small acquisitions) all proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to engage in previously approved nonbanking activities must be published in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and provide for a public comment period of not more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days. Under the interim rule, the public comment period has been shortened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 30 days to 15 days for proposals to engage in activities previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the Board by regulation or order. The interim rule also provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Reserve Bank may not act on a notice before the fifth business day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the close of the public comment period unless an emergency exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring expedited or immediate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 346 authorizes the Board to prescribe shorter notice periods by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation for particular activities or transactions. The Board invites comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on whether further shortening of the comment period is appropriate, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for notices to engage in activities previously approved by the Board. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, the Board requests comment on a proposal to reduce the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period to 5 calendar days for proposals that involve listed activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or activities that have been previously approved by Board order. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would enable the Reserve Banks to act on proposals that raise no substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues well within the 30-day target.

Statutory Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule incorporates the provisions of Section 346 that establish the permissible length of the notice period.
Under the interim rule, a notice is deemed approved by operation of law 60 days after receipt of a complete notice, unless
extended as provided in Section 346. As provided in the statute, the interim rule provides that a notice is deemed complete
when it contains all information required in the interim rule and all other information requested by the Board or the
Reserve Bank in connection with the notice. The Board may extend the notice period for an additional 30 days upon notice
to the bank holding company. If the proposal involves an unlisted activity, the Board may extend the notice period
for a 90-day period in addition to the 30-day extension, provided the Board notifies the bank holding company and explains
the reasons for this additional extension. Further extensions are only permissible in the event the Board determines
to conduct a hearing on the proposal, or the notificant has consented to an extension or tolling of the notice period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule adopts the provision in Section 346 that permits the Board to request additional information about
a proposal at any time during the notice period. The rule also includes the provision of Section 346 that provides that
the Board may deny any notice if the notificant neglects, fails, or refuses to furnish the Board all the information
required by the Board.

Abbreviated Notice Procedure for Small Acquisitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The interim rule retains the current abbreviated notice procedure contained in Regulation Y for small acquisitions
of assets or shares of companies engaged in activities previously approved by the Board by regulation.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, this abbreviated notice procedure may be used for acquisitions where neither the book value of the assets
to be acquired nor the gross consideration to be paid for the securities or assets exceeds the greater of (i) $15 million
or (ii) 5 percent of the consolidated assets of the acquiring company up to a maximum of $100 million. The interim rule
retains this abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions of companies engaged in laundry list activities,
and increases the size limitation for acquisitions that qualify for this procedure from a maximum of $100 million
to a maximum of $300 million.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This procedure is only available to bank holding companies that meet the Board's Capital Adequacy Guidelines and
are proposing to acquire a company engaged in activities for which the bank holding company has previously received
System approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary benefit of the abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions is the shortened approval process
realized by opting to publish public notice of the proposal in local newspapers in the communities affected by the
proposal. Since this provision of Regulation Y was adopted, notificants have increasingly opted to publish notice
of the proposed acquisition in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to conduct the nonbanking activity nationwide or throughout a geographic area so large that public notice
of the proposal by means of local newspaper publication is unduly expensive or impracticable. Moreover, the streamlined
notice procedure established by the interim rule would effectively shorten the notice period for all acquisitions
involving listed activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of this, the Board invites comment as to whether the abbreviated notice procedure for small acquisitions
should be retained, eliminated, or amended.

Simplified Notice Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that these proposals will substantially reduce the burden associated with the approval requirement
under section 4 of the BHC Act without resulting in unsafe and unsound banking practices. Because the provisions of
Section 346 are implemented immediately, the Board is proposing to adopt the following regulation as an interim rule
in connection with nonbanking activities conducted pursuant to section 4 of the BHC Act. The Board invites comments
on all aspects of this interim rule, and will amend this rule as needed to reflect the comments received. The Board also
invites suggestions on other means of reducing the regulatory burden associated with the System's application and
notices procedures.

), the Board does not believe that these changes will have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. This interim rule will reduce the regulatory burden on bank holding companies imposed by the Board's
procedures, and the Board is inviting public comment on additional ways to reduce regulatory burden.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating a notice under &sect;225.23, the Board shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider whether the performance by the notificant of the activities can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public (such as greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency) that outweigh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible adverse effects (such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
managerial resources of the notificant, including its subsidiaries, and any

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 These rules implement the streamlined notice procedure recently enacted in Section 319 of the Riegle Community Development
and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (``Riegle Act'') for the formation of a new bank holding company that results
from a corporate reorganization of a bank by the current shareholders of the bank. These rules also implement section
321 of the Riegle Act, which amends the Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to authorize the Board to shorten
the post-approval waiting period for bank acquisitions and mergers (during which time the United States Attorney
General may review the competitive effects of a proposal approved by the Board) from 30 to 15 days with the consent of
the United States Attorney General. Because the procedures prescribed by section 319 and section 321 are effective
immediately, the Board has proposed the following as an interim rule that will take effect immediately. The Board
is seeking comments on this interim rule, and will amend the rule as needed to address the comments received. The Board
also is currently developing additional initiatives to reduce the regulatory burden associated with its application
and notice procedures, and invites comment on any suggestions in furtherance of these initiatives.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 3(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (12 U.S.C. 1842(a)) (``BHC Act'') requires Federal Reserve Board
approval prior to consummating certain transactions resulting in the formation of a bank holding company, or in the
acquisition by a bank holding company of shares or control of a bank, subject to certain exceptions. Section 319 of
the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;325, section 319,
108 Stat. 2160, 2224 (1994)(``Section 319'')) amends section 3 of the BHC Act to establish a notice procedure for the
formation of a new bank holding company resulting from a corporate reorganization that involves substantially the

 In connection with section 319, section 320 of the Riegle Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act of 1933 for securities issued by a bank holding company pursuant to such a reorganization.

Section 319 also amends section 5(d)(3) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1815(d)(3))_commonly referred
to as the ``Oakar Amendment''_to eliminate the requirement for prior Board approval of transactions by banks owned
by holding companies to merge with thrift institutions. Under the Riegle Act, Oakar transactions continue to require
the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the acquiring institution, and all Oakar transactions
must comply with section 3(d) of the BHC Act, the ``Douglas Amendment.'' No amendments to the Board's regulations
are needed to implement these amendments to section 5(d)(3).

321'') permits the Board, with the consent of the U.S. Attorney General, to shorten the post-approval waiting period
for bank acquisitions and mergers from 30 days to 15 days. The interim rule implement the provisions enacted in sections
319 and 321 of the Riegle Act. Comment is invited on all aspects of these proposals.

 applies only if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the formation of a new bank holding company may be consummated
30 days after providing written notice to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank if: (1) The shareholders of the bank
will acquire, as a result of the reorganization, the shares of the newly formed bank holding company in substantially
the same proportional interest as they held in the bank; (2) the bank holding company would meet, and its resulting
subsidiary bank would meet, certain financial and capital standards; (3) the bank holding company would not, as a
result of the reorganization, acquire other banking or nonbanking interests; and (4) during the 30-day notice period,
the Reserve Bank or the Board does not object to the proposal.

Substantially the Same Shareholders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the interim rule, the requirement that shareholders of the bank acquire ``substantially the same share interest''
in the newly formed bank holding company would be met by proposals in which the shareholder or shareholders who lawfully
control at least 80 percent of the shares of the bank at the time the notice is filed would acquire, immediately after
the reorganization, at least 80 percent of the shares of the holding company in substantially the same proportion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By the terms of Section 319, allowance is made for changes in shareholders' interests resulting from the exercise
of dissenting shareholders' rights under State or Federal law. Accordingly, under the interim rule, a shareholder
of the bank will be considered to have substantially the same proportional interest in the holding company (notwithstanding
a change in the percentage of shares controlled by the shareholder) if the shareholder interest increases, on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis, as a result of either the redemption by the bank or bank holding company of shares from dissenting shareholders,
or as a result of the acquisition of shares of dissenting shareholders by the remaining shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this notice procedure would not be available in cases in which any shareholder or group of shareholders acting
in concert would, following the reorganization, own or control 10 percent or more of any class of voting shares of the
bank holding company unless that shareholder or group of shareholders was authorized, after review under the Change
in Bank Control Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 1817(j)) by the appropriate Federal banking agency for the bank, to own or control
10 percent or more of any class of voting shares of the bank. Similarly, this procedure is not available in cases in which
the exercise of dissenting shareholders' rights would cause a company that is not a bank holding company (other than
the company in formation) to be required to register as a bank holding company. This procedure also is not available
for the formation of a bank holding company organized in mutual form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board seeks comment on other alternative formulations consistent with the statutory mandate that the reorganization
involve substantially the same shareholders.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 319 also establishes certain financial thresholds that must be satisfied to qualify for the abbreviated
notice procedure. In particular, the bank to be reorganized must, at the time the notice is filed, be ``adequately
capitalized,'' as this term is defined in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. See 12 U.S.C. 1831o. In addition,
Section 319 requires that the bank holding company resulting from the reorganization meet any ``capital and other
financial standards'' established by the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim rule, the Board has established three requirements designed to identify reorganization proposals
that do not raise financial or supervisory concerns that would benefit from review and explanation through an application
process rather than an abbreviated notice procedure. Under the interim rule, a proposal to form a new one-bank holding
company would qualify for the abbreviated notice procedures established in Section 319 if: (1) The bank has received
at least a composite ``satisfactory'' rating at its most recent examination, in the event that the bank has been subject
to examination; (2) the amount of debt that the bank holding company would assume at the time of the reorganization,
and the proposed means of retiring this debt, would not place undue burden on the holding company or its subsidiary
on a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis;
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and (3) at the time of the reorganization, neither the bank nor any of its officers, directors or shareholders is involved
in any unresolved supervisory or enforcement matters with any appropriate Federal banking agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To begin the notice period under the interim rule, the notificant organization must submit to the appropriate Reserve
Bank a written notice that includes: (1) Certification that the requirements of Section 319 and the Board's implementing
rule are met by the proposal; (2) a list of the shareholders of the bank prior to the reorganization and of the holding
company following the reorganization, identifying the percentage of shares held by each shareholder in the bank
and proposed to be held in the new holding company; (3) a description of the resulting management of the proposed bank
holding company and its subsidiary bank, including (i) biographical information regarding any officers, directors
or shareholders of the resulting bank holding company who were 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 senior officers or directors of the bank prior to the reorganization, and (ii) a detailed history of the involvement
of any officer, director or shareholder of the resulting bank holding company in any administrative or criminal proceeding;
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 financial statements for the bank holding company, and a description of the amount, source and terms of debt, if any,
that the bank holding company proposes to incur, and information regarding the sources and timing for debt service
and retirement; and (5) verification that notice of the proposal has been published in a newspaper of general circulation
in the community in which the bank is located that provides an opportunity for interested persons to comment on the
notice for a period of at least 15 calendar days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, the interim rule requires that the applicant publish notice of the proposed reorganization and
invite public comment for a period of at least 15 days. This request for public comment is consistent with the Board's
practice of publishing notice of all bank holding company formations and bank expansion proposals so that the public
may comment in particular on the bank's record of serving the convenience and needs of the community under the Community
Reinvestment Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 7 calendar days of receipt of a notice containing all the information required under this interim regulation,
the appropriate Reserve Bank will provide a written acknowledgement of receipt of the notice indicating that the
transaction may be consummated following the 30th calendar day after the date the notice was received by the Reserve
Bank unless the Reserve Bank or the Board objects to the proposal during that time. The Reserve Bank may provide written
notice of approval of the reorganization at an earlier time during the notice period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If during the notice period the Board or the Reserve Bank objects to the proposal, the bank holding company must file
an application under section 3 of the BHC Act.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In this case, the notificant will immediately be notified of the reason for the objection, and of any additional information
that may be needed to complete an application.

Shortening of Post-Approval Waiting Period Under Section 321 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, section 11(b)(1) of the BHC Act (12 U.S.C. 1849(b)(1)) prohibits a bank holding company that has received
approval for a transaction under section 3 of the BHC Act (other than transactions involving a probable bank failure
or an emergency) from consummating the transaction prior to the thirtieth day following Board approval of the proposal
in order to provide the United States Attorney General time to review the transaction for any adverse effects on competition
in banking or the concentration of banking resources. The Bank Merger Act contains a similar provision applying post-approval
waiting period to bank merger proposals. See 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Section 319 creates an exception from the application and approval process established by section 3 of the
BHC Act, a notificant who has met the criteria of Section 319 and the interim rule does not appear to be subject to the
post-approval waiting period established under section 11 of the BHC Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to other acquisitions under section 3 of the BHC Act or under the Bank Merger Act, section 321 of the Riegle
Act (``Section 321'') authorizes the Board to shorten the post-approval waiting period in any case to a period of not
less than 15 days, provided the Board has received no adverse comment from the Attorney General relating to competitive
factors and the Attorney General concurs with the Board's decision to shorten the waiting period. Section 321 does
not affect processing of applications involving probable bank failures or emergencies. The interim rule incorporates
these revisions to the Board's Regulation Y. The Board is currently discussing with the U.S. Department of Justice
the types of cases that may qualify for this shortened post-approval waiting period, and invites public comment on
the types of cases where this would be appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, the Board has adopted the following interim rule which shall be effective immediately, and invites
public comment on all aspects of this interim rule. The Board also invites suggestions on other means of reducing the
regulatory burden associated with its application and notices procedures.

number of small entities. This interim rule will reduce the regulatory burden imposed by the Board's procedures on
small bank holding companies in formation, and the Board is inviting public comment on additional ways to reduce regulatory
burden.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') is issuing final, non-substantive amendments to its Rule on Deceptive
Advertising as to Sizes of Viewable Pictures Shown by Television Receiving Sets, known as the Picture Tube Rule. The
Commission solicited comments on the Rule as part of the agency's periodic review of rules and guides. Having considered
all of the issues raised during the comment period, the Commission is amending the Rule. These amendments add the metric
equivalents for measurements stated in inches in the examples used in the Rule, and clarify some of the illustrations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Commission has determined, as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review rules and guides periodically.
These reviews seek information about the costs and benefits of the Commission's rules and guides and their regulatory
and economic impact. The information obtained assists the Commission in identifying rules and guides that warrant
modification or recision. On April 19, 1993, the Commission published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a request for public comments on its Trade Regulation Rule on Deceptive Advertising as to Sizes of Viewable Pictures
Shown by Television Receiving Sets, 16 CFR part 410 (``The Picture Tube Rule'' or ``The Rule'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Rule, like the other trade regulation rules issued by the Commission, ``define[s] with specificity acts or practices
which are unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Such rules may include requirements prescribed
for the purpose of preventing such acts or practices. A violation of a rule shall constitute an unfair or deceptive
act or practice in violation of section 5(a)(1) of (the Federal Trade Commission Act), unless the Commission otherwise
expressly provides in its rule.'' 16 CFR 1.8. The Commission may initiate a trade regulation rule proceeding ``upon
its own initiative or pursuant to written petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person stating reasonable
grounds therefor,'' 16 CFR 1.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. The Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Picture Tube Rule sets forth the appropriate means for disclosing the method by which the dimensions of television
screens are measured, when the measurement is included in any advertisement or promotional material for the television
set. Under the Rule, the method used to measure the size of a television screen must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed
in close proximity to the size designation. However, the Rule provides a safe harbor for measurements based on the
horizontal dimensions, which may be given without disclosing that the dimensions were measured horizontally. The
Rule notes that the measurement must not take into account any curvature of the tube. Further, disclosing the method
of measurement in a footnote rather than in the body of the ad does not constitute a disclosure in close proximity to
the size designation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Rule includes examples of both proper and improper representations of size descriptions. Previously, these
examples were expressed in terms of inches. Under Executive Order 12770 of July 25, 1991 (56 FR 35801), and the Metric
Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, (15 U.S.C. 205) all federal agencies are
required to use the SI metric system of measurement in all procurements, grants and other business-related activities
(which include rulemakings), except to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies
or loss of markets to United States firms. To comply with these provisions, the examples in the Rule have been altered
to include the metric equivalent in parentheses beside the English measurements. Thus, the measurements in the examples
have been revised to read: 15 inches (38.10 cm); 19 inches (48.26 cm); 20 inches (50.80 cm); 21 inches (53.34 cm); and
262 square inches (1,690.32 sq. cm). This is a technical amendment to an illustrative example in the Rule rather than
a substantive amendment to the Rule. It is not intended to create any new requirement under the Rule to use metric measurements
or to use them in any particular fashion (for example, in hundredths of centimeters). A new note has been added to the
Rule providing that the metric measurements are included for information purposes only, and are not required to be
included in any of the disclosures.

The Commission received five comments, four of which supported retaining the Rule in its current form or with minor
modifications, and one which supported repeal of the Rule. Most of the comments indicated that the Rule continues
to provide a benefit to the industry and consumers, while imposing no significant costs on the industry members.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The one comment opposing the regulation maintained that it imposed an unreasonable burden on the Federal Trade Commission
in administering and enforcing the regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of the comments indicated that the Picture Tube Rule has provided significant benefits to the public
and the consumer electronics industry, and imposed very little costs on entities subject to the Rule's requirements.
One comment noted that the Rule did impose economic costs on television manufacturers in 1966 when the Rule was first
promulgated.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 At that time, manufacturers had to prepare and produce new advertising and promotional materials to comply with the
Rule. Further, the United States was, and is to this day, the only country that requires screen measurements to be limited
to the viewable picture area.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 After the initial modifications, however, the Rule does not appear to have imposed any further burdens on the industry.
One manufacturer noted that the Rule has had ``virtually no cost impact'' on the company.

The Commission is aware of an effort by the Canadian government to adopt similar provisions concerning televisions
advertised for sale in Canada. Further, the Canadian television industry is considering adopting a voluntary standard
that would provide for measurement of only the viewable area.

It appears that the Rule has also provided significant benefits. The comments indicated that by establishing a uniform
system of measurement, the Rule enabled consumers to compare various products from different manufacturers.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 One comment concluded, ``the rule and industry standard have virtually eliminated the possibility of consumer deception
regarding television screen size.''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Rule's uniform system of measurement has also served the consumer electronics industry. A television manufacturer
indicated that the rule has provided a significant benefit to the company and the industry, and created ``a legal framework
in which a standard industry practice of planar, diagonal-dimension measurement of the viewable screen area has
emerged.''
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 After reviewing these comments, the Commission believes the Rule has provided a clear public benefit, as well as a
service to the industry, while imposing minimal costs on the industry.

2. Is There A Continuing Need for This Rule?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Just as the comments generally maintain that the Rule has provided significant benefits, most of the comments also
support retaining the Rule. A trade association maintained that the Rule is still needed to ensure the consistency
in screen measurements that is relied upon by both consumers and industry members.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 One manufacturer expressed concern that if the Federal Trade Commission repealed the Rule, then other manufacturers
would return to using deceptive measurements in their advertisements.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Based upon these comments, the Commission finds that there is a continuing need for the Picture Tube Rule.

3. What Burdens Does Adherence With This Rule Place on Entities Subject to Its Requirements?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, while the Picture Tube may have imposed a burden on advertisers and manufacturers when it was first
promulgated, it appears that the Rule does not impose any current significant burden on any entities subject to the
Rule. A trade association noted that the industry has incorporated the regulation's requirements into common business
practice, and thus, the Rule is no longer a burden on industry members.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 A manufacturer also indicated that the Rule ``places virtually no burden whatsoever on entities subject to it.''
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 One comment, however, suggested that the Rule did impose a burden on the Federal Trade Commission through administration
and enforcement of the Rule.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission has found that enforcing the Rule has entailed relatively little administrative burden on the agency,
given the industry's general compliance with the Rule. Further, in seeking public comment, the Commission was soliciting
information concerning the burden on other entities rather than the agency itself.

4. What Changes Should Be Made to This Rule to Minimize the Economic Effect on Such Entities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although most of the comments supported preserving the Picture Tube Rule, a few comments from industry members suggested
changes to the Rule. The Electronic Industries Association urged the Commission to eliminate the horizontal dimension
as the default measurement.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Currently, the advertised dimensions must reflect the horizontal measurement unless the alternative method of
measurement is clearly and conspicuously disclosed in close proximity to the size designation. According to the
Association, however, the prevailing practice within the industry is to use the diagonal plane to measure the screen,
and this is the measurement that is most familiar to consumers. Thus, the comment urges the Commission to amend the
Rule to reflect current industry practice. A manufacturer, however, recommended that the Commission retain the
existing provision concerning the disclosure of the method of measurement, suggesting that methods of measuring
picture tubes are still not likely to be instinctively understood by consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the Commission initially promulgated the Picture Tube Rule in 1966, most television manufacturers measured
the dimensions of their sets diagonally, just as they do today. Thus, the horizontal dimension was not chosen to be
the default setting based on a belief that it was the industry norm. Rather, the Commission found that almost all rectangular
objects, such as blankets and rugs, were measured horizontally and vertically. Television screens were the only
rectangular-shaped commodities that were measured diagonally. Thus, the Commission reasoned, if a rectangular
screen was measured in the usual manner for similarly-shaped objects, then no disclosure of the method of measurement
was necessary.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, the television industry has adopted the Rule's disclosure requirements as part of its routine business
practice. Reversing the provision, to require a disclosure when a measurement other than the diagonal dimension
is used, will provide no tangible benefit, and may cause confusion in the industry and among consumers. Finally, as
one television manufacturer noted in its comment, identifying the method of measurement is useful to consumers because
many would not instinctively understand the diagonal measurement.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the Commission sees no reason to revise the Rule's disclosure requirements at this time.

Another comment suggested amending Note 2 of the Rule to provide that a disclosure in a footnote or asterisk would constitute
a disclosure in ``close connection and conjunction'' to the measurement, as required by the Rule.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 However, footnotes or other fine-print disclosures separated from the body of an advertisement may not be adequate
to qualify statements in the text.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the Commission has declined to amend the Rule to allow the disclosure of the method of measurement in a footnote
or asterisk.

One comment urged the Commission to add an additional Note to the text of the Rule providing that advertisers need not
identify the method of measurement every time an advertisement indicates a television's dimensions, as long as the
method is disclosed in close connection to the most prominent indication of screen size in the given advertisement.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission does not believe there is a sufficient basis to justify this amendment. Many advertisements for televisions
promote multiple television sets of different sizes, and a single disclosure of the method of measurement may not
be noticed by consumers. The commenter provided no evidence that multiple disclosures were burdensome. Under the
Rule, advertisers can comply simply by stating ``X inches'' for picture tubes measured horizontally, or ``X inches
diagonal'' for diagonal measurements. Further, almost all of the comments the Commission received indicated that
the current provisions of the Picture Tube Rule are not a burden to manufacturers or advertisers. Thus, the Commission
has decided not to adopt the proposed Note, or otherwise provide exceptions to the requirement that the method of measurement
accompany each measurement other than a horizontal description.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1972, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission issued an opinion letter to the Consumer Electronics Group of the
Electronic Industries Association concerning various methods of disclosing the method of measurement used for
television screens.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 In the letter, staff approved a number of proposed disclosures, including ``20 inch diagonal.'' One comment maintained
that the staff opinion letter approving the use ``20 inch diagonal'' is inconsistent with the Rule listing the disclosure
``21 inch diagonal set'' as inappropriate.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 The examples in the Rule apply to a television screen measuring 19 inches horizontally, 15 inches vertically, and
20 inches diagonally. Thus, the example states that the disclosure ``21 inch diagonal set'' is inappropriate not
because of the description of the method of measurement, but because the 21 inch measurement is not accurate for the
set used in the example. The disclosure approved in the opinion letter used the correct 20 inch measurement. While
the current Rule would permit ``20 inch diagonal,'' that phrase is not included in the list of permitted disclosures.
While this list is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, the Commission has decided to include this
disclosure in the examples provided to remove any uncertainly that may exist.

One comment suggested adding language to the text of the Rule that introduces the examples of improper disclosures
to provide that these examples are only improper absent disclosures elsewhere in the advertisement that clearly
indicate the method of measurement utilized to obtain the given dimensions.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission would be concerned that combining improper and proper disclosures in the same advertisement could
engender consumer confusion or deception. Thus, the Commission has determined not to amend the Rule as suggested

One of the examples identified in the Rule as being unacceptable is ``21 inch over-all diagonal_262 square inch picture.''
One comment suggested deleting the second half of the example that refers to square inch measurements, so as to permit
such measurements for wide-screen televisions.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 While the Commission has no information on the likelihood of manufacturers of wide-screen televisions using square
inch dimensions rather than the more traditional forms of measurement, the Rule does not prohibit measurements based
on square inches. Rather, the example cited above is intended only to convey that the term, ``overall'' is inappropriate,
regardless of whether it is accompanied by the square inch dimensions of the viewable picture screen. To avoid confusion
and to emphasize the phrase that causes concern, the Commission has determined to modify the example ``21 inch over-all
diagonal_262 square inch picture'' in the list of unacceptable disclosures to read ``21 inch over-all diagonal.''

6. Have Technology or Economic Conditions Changed Since This Rule Was Issued, and, If So, What Effect Do These Changes
Have on the Rule?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Picture Tube Rule was first promulgated in 1966. Since then, both technology and economic conditions have changed
significantly. A much greater percentage of households owns one or more televisions. Television sets have become
more complex and offer an array of features. The television industry itself has expanded considerably, with the advent
of cable and satellite television, and the introduction of interactive television combined with personal computers
and telecommunications. However, none of these changes require any modification of the Picture Tube Rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technological change with the closest nexus to the Picture Tube Rule is the introduction of high definition television
(HDTV), and the new, wider screens used to display these enhanced digital pictures. Most television screens today
have horizontal/vertical dimensions in a 5:3 proportion, or aspect ratio, but the screens for the HDTV have a 16:9
aspect ratio.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 The new ratio, however, does not necessitate any changes to the Rule, because the existing provisions can easily be
applied to the new screens. HDTVs may be advertised as ``46 inch diagonal'' sets. Most consumers are familiar with
this type of measurement for televisions, and will be able to use this measurement to compare different brands of HDTVs,
as well as between high definition and more traditional screens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
TV Digest
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a trade industry publication, has suggested adding a ``W'' (for wide-screen) to the diagonal measure of the new 16:9
television screens.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Nothing in the existing Rule would prohibit this designation. However, the Commission does not believe the designation
is necessary to avoid consumer deception or confusion because the ``46 inch diagonal'' or any other measurement allowed
under the Rule should provide consumers with adequate information as to the size of the HDTV. Consequently, no additional
designation such as ``W'' is required under the Rule for wide-screen televisions.

 Currently, the Rule is limited to ``television receiving sets'' and does not encompass computer monitors. The Commission
is considering measurement problems with regard to computer monitors, but has determined not to initiate a rulemaking
proceeding to amend the Picture Tube Rule at this time. Rather, the Commission is reviewing the extent of problems
in this area, and is exploring other possible options for addressing such problems.

 The Securities and Exchange Commission adopts an amendment to Rule 3a12&hyph;8 [17 CFR 240.3a12&hyph;8] under the

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), it is unlawful to trade a futures contract on any individual security,
unless the security in question is an exempted security (other than a municipal security) for the purposes of the Securities
Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Debt obligations of foreign governments are not exempted securities under either of these statutes. The Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), however, has the authority to designate securities as exempted
securities for purposes of the Exchange Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``exempted security'' is defined in Section 3 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77c, and Section 3(a)(12) of
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on debt securities of certain foreign governments by U.S.
persons, the Commission has adopted Rule 3a12&hyph;8 under the Exchange Act (``Rule'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to designate debt obligations issued by certain foreign governments as exempted securities under the Exchange Act
solely for the purpose of marketing and trading futures contracts on those securities in the United States or to U.S.
persons.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, the foreign governments listed in the Rule are Great Britain, Canada, Japan, Australia, France, New Zealand,
Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, and Italy (the ``fourteen designated
countries''). As a result, futures contracts on the debt obligations of these countries may be sold to U.S. persons,
so long as the other terms of the Rule are satisfied.

The Commission is adopting this amendment to the Rule, adding Spain to the list of countries whose debt obligations
are exempted by Rule 3a12&hyph;8. In order to qualify for the exemption, futures contracts on debt obligations of
Spain would have to meet all the other existing requirements of the Rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 These sections of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act explicitly designate certain securities, including government
securities and municipal securities, as exempted securities. Securities issued by foreign governments, however,
are not ``government securities'' within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, securities issued by foreign governments are not deemed to be exempted securities under the statutory
language.

 As originally adopted, the Rule provided that debt obligations of Canada and the United Kingdom would be deemed to
be exempted securities, solely for the purpose of permitting the offer, sale, and confirmation of ``qualifying foreign
futures contracts'' on such securities, so long as the securities in question were neither registered under the Securities
Act nor the subject of any American Depositary Receipt so registered. A futures contract on such a debt obligation
is deemed under the Rule to be a ``qualifying foreign futures contract'' if delivery under the contract is settled
outside the United States and is traded on a board of trade.

The marketing and trading of foreign futures contracts to U.S. persons is subject to regulation by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission (``CFTC''). In particular, Section 4b of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 6b, authorizes the CFTC to regulate
the offer and sale of foreign futures contracts to U.S. persons, and Rule 9, 17 CFR 30.9, promulgated under Section
2(a)(1)(A) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(1)(A), is intended to prohibit fraud in connection with the offer and sale to U.S.
persons of futures contracts executed on foreign exchanges. Additional rules promulgated under Section 2(a)(1)(A)
of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 2(1)(A), govern the domestic offer and sale of futures and options contracts traded on foreign
boards of trade. These rules require, among other things, that the domestic offer and sale of foreign futures be effected
through CFTC registrants or through entities subject to a foreign regulatory framework comparable to that governing
domestic futures trading.

17 CFR 30.3, 30.4, and 30.5 (1991). In enacting the Futures Trading Act of 1982, Congress expressed its understanding
that neither the SEC nor the CFTC had intended to bar the sale of futures contracts on debt obligations of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (``United Kingdom'') to U.S. persons, and its expectation that administrative
action would be taken to allow the sale of such futures contracts in the United States.

The conditions imposed by the Rule were intended to facilitate the trading of futures contracts on foreign government
securities without sacrificing the longstanding policy under the federal securities laws of requiring foreign
government securities to comply with the basic requirements of the federal securities laws in order to be marketed
and traded in the United States. Accordingly, the conditions set forth in the Rule were designed to ensure that, absent
registration, a domestic market in unregistered foreign government securities would not develop, and that markets
for futures on these instruments would not be used to avoid the registration requirements and other provisions of
the federal securities laws.

Letter from Wesley G. Nissen, Katten Muchin &amp; Zavis, to William H. Heyman, Director, Division of Market Regulation,
Commission, dated January 14, 1993. Subsequent to the LIFFE request, the Commission published a proposal to amend
Rule 3a12&hyph;8 to include Spanish sovereign debt. Shortly thereafter, LIFFE ceased to trade futures on Spanish
debt. Recently, the Commission has been apprised of continuing interest by market participants in the proposed amendment
to Rule 3a12&hyph;8 because of the trading on the MEFF of futures on Spanish government debt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is amending Rule 3a12&hyph;8 to add Spain to the list of countries whose debt obligations are deemed
to be ``exempted securities'' under the terms of the Rule. Under this amendment, the existing conditions set forth
in the Rule (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the underlying securities not be registered in the United States, that the futures contracts require delivery
outside the United States, and that the contracts be traded on a board of trade) would continue to apply. This should
ensure that a domestic market in the unregistered foreign sovereign debt of Spain does not develop. Therefore, the
amendment should pose no risk for investors in the U.S. securities market.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first letter objected to the rating of Aa2 by Moody's Investors Service (``Moody's'') and AA by Standard and Poor's
(``S&amp;P''), stating that such debt obligations should receive the same rating as two public Spanish companies:
Red Nacional de Ferrocarriles Espanoles (``RENFE'') and Instituto Nacional de Industria (``INI'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The letter also voiced concerns about the possible effects the rule proposal might have on Spain's debt management
and policies, and requested further time to study such effects.

For the reasons discussed below, and in light of the comment letters received, the Commission has determined that
Rule 3a12&hyph;8 should be amended to include the debt obligations of Spain. The Commission believes that the debt
obligations of Spain should be subject to the same regulatory treatment under the Rule as those of the fourteen designated
countries for purposes of trading futures contracts on such debt obligations by U.S. persons. Like the debt obligations
of the fourteen designated countries,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the long-term debt obligations of Spain are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least two nationally
recognized statistical rating organizations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of the Rule, the Commission is aware of no material differences between the debt obligations of Spain
and those of the fourteen designated countries. Although the commenter believed the assigned rating for Spain's
debt obligations should be in the highest rating category, that issue is not relevant to the Commission's determination
to amend the Rule.

In amending the Rule to exempt the debt securities of other countries, the Commission has noted that the long-term

Additionally, the Commission believes that there are no valid legal or policy reasons for denying U.S. investors
the ability to trade futures on debt obligations of Spain. Moreover, the availability to U.S. investors of these hedging
vehicles will allow such investors to take advantage of the growing globalization of the securities markets.

V. Effects on Competition and Other Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requires the Commission, in adopting rules under the Exchange Act, to consider the competitive effects of such rules,
if any, and to balance any impact with the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the Exchange
Act. The Commission has considered the amendments to the Rule in light of the standards cited in Section 23(a)(2) and
believes that adoption of the amendments will not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. As stated above, the amendment is designed to assure the lawful availability
in this country of Spanish government bond futures that otherwise would not be permitted to be marketed under the terms
of the CEA. The amendment thus serves to expand the range of financial products available in the United States and enhances
competition in financial markets. Insofar as the Rule contains limitations, they are designed to promote the purposes
of the Exchange Act by ensuring that futures trading on Spanish government securities is consistent with the goals
and purposes of the federal securities laws by minimizing the impact of the Rule on securities trading and distribution
in the United States.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 8, 1987, the Commission issued its final rule amending Part 11 of its regulations (Order No. 469, 52 FR 18201,
May 14, 1987). The final rule revised the billing procedures for annual charges for administering Part I of the Federal
Power Act, the billing procedures for charges for Federal dam and land use, and the methodology for assessing Federal
land use charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Commission's regulations, the Commission by its designee, the Executive Director, is updating
its schedule of fees for the use of government lands. The yearly update is determined by adapting the most recent schedule
of fees for the use of linear rights-of-way prepared by the United States Forest Service. Since the next fiscal year
will cover the period from October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1995, the fees in this notice will become effective
October 1, 1994. The fees will apply to fiscal year 1995 annual charges for the use of government lands.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document amends the Customs Regulations to reflect the extension of the import restrictions on Maya artifacts
from the Peten Region, Guatemala which were imposed by T.D. 91&hyph;34. The Deputy Director of the United States Information
Agency has determined that the emergency conditions which originally warranted the imposition of import restrictions
still exist. Accordingly, the restrictions will continue to be in effect for an additional three years, and the Customs
Regulations are being amended to indicate this extension.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act, the Deputy Director of the
United States Information Agency (USIA), after consultation with the Secretaries of State and Treasury, determined
that Maya artifacts from the Peten Region, Guatemala were in danger of pillage and looting, and that an emergency condition
existed which warranted the imposition of a prohibition on the importation of such articles into the United States.
In T.D. 91&hyph;34, the Customs Service announced the imposition of import restrictions and identified the types
of articles covered by the restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Director of the USIA has considered the recommendations of the Cultural Property Advisory Committee and
determined that the emergency conditions which warranted imposition of the initial restrictions still exist and
has decided to extend the import restrictions for another three years. (See 59 FR 50038, September 30, 1994.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Customs is amending &sect;12.104g (19 CFR 12.104g) to reflect the extension of the import restriction.

Inapplicability of Notice and Delayed Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this amendment reflects the extension of emergency import restrictions on cultural property which is currently
subject to pillage and looting, pursuant to &sect;553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, no notice of proposed
rulemaking or public procedure is necessary. For the same reason, a delayed effective date is both impracticable
and contrary to the public interest.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission amends its regulations designating certain State and local fair employment
practices agencies as certified designated agencies. The designation permits the Commission to accept the findings
and resolutions of State and local fair employment practices agencies in regard to most cases processed under contract
without individual, case-by-case substantial weight reviews by the Commission. Publication of this amendment
effectuates the designation of the Arlington County (VA) Human Rights Commission as a certified designated FEP agency.

submitted pesticide petition PP 0F3893 to EPA requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(d) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d), establish a tolerance for combined residues of the

-(methoxyacetyl)-alanine methylester, each expressed as metalaxyl, in or on the raw agricultural commodity leafy
vegetables (except Brassica) group (except spinach) at 5.0 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
By way of public reminder, this notice also reiterates the registrant's responsibility under section 6 (a)(2) of
FIFRA to submit additional factual information regarding adverse effects on the environment and to human health
by the pesticide. The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated.
The toxicological data considered in support of the tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A 3-month dietary study in rats with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) at 17.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
body weight (bwt)/day (250 parts per million (ppm)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A developmental toxicity study in rats with a NOEL of 50 mg/kg bwt for developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits with a NOEL of 300 mg/kg bwt, the highest dose tested (HDT). Metalaxyl
did not cause developmental toxicity, even in the presence of maternal toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Metalaxyl was negative in bacterial and mammalian gene mutation. The fungicide also did not increase the frequency
of reverse mutations in yeast. Metalaxyl was negative in an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cytogenetics assay (hamsters) and a dominant-lethal assay (mice). Metalaxyl did not increase unscheduled DNA synthesis
in rat primary hepatocytes or in human fibroblasts. These results suggest that metalaxyl is not genotoxic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 63 mg/kg bwt/day (1,250 ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A 6-month dog feeding study with a NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). Effects found at 25 mg/kg were increased serum
alkaline phosphatase activity and increased liver weight and liver-to-brain weight ratios without histological
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the
conditions of the study at dietary levels up to 1,250 ppm. The NOEL is 13 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). The lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) is 63 mg/kg/day based upon slight increases in liver weight to body weight ratios and periacinar vacuolation
of hepatocytes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A 2-year mouse oncogenic study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study
at dietary levels up to 190 mg/kg/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of concerns raised over some equivocal increases in tumor incidences in the male mouse liver and the male rat
adrenal medulla, and the female rat thyroid, the two chronic feeding studies were submitted to the Environmental
Pathology Laboratories (EPL) for an independent reading of the microscopic slides. The new pathological evaluation
by EPL and the original reports of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies were then both submitted for review to EPA's
Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG). A final review of the carcinogenicity studies and related material was performed
by the Peer Review Committee of the Toxicology Branch (TB) of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four major issues evaluated by CAG and the peer review group included: (1) Perifollicular cell adenomas in the
thyroid of female rats; (2) adrenal medullary tumors (pheochromocytomas) in male rats; (3) liver tumors in male mice;
and (4) whether the HDT (1,250 ppm) in the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies represented a maximum-tolerated dose
(MTD).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the thyroid tumors in female rats, the peer review group concluded that the increased incidences of thyroid
tumors in females of treated groups were not compound related. This conclusion was based on the following: (1) There
was no progression of benign tumors (adenomas) to malignancy (carcinomas); (2) there was no increase in hyperplastic
changes; (3) there was no dose-response relationship; and (4) the two reevaluations of the microscopic slides by
the pathologists at EPL and TB in OPP further did not confirm any apparent effects observed in the original report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of a possible treatment-related increase of adrenal medullary gland tumors, namely, pheochromocytomas,
in the male rat was also reassessed by both CAG and the Peer Review Committee. Both concluded that the data, especially
in view of the reevaluation of the microscopic slides performed by EPL, did not support a compound-related increase
of adrenal medullary tumors; the incidence of pheochromocytomas more accurately represented spontaneous variations
of a commonly occurring tumor in the aged rat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis of the significance of the equivocal increase in the incidence of liver tumors in male mice was very similar
to that performed for the rat thyroid and adrenal gland tumors. The original pathological reading of the tissue slides
reported an elevated increase of tumors in some treatment groups; however, these increases were not evident after
a reevaluation of the microscopic slides was performed by an independent pathologist at EPL and by the reading of a
CAG pathologist. The Peer Review Committee concurred that the reevaluation of the slides is reliable and does not
show any compound-related increase in the incidence of liver tumors in the mouse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the data from the rat and mouse long-term studies are sufficient to support the conclusion
that metalaxyl does not show a carcinogenic potential in laboratory animals. This conclusion is supported by the
following: (1) The doses tested in both the rat and mouse long-term studies approached an MTD based upon compound-related
changes in liver weight and/or liver histology; (2) extensive available mutagenic evidence indicates no potential
genotoxic activity which correlates with the negative carcinogenic potential demonstrated in long-term testing;
(3) metalaxyl is not structurally related to known carcinogens; and (4) under the conditions of the rat and mouse tests,
no indication of compound-related carcinogenic effects was noted at any of the treatment doses, sexes, or species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The chronic dietary exposure analysis used a reference dose (RfD) of 0.08 mg/kg bwt/day, based on a NOEL of 7.8 mg/kg
bwt/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is taken from a 6-month dog feeding study which demonstrated increased
alkaline phosphatase activity and an increase in relative liver weights at 30.63 mg/kg bwt/day. The RfD was taken
from actual dose values and has thus changed from 0.06 mg/kg bwt/day to the 0.08 used in the analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food uses evaluated in the residue analysis were the published uses of metalaxyl listed in 40 CFR 180.408 and 185.4000
and the proposed use on leafy vegetables (except Brassica) group (except spinach). In a memo of June 21, 1991, Chemistry
Branch Tolerance Support recommended for a tolerance reassessment for metalaxyl on leafy vegetables (except Brassica)
group (except spinach). In 40 CFR 180.408 tolerances exist for metalaxyl on leafy vegetables (0.1 ppm), spinach (10
ppm), and head lettuce (5 ppm). Data submitted lead to the proposed new tolerance of 5 ppm for the crop group leafy vegetables
(except Brassica) group (except spinach) for metalaxyl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (GLC and AFID) are available
for enforcement purposes in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A chronic exposure analysis was performed using tolerance level residues and 100-percent-crop-treated information
to estimate the Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population and 22 subgroups. Percent-crop-treated
data were used to calculate the Anticipated Residue Contribution (ARC) for the Dietary Risk Evaluation System (DRES)
population subgroups for certain commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticipated residue contribution (ARC) for the overall U. S. population from published uses is 6.5 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day, which represents 8% of the RfD. The proposed use on leafy vegetables (except Brassica) group (except
spinach) contributes an exposure of 4.7 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day, representing less than 1% of the RfD. When the proposed exposure is added to the public exposure for
metalaxyl the ARC is 6.9 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day, or 9% of the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subgroup most highly exposed, children (1 to 6 years old), has an ARC from existing uses of 1.2 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 16% of the RfD. The proposed use contributes an additional 6.1 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day and raises the overall ARC 1.3 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day, still representing 16% of the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the exposure and risk estimates arrived at through this analysis, the Agency believes that the proposed use
for metalaxyl does not pose a chronic dietary risk that is of concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerance established by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal
Register, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections
and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections
and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The
objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the
objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 EPA issued a notice, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 9, 1990 (55 FR 779), which announced that the Rohm &amp; Haas Co. of Independence Mall West, Philadelphia,
PA 19105, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 9F3811 to EPA proposing to establish tolerances under section 408
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) for the fungicide myclobutanil (

cherry at 5.0 ppm. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequently, Rohm &amp; Haas amended the petition by deleting the request for the stone fruit group and requesting
tolerances for peaches and nectarines at 2.0 ppm and cherries (sweet and sour) at 5.0 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Agency requested that Rohm &amp; Haas amend the petition by proposing a tolerance of 4.0 ppm in/on
cherries. The petition was amended by requesting that the tolerance for cherries be reduced to 4.0 ppm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 5, 1992 (57 FR 4368), EPA established tolerances, on an interim basis, in 40 CFR 180.443 for residues of
this chemical in or on the raw agricultural commodities cherries (sweet and sour), nectarines, and peaches. An expiration
date of October 1, 1994, was imposed for the tolerances. The interim tolerances were established based upon the condition
that data be submitted to the Agency to fully support permanent tolerances for these commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conditions imposed by the establishment of the interim tolerances were that the chronic/oncogenicity feeding
studies in the mouse and the rat be repeated. Both studies need to be repeated because a maximum-tolerated dose (MTD)
had not been achieved. However, no preneoplastic lesions were observed in either study to suggest possible carcinogenic
activity, and myclobutanil did not induce either genotoxic effects or chromosomal aberrations in a series of mutagenicity
tests. In addition, no strong structural activity correlation to other carcinogens has been found. Under these circumstances,
EPA concluded that no significant carcinogenic risk was posed by these tolerances for the timeframe involved in receiving
and reviewing the repeated studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency evaluated dietary exposure to the fungicide residues for the commodities which have established permanent
or interim tolerances. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the 2-year rat chronic feeding study (NOEL of 2.49
mg/kg body weight/ day), using a hundredfold uncertainty factor, was calculated to be 0.025 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical
maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from previously established tolerances and interim tolerances is 0.002217
mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 8.865 percent of the ADI.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in support of the tolerances and other relevant material have been reviewed. The toxicological
data considered in support of these tolerances are discussed in detail in the document establishing the interim tolerances
which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 5, 1992 (57 FR 4369).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the above dietary risk estimate, the Agency believes that an extension of the interim tolerances would
not pose a significant public health risk for the period of time indicated and would allow the Agency sufficient time
to review the final reports on all the required data. EPA does not expect that the required data will significantly
change the above risk estimate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the available studies on myclobutanil, the Agency has concluded that the human risk posed by the use
of myclobutanil on cherries, nectarines, and peaches does not raise significant concerns. The Agency has determined
that extending the tolerances will protect the human health. Therefore, as set forth below, the tolerances are extended
to April 1, 1995. Based upon the reviews of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies, the Agency will determine whether
establishing permanent tolerances is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residues remaining in or on the above raw agricultural commodities after expiration of these tolerances will not
be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term, and in accordance with, provisions
of the conditional registrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the

, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections and hearing
requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or
hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections
submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections
(40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested,
the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions
on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will
be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is genuine and
substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor
would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested
claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issues(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would
be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing.
By way of public reminder, this notice also reiterates the registrant's responsibility under section 6 (a)(2) of
FIFRA to submit additional factual information regarding adverse effects on the environment and to human health
by the pesticide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scientific data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological
data considered in support of the tolerances include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A 3-month dietary study in rats with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) at 17.5 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)
body weight (bwt)/day (250 parts per million (ppm)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A developmental toxicity study in rats with a NOEL of 50 mg/kg bwt for developmental toxicity and maternal toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A developmental toxicity study in rabbits with a NOEL of 300 mg/kg bwt, the highest dose tested (HDT). Metalaxyl
did not cause developmental toxicity, even in the presence of maternal toxicity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Metalaxyl was negative in bacterial and mammalian gene mutation. The fungicide also did not increase the frequency
of reverse mutations in yeast. Metalaxyl was negative in an in vivo cytogenetics assay (hamsters) and a dominant-lethal
assay (mice). Metalaxyl did not increase unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes or in human fibroblasts.
These results suggest that metalaxyl is not genotoxic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A three-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 63 mg/kg bwt/day (1,250 ppm).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A 6-month dog feeding study with a NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). Effects found at 25 mg/kg were increased serum
alkaline phosphatase activity and increased liver weight and liver-to-brain weight ratios without histological
changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A 2-year rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the
conditions of the study at dietary levels up to 1,250 ppm. The NOEL is 13 mg/kg bwt/day (250 ppm). The lowest-observed-effect
level (LOEL) is 63 mg/kg/day based upon slight increases in liver weight to body weight ratios and periacinar vacuolation
of hepatocytes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A 2-year mouse oncogenic study with no compound-related carcinogenic effects under the conditions of the study
at dietary levels up to 190 mg/kg/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of concerns raised over some equivocal increases in tumor incidences in the male mouse liver and the male rat
adrenal medulla, and the female rat thyroid, the two chronic feeding studies were submitted to the Environmental
Pathology Laboratories (EPL) for an independent reading of the microscopic slides. The new pathological evaluation
by EPL and the original reports of the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies were then both submitted for review to EPA's
Carcinogen Assessment Group (CAG). A final review of the carcinogenicity studies and related material was performed
by the Peer Review Committee of the Toxicology Branch (TB) of the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The four major issues evaluated by CAG and the peer review group included: (1) Perifollicular cell adenomas in the
thyroid of female rats; (2) adrenal medullary tumors (pheochromocytomas) in male rats; (3) liver tumors in male mice;
and (4) whether the HDT (1,250 ppm) in the rat and mouse oncogenicity studies represented a maximum-tolerated dose
(MTD).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the thyroid tumors in female rats, the peer review group concluded that the increased incidences of thyroid
tumors in females of treated groups were not compound related. This conclusion was based on the following: (1) There
was no progression of benign tumors (adenomas) to malignancy (carcinomas); (2) there was no increase in hyperplastic
changes; (3) there was no dose-response relationship; and (4) the two reevaluations of the microscopic slides by
the pathologists at EPL and TB in OPP further did not confirm any apparent effects observed in the original report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of a possible treatment-related increase of adrenal medullary gland tumors, namely, pheochromocytomas,
in the male rat was also reassessed by both CAG and the Peer Review Committee. Both concluded that the data, especially
in view of the reevaluation of the microscopic slides performed by EPL, did not support a compound-related increase
of adrenal medullary tumors; the incidence of pheochromocytomas more accurately represented spontaneous variations
of a commonly occurring tumor in the aged rat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis of the significance of the equivocal increase in the incidence of liver tumors in male mice was very similar
to that performed for the rat thyroid and adrenal gland tumors. The original pathological reading of the tissue slides
reported an elevated increase of tumors in some treatment groups; however, these increases were not evident after
a reevaluation of the microscopic slides was performed by an independent pathologist at EPL and by the reading of a
CAG pathologist. The Peer Review Committee concurred that the reevaluation of the slides is reliable and does not
show any compound-related increase in the incidence of liver tumors in the mouse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the data from the rat and mouse long-term studies are sufficient to support the conclusion
that metalaxyl does not show a carcinogenic potential in laboratory animals. This conclusion is supported by the
following: (1) The doses tested in both the rat and mouse long-term studies approached an MTD based upon compound-related
changes in liver weight and/or liver histology; (2) extensive available mutagenic evidence indicates no potential
genotoxic activity which correlates with the negative carcinogenic potential demonstrated in long-term testing;
(3) metalaxyl is not structurally related to known carcinogens; and (4) under the conditions of the rat and mouse tests,
no indication of compound-related carcinogenic effects was noted at any of the treatment doses, sexes, or species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reference dose (RfD) based on the 6-month dog feeding study (NOEL 7.8 mg/kg bwt/day), and using a hundredfold safety
factor, is calculated to be 0.08 mg/kg bwt/day. The anticipated residue contribution from previously established
tolerances and food additive regulations and the tolerances and food additive regulations established here are
0.006465 mg/kg bwt/day and utilize 8% of the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticipated residue contribution from previously established tolerances and food additive regulations and
the tolerances and food additive regulations established here for the subgroup most highly exposed, children (1
to 6 years old), have an anticipated residue contribution (ARC) from existing uses of 1.2 x 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
-2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mg/kg bwt/day, representing 16% of the RfD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residue is adequately understood, and adequate analytical methods (N/P GLC) are available for enforcement
purposes in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are presently no actions pending against the continued registration of this chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency has determined that the tolerances established by amending
40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal
Register, file written objections to the regulation and may also request a hearing on those objections. Objections
and hearing requests must be filed with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections
and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The
objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the
objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing
is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the
requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27).
A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following:
There is genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified
by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account
uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor
would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant''
as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely
and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2)
creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38149), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that the Asgrow Seed Co., Kalamazoo, MI 49004,
had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4310 to EPA under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
21 U.S.C. 346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the plant-pesticides watermelon mosaic
virus-2 coat protein and zucchini yellow mosaic virus coat protein as expressed in Asgrow line ZW20 of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Cucurbita pepo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 L., and subsequent generations obtained through normal sexual reproduction. An amendment to this petition was received
on April 4, 1994, which changed the proposed exemption by including the genetic material necessary for the production
of these proteins.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.
By way of public reminder, this notice also reiterates the registrant's responsibility, under section 6 (a)(2) of
FIFRA, to submit additional factual information regarding adverse effects on the environment and to human health
by the pesticide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted on the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule.
Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the
public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 of August 31, 1994 (59 FR 44956), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that International Specialty Products,
1361 Alps Rd., Wayne, NJ 07470, had submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4308 to EPA requesting that the Administrator,
pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), propose to amend
40 CFR 180.1001(c) by revising the currently listed exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (CAS Reg. No. 9003-39-8) when used as an inert ingredient (surfactant, related adjuvants
of surfactant) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest
to include poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers of molecular weights greater than 4,000. The current molecular weight
limit is 40,000 or over. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed
rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 2, 1983 (48 FR 50532), carcinogenic effects were noted in the rat chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study.
In this study, Charles River CD rats were dosed with aluminum tris (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-ethylphosphonate) at levels of 0, 2,000, 8,000, and 40,000/30,000 ppm (0, 100, 400, and 2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day).
The 40,000-ppm dose was reduced to 30,000 ppm after 2 weeks following observations of staining of the abdominal fur
and red coloration of the urine at 40,000 ppm (2,000 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The highest dose level of the chemical tested in the male Charles River CD-1 rats (2,000/1,500 mg/kg bwt/day) in this
study appears to approximate a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on the finding of urinary bladder hyperplasia at
this dose. Similarly, an MTD level appeared to be satisfied in the female Charles River CD-1 rats at the high-dose level
of 2,000 mg/kg bwt/day, during the first 2 weeks of the carcinogenicity/chronic feeding study, before the dose level
was reduced to 1,500 mg/kg bwt/day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study demonstrated a significantly elevated incidence of urinary bladder tumors (adenomas and carcinomas combined)
at the highest dose level tested (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in male Charles River CD-1 rats. The tumors were mainly seen in
surviving males at the time of terminal sacrifice. The original pathological diagnosis of these tumors was independently
confirmed by another consulting pathologist, who also reported an elevated incidence of urinary bladder hyperplasia
in high-dose male rats. No increase in the incidence of urinary bladder tumors was observed in female rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1986, the Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity of the Office of Pesticide Programs
concluded that the available data provided limited evidence of the carcinogenicity of fosetyl-Al in male rats and
classified the pesticide as a Category C carcinogen (possible human carcinogen with limited evidence of carcinogenicity
in animals) in accordance with proposed Agency guidelines, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 23, 1984 (49 FR 46294). The Health Effects Division Peer Review Committee for Carcinogenicity determined
that a quantitative risk assessment was not appropriate for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The carcinogenic response observed with this chemical was confined solely to the high-dose males at one site (urinary
bladder) in rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The tumor response was primarily due to an increase in benign tumors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The tumors were seen only in surviving animals at the time of terminal sacrifice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The carcinogenic effects were observed only at unusually high doses which exceed the commonly used limit dose of
1,000 mg/kg/day recommended as an upper-limiting dose for bioassays.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The chemical was not carcinogenic when administered in the diet to Charles River CD-1 mice at dose levels ranging
from 2,500 to 30,000 ppm (357 to 4,286 mg/kg bwt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fosetyl-Al was not mutagenic in eight well conducted genotoxic assays. In 1993, the Health Effects Division Peer
Review Committee (PRC) for Carcinogenicity revisited the carcinogenicity classification of fosetyl-Al because
of a recent 90-day feeding study of fosetyl-Al in rats which showed a strong association between the presence of uroliths
in the urinary bladder and the incidence of urinary bladder tumors in treated rats. The PRC concluded that fosetyl-Al
is not amenable to classification using the current Agency cancer guidelines. Based on a mechanistic evaluation
of the only tumors seen, those that occurred at exceptionally high doses (2,000/1,500 mg/kg) in the bladder of male
rats, it appears that humans are not likely to be exposed to doses of fosetyl-Al that produce the urinary tract toxicity
that precedes and seems to lead to the tumor response in rats. In particular, anticipated human dietary and occupational
exposures to fosetyl-Al are far below the NOEL in rats for the apparent urinary tract tumor precursors (stone formation
and attendant epithelial irritation). These effects are produced in rats at extremely high doses, under conditions
not anticipated to occur outside of the experimental laboratory. The PRC concludes that pesticidal use of fosetyl-Al
is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. Therefore, the standard risk assessment approach of using the
Reference Dose (RfD) based on systemic toxicity was applied to fosetyl-Al.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using a 100-fold safety factor and the NOEL of 250 mg/kg bwt/day determined by the most sensitive species from the 2-year
dog-feeding study, the RfD is 3.0 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC) from the established
and proposed tolerances is 0.053921 mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 1.8 percent of the RfD for the overall U. S. population.
For exposure of the most highly exposed subgroup in the population, Non-Hispanic Others, the TMRC is 0.081236 mg/kg
bwt/day and utilizes 2.7 percent of the RfD. Previous tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al, aluminum
tris(O-ethylphosphonate), in asparagus, avocadoes, brassica vegetable crop group, caneberries, citrus, cucurbit
vegetables group, dried hops, dry bulb onions, fresh ginseng root, leafy vegetables crop group, pineapples, pineapple
forage and fodder, and strawberries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolism of aluminum tris(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-ethylphosphonate) in plants is adequately understood. No animal feed items are associated with this petition;
therefore, there is no reasonable expectation of secondary residues occurring in milk, eggs, and meat of livestock
or poultry. There are no processed commodities derived from the RACs, strawberries, brassica vegetable group, and
leafy vegetable group; consequently, no corresponding food or feed additive regulations are required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An adequate analytical method, gas-liquid chromatography, is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the
long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication of the enforcement methodology in the Pesticide
Analytical Manual, Vol. II, the analytical methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested
in pesticide enforcement when requested from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response Program Branch, Field Operations
Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC
20460. Office location and telephone number: Rm. 1128, CM #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Hwy., Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-305-5805.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for which the tolerances are sought. Based on the information
and data considered, the Agency concludes that the establishment of the tolerances will protect the public health.
Therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20).
A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket
for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable
and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fees provided by 40 CFR
180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing
is requested and the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of the evidence relied upon by the objection
(40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted
shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available
evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve on or more of such issues in favor of the requestor,
taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner
sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41430), EPA revoked the feed additive regulation (40 CFR 186.500) for residues of the fungicide
captan in or on corn seed at 100 parts per million (ppm). This regulation addressed corn seed that originally was treated
with captan as a seed protectant and was later ``detreated'' by washing or roasting so that the seed could be used as
an animal feed. The basis for the revocation was the absence of residue data to support the regulation and the lack of
adequate control procedures to ensure seed was detreated properly. On August 27, 1993, Ken Hunt of Ken's Roasting
Service filed objections to that revocation. This Order denies those objections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In March 1986, as part of an overall review of captan, EPA determined that the record contained ``no acceptable residue
data to support the roasting detreatment method at any dosage or period of storage.'' (Guidance for the Reregistration
of Pesticide Products Containing Captan (March 1986).) The Residue Chemistry Chapter of the Registration Standard
(August 1985) concluded that there were insufficient data for residues of captan on corn seed that had been treated
at the maximum label rate and then detreated. The only available data were on residue reduction from washing of treated
corn seed. The then- existing tolerance was exceeded in several samples, the treatments were not conducted at the
maximum label rate, and crucial details of many of the experiments were missing. The validity of the data could not
be determined, and the data covered only a washing process. Data were requested on the residues of concern on seed both
before and after detreating. The detreatment methods of interest to the registrant(s), such as roasting, were to
be tested. This information was essential to establish a proper tolerance and to evaluate the dietary risk from detreated
corn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA announced it would revoke the food additive regulation for detreated corn seed unless within 1 year the following
data and information were submitted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Data on the residues of concern in or on corn seed treated with captan at the maximum allowable rate and detreated
by an acceptable process. Data were required on residues of concern both before and after detreatment. Moreover,
EPA made clear that different methods of detreating would only be permitted under the regulation if data were presented
depicting residues resulting from each method. EPA required that the data must depict the influence of varying parameters
of the detreating process, such as rate of seed treatment, volume of water required, temperature employed, etc. Finally,
EPA explained that these data would be used to establish the acceptable conditions for detreating by each method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An acceptable method for informing corn seed treaters and corn seed distributors of acceptable methods for detreating
captan-treated corn seed must be proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An acceptable handling procedure for captan-treated seed corn (to be detreated) to assure that there are no other
pesticides on the seed must be proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no data or information were submitted over the next 3 years, on August 30, 1989 (54 FR 35897), EPA proposed to
revoke the food additive regulation on the grounds that there were insufficient data to support it. EPA received several
comments opposing the revocation, but none of the commenters submitted the data requested. EPA was not convinced
by any of the comments that the data were not necessary and, therefore, on August 4, 1993, it issued a final rule revoking
the tolerance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 27, 1993, Ken Hunt of Ken's Roasting Service, Arcadia, Nebraska, filed objections to the revocation. Mr.
Hunt supplemented his objections on September 7, 1993. Mr. Hunt's primary objection is that detreatment of captan-treated
seed by roasting is safer than simply disposing of the seed. As support for this contention, Mr. Hunt claims that his
experience in feeding to his livestock seed that he has detreated has caused no harm to the livestock or to his family,
which has consumed meat from that livestock. Mr. Hunt also notes that tolerances for captan on various other crops,
such as grapes, are as high as 50 parts per million (ppm). Mr. Hunt submitted analytic sampling results from his detreated
corn which show that the tested corn contained low levels of captan (2 ppm or less). Mr. Hunt claims that he avoids detreating
seeds that contain pesticide residues other than captan by having his trucker check the labels on all seed that is picked
up for detreatment. Finally, Mr. Hunt asks if EPA would allow him to continue his operation for a few more years because
of the sizable investment he has put into it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons below, EPA must deny Mr. Hunt's objections. Magnitude of residue data, such as were requested here,
are critical data in establishing or supporting tolerances and food additive regulations for pesticide residues.
As EPA's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines explain, ``[r]esidue chemistry data on processed food/feed are used by
the Agency to estimate the exposure of the general population to pesticide residues in foods (including animal commodities)
and for setting and enforcing food additive tolerances for pesticide residues in or on processed food/feed under
provisions of Section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.'' (Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision
O, Addendum 4, p. 2 [MIS #PB88-117270, EPA 540/09-88-004 (Nov. 1987)].)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without magnitude-of-residue data, EPA cannot make accurate exposure estimates and hence risk estimates also will
be inaccurate. The anecdotal information supplied by Mr. Hunt cannot substitute for safety evaluations made on the
basis of valid scientific data. Additionally, magnitude-of-residue data allow EPA to establish enforcement levels
in tolerances and food additive regulations that are representative of the residue levels that will be found under
proper pesticide use patterns. If tolerances and food additive regulations are set at levels exceeding what could
be expected from normal usage, then pesticide users might be encouraged to apply pesticides without strict regard
to label requirements or not to follow proper detreatment procedures. If tolerances and food additive regulations
are set too low, then otherwise safe food may be seized by the Food and Drug Administration or Department of Agriculture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true that several foods have captan tolerances at levels exceeding the levels Mr. Hunt has reported in his detreated
corn, but those tolerances are supported by residue data and the safety of those tolerances has been evaluated based
on those data, consumption pattern data, and information on exposure from other uses of captan. If residue data had
been submitted for detreated corn, a similar analysis could have been performed for the food additive regulation
at issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sampling results submitted by Mr. Hunt are no substitute for the magnitude-of-residue data requested. They represent
a single detreatment method under unspecified conditions. Several summary analysis reports are given, indicating
residues on detreated corn ranging from less than 0.01 ppm to 2.6 ppm. The analytical methods are not specified, and
no method validation data were included. Moreover, no data were provided on the same corn prior to detreatment. The
data are of the type that a business might use to monitor quality control in its process, but the data are totally inadequate
for fulfilling residue chemistry data requirements. Mr. Hunt appears to follow a careful procedure for not detreating
seed containing other than captan residues, but this alone is not grounds for maintaining the food additive regulation.
Finally, EPA recognizes that Mr. Hunt may have a sizable investment in his operation, but tolerances and food additive
regulations are rules of national application, and Mr. Hunt's investment cannot justify maintaining the legality
of these pesticide residues nationwide.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the objections are denied. This Order is issued under FFDCA section 409(f) and is subject to judicial
review as provided in FFDCA section 409(g).

The EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and
maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous
Substances Superfund Response Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from
the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if conditions at the site warrant such action. Deletion
of a site from the NPL does not effect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated
with response efforts.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order amends the amateur service rules to provide an electronic filing capability to the volunteer-examiner
coordinators (VECs), to clarify that amateur station and operator licensees are authorized as soon as the license
data is entered into the Commission's licensee data base, and to reflect other non-substantive procedural changes.
This action is necessary because recent modernization of the Commission's data processing capabilities makes it
possible to greatly reduce the time it takes for us to grant licenses in the amateur service, and all of the VECs have
notified us that they want to begin electronic filing of license application data as soon as possible. The intended
effect of this action is to allow successful license examinees to operate their amateur stations as soon as possible.
The text of the final rules is at the end of this document.

1. This is a summary of the Order adopted October 17, 1994, and released October 24, 1994. The complete text of this Order,
including the rule amendments, may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription
Service, (202) 857&hyph;3800, 2100 M Street NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.

2. Accepting from the VECs electronically filed data from applications for new and upgraded amateur operator licenses,
will eliminate the time and effort required for the VECs to send, and for the Commission to receive, application documents
by mail. As part of their routine operations, the VECs enter the data from the application documents they receive into
an electronic form that can be sent at high speed over telephone lines to our license processing facility. This data
can be used as received so that our license processors could discontinue manually reentering the data into the processing
system. We have been making arrangements with the VECs to enable them to use electronic filing procedures similar
to those that have been implemented for certain private land mobile radio services. The FCC Form 610 has been revised
to accommodate electronic filing. VECs may also continue to send by mail to our license processing facility the application
documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The decision to grant a license occurs when our license processing facility enters the data into the amateur service
licensee data base. Currently, however, the new licensee must delay beginning operation until a license document
can be printed, mailed, and delivered. This procedure can result in several weeks delay during which the licensee
cannot operate an amateur station. Fortunately, information technology is making our amateur service licensee
data base more widely available, thus diminishing the need for an amateur operator to hold a license document before
exercising the privileges authorized by the grant of the license. We are amending the rules, therefore, to authorize
operation on the basis of the licensee data appearing in the amateur service licensee data base. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Beginning in 1995, our new system also will give us the capability to make a timely mailing to a licensee's address
of record a renewal short form, filled in and ready for signature. We are amending the rules to allow this form to be used.
Because we cannot be certain of delivery of the form to every licensee in every instance, however, we will also continue
to allow the Form 610 to be used for renewing licenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. We are also combining into &sect;97.509 all of the administering volunteers examiner (VE) requirements that are
presently stated in four separate rule sections, and adding new &sect;97.511, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Examinee conduct, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to emphasize that an examinee must comply with the instructions given by the administering VEs. Further, we are amending
&sect;97.9 to treat Technician Plus as a license class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. We certify that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 does not apply to the amended rules because there will not
be any significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities, as defined by section 601(3)
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The amateur service may not be used to transmit communications for compensation,
for the pecuniary benefit of the station control operator or the station control operator's employer, or for communications,
on a regular basis, which could reasonably be furnished through other radio services.

station license, the application must be made on FCC Form 610. For a club, military recreation, or RACES station license,
the application must be made on FCC Form 610&hyph;B. Unless and until the license is renewed, no privileges in this
part are conferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Each application for a modified or renewed amateur service license must be accompanied by a photocopy (or the original)

document has been lost, mutilated or destroyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Unless the holder of a station license requests a change in call sign, the same call sign will be assigned to the station

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice amends Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108 to specify that plastic materials used in reflex
reflectors show not more than 7 percent haze after a 3-year outdoor exposure test, a level at which haze becomes discernable
to the naked eye. This amendment will not change the stringency of the standard as it has been applied, but it will increase
its objectivity. NHTSA has not adopted its proposal that cumulative haze not exceed 7 percent when a plastic lens is
placed in front of a reflex reflector. Instead, the same haze criterion is applied to the reflex reflector and outer
lens material. This approach will limit cumulative haze to about the same level without the need to retest current
materials.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sierra Products of Livermore, California (``Sierra'') filed a ``Petition to Amend FMVSS 108 Updating Weather &amp;
Heat Testing of Vehicle Lights &amp; Reflectors.'' In granting the petition, NHTSA considered that three principal
issues and several lesser issues merited public consideration and comment. An appropriate notice of proposed rulemaking
(NPRM) was published on March 9, 1993, and an opportunity afforded for comment (58 FR 13042). Its primary subject concerned
the permissibility of a minimum amount of haze. NHTSA noted that if any of the other issues merited the initiation of
rulemaking, a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking would follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comments on the NPRM were received from Trucklite, Truck Safety Equipment Institute (TSEI), American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), 3M, Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporation (GM),
Japan Auto Parts Industries Association (JAPIA), Peterson Manufacturing, Thomas Loughran, and General Electric
Plastics (GEP).

1. Haze Limit for Reflex Reflectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal issue of the NPRM concerned the permissible amount of haze after outdoor exposure testing of reflex
reflectors. S5.1.2 of Standard No. 108 establishes requirements for plastic materials used for optical parts such
as lenses and reflectors. One of the requirements (subsection (c)) is that plastic materials used for reflex reflectors
shall meet the appearance requirements of paragraph 4.2.2 of SAE Recommended Practice J576c, May 1970, after the
3-year exposure test specified in the Recommended Practice. Paragraph 4.2.2 states in pertinent part that ``The
exposed samples, when compared with the unexposed control samples, shall not show *&blank;*&blank;* haze *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Whether a sample shows haze has traditionally been determined by whether haze is visible to the naked eye. However,
all plastics will develop an amount of haze during the weathering test that may not be visible to the naked eye, but which
is measurable by instrumentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Electric, the manufacturer of ``Lexan,'' a polycarbonate plastic resin used in reflex reflectors, has stated
that its polycarbonate plastic will not pass the weathering test for reflector material unless the reflex reflector
manufacturer coats the finished product with an optical coating approved by GE. In its latest revision of J576, SAE
has replaced the visual inspection criterion for haze with a 7-percent haze limit for measurement with a hazometer.
The committee recommending the change considered the new procedure equivalent to the previous practice but more
objective. Properly coated polycarbonates develop about 6 percent haze, and acrylics develop about 3 percent haze
in exposure tests conducted in Florida. Such products are certified under the present test and will remain in compliance.
NHTSA notes that 7 percent haze is not difficult to discern visually.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neither Standard No. 108 nor SAE J576c ``requires'' coating, although that process may, in fact, be the most practicable
way to meet the requirements of both. The present requirement may imply the absence of haze after weathering, but an
absolute requirement of zero haze is neither practicable nor appropriate. Industry studies used by the SAE Lighting
Committee have demonstrated that degradation of reflex reflector performance can be limited to less than 17 percent
by preventing haze in excess of 7 percent, but that degradation increases rapidly with further haze to a loss of over
80 percent of initial performance at 21 percent haze. To control reflex reflector degradation and to make the haze
test more objective, the SAE amended its Recommended Practice to establish a maximum allowable limit of 7 percent
haze for plastics used for reflex reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal was opposed by AAMA, Ford, Chrysler, GM, and JAPIA. AAMA (supported in these views by Ford, Chrysler,
GM, and GEP) believes that the rulemaking is premature for two reasons. The first is that ``the agency has not identified
any safety problem arising from inadequacies'' in the existing requirement. The second is that ``there is no currently
available information [to motor vehicle manufacturers] that relates haze test data for plastic materials currently
used to the performance of reflex reflectors.'' It recommended that the agency withdraw its NPRM and issue an ANPRM
on the subject. The comments of JAPIA were similar in that it requested an effective date for the final rule 5 years after
its issuance to review its appropriateness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA disagrees that the rulemaking is premature. The purpose of the rulemaking is to ensure that an existing requirement
will more closely conform to that portion of the statutory definition of a Federal motor vehicle safety standard that
it ``provides objective criteria.'' (15 U.S.C. 1391(2)). The ``inadequacy'', to use AAMA's term, of the existing
requirement is that it is subjective. As for the second argument, the SAE considered industry data on reflector performance
with various haze filters fitted in front of a reflex reflector to quantify performance loss with increased haze,
and it reported a subjective demonstration test also using haze filters (haze filters were used in the experiments
rather than reflectors in various weathered states because reflector facets prevent the use of a hazeometer to measure
the degree of haze). NHTSA believes that the needs for safety are met by the current requirement that plastic materials
used in optical parts such as lenses meet the weathering test. Absent any treatment of the raw materials that affects
its ability to meet J576 (see discussion below), optical parts fashioned from complying plastic materials ought
to have the same haze resistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAMA also commented that the proposal would increase the stringency of haze requirements: ``[w]hereas the current
Standard calls for no visually-perceptible 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
change
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in haze resulting from outdoor exposure, the proposed revision would set a limit on the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
total
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 haze of the exposed sample. Even unexposed samples exhibit some measurable haze that would be additive to any incremental
haze produced by the three year outdoor exposure test.'' AAMA is not aware of any body of test data demonstrating whether
plastic materials used in current reflex reflectors are capable of meeting a post-exposure limit of 7 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present requirement contained in 4.2.2 of SAE J576c states that ``the exposed samples, when compared with the
unexposed control samples, shall not show surface deterioration, crazing, haze, dimensional changes, color bleeding,
delamination, or loss of surface luster.'' The determination of surface deterioration, dimensional changes, and
color bleeding require comparison with control samples. But the SAE bases its interpretation of the haze requirement
on the premise that low levels of haze are invisible to the naked eye, and it is certainly inappropriate for the samples
to have visible haze before exposure. Therefore, the haze test is actually absolute; the only criterion is whether
the exposed sample has visible haze. The ``comparison'' of visible haze to invisible haze is nothing more than a determination
of the visible haze. Implicit in the visual test requirement is a mutually exclusive concept of haze_it is either visible
or it is not visible. The concept of relative haze has little meaning unless the instrumentation of the proposed method
of measurement is used.

NHTSA presumes that the certification of present materials is based on test data in the possession of material manufacturers.
It is likely that haze measurements as well as visual inspection have been performed on current materials following
exposure to weathering, but visual inspections alone should be sufficient. It is not difficult to detect 7 percent
haze visually and samples already found to endure weathering without the development of visually perceptible haze
are unlikely to have developed more than 7 percent haze. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal was supported by Trucklite, TSEI, and Peterson. They pointed out that the SAE Lighting Committee haze
task force unanimously recommended the 7 percent haze limit in part because it did not affect the use of plastic resins
currently employed for reflex reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On balance, the agency has concluded that there is no demonstrable reason not to adopt the 7 percent haze limitation
for plastic materials used for reflex reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second part of the NPRM concerned a proposed cumulative haze limit of 7 percent when a plastic reflex reflector
is installed behind a plastic outer lens and not exposed directly to sunlight. This was based upon draft SAE language
and was opposed by the commenters. Subsequent to the NPRM the SAE modified its draft so that a cumulative haze limit
was an optional part of its specification. NHTSA has decided not to impose a cumulative haze limit of 7 percent, but
simply to adopt the same criterion (7 percent haze limit with direct exposure). Thus, S5.1.2(c) as amended by this
notice will apply the limit and other criteria to ``plastic materials used for reflex reflectors and for lenses used
in front of reflex reflectors.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment from GE indicated that while uncoated ``Lexan'' would develop in excess of 30 percent haze in a Florida exposure
test, the addition of a glass covering lens would limit haze to 4 to 6 percent. GE also offered data to show that plastic
covering lenses provided similar benefits. In view of the vast reduction in ultraviolet exposure of inner reflectors
afforded by glass or plastic outer lenses, the agency concluded that acrylic and coated polycarbonate materials,
which experience less than 7 percent haze under direct exposure, would experience negligible haze when protected
by an outer lens. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider cumulative haze when material suitable for direct exposure
is used with a covering lens, also suitable for direct exposure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA's decision not to adopt the cumulative haze provision should allay industry concerns regarding the lack of
test data to continue recertifying existing designs using covered reflex reflectors, but it may have the effect of
necessitating an optical coating on any polycarbonate reflex reflectors which previously relied on an outer lens
to prevent the formation of visible haze. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SAE haze task force had also considered applying the 7 percent haze limit to plastic headlamp lenses as well as reflex
reflectors, but it decided that more work was required to define the safety needs of headlamps. The revision of SAE
J576 left the headlamp lens requirement unchanged from previous versions. It states that ``plastic material used
for forward road illumination devices, excluding cornering lamps, shall show no deterioration.'' It is not clear
whether that specification is meant to be more restrictive than the 7 percent haze limit for reflectors, but it has
the same effect in practice as the visual inspection requirement had for reflex reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that in Standard No. 108, plastic lenses of replaceable bulb headlamps are subject to an abrasion resistance
test, and that most, if not all, lenses must be given an abrasion resistant coating to meet it. It has been the agency's
assumption that the hard coating would also protect headlamps lenses against excessive haze. Standard No. 108 does
not require the abrasion test for plastic sealed beam headlamps, but NHTSA believes that it is industry practice to
coat plastic sealed beam lamps. To pursue the subject of haze limitations for headlamp lens material, NHTSA requested
that commenters address five specific issues. Ford was the sole commenter on the first four issues. These issues and
Ford's comments follow: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether there are any replaceable bulb headlamps with plastic lenses that do not use a hard coating to achieve abrasion
resistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford's headlamps of this type all employ a hard coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether all abrasion resistant coatings also prevent the formation of more than 7 percent haze on samples of plastics
used in headlamp lenses which are subjected to the 3-year test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Ford's experience, coatings prevent formation of haze that exceeds 7 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether there are any sealed beam headlamps with plastic lenses that do not use a hard coating for either haze or
abrasion resistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford used headlamps of this type in two model lines for one model year each a decade and a half ago. The lamps used an acrylic
coating to prevent yellowing of the polycarbonate lens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Whether the adoption of a 7 percent haze limit for plastic headlamp lenses would create a burden on industry, and
if so, the nature and severity of the burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford does not believe that it would create a burden ``except possibly for some initial additional testing.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Whether the industry favors harmonization of Standard No. 108 with SAE J576 for haze resistance of plastic headlamp
lens materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford and another commenter, Truck-Lite, supported application of Standard No. 108 to materials for plastic headlamp
lenses, albeit with the more recent versions of SAE J576, those of 1986 and 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears that the abrasion resistance requirements for replaceable bulb headlamps and the industry practice of
hard coating sealed beams already act to prevent haze on plastic headlamp lenses that exceed 7 percent. NHTSA remains
interested in any SAE attempts to establish an appropriate haze criterion for headlamp lenses, but it appears that
there is no safety need for rulemaking at present.

2. Thermal Degradation of Acrylic Reflex Reflectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sierra also claimed that current weathering tests do not address the loss of reflector performance for causes other
than haze. It criticized the agency for deleting the lens warpage test in 1973 which regulated distortion from heat.
Before then, Standard No. 108 incorporated the heat test of SAE Standard J575d which consisted of operating a lamp
for one hour in a chamber heated to 120 degrees F. The lamp would reach a temperature higher than that from the heat of
the filament. At the conclusion of the test, no warpage could result that would ``affect the proper functioning of
the device.'' Since the requirement was ambiguous, NHTSA eliminated it. However, in light of Sierra's complaint,
NHTSA has reviewed the matter. When the heat test was deleted, the principal concern of the test seemed to be gross distortions
of through-optic lenses. It appears that the heat damage to a lens with an integral reflex reflector was not considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are limited data indicating that acrylic reflex reflectors may suffer from heat degradation. The General Electric
Company (GE) has reported (NHTSA Docket No. 108&hyph;PRM&hyph;000015&hyph;01) a weathering test in Florida in
which amber and yellow acrylic reflex reflectors decreased in specific intensity by 18 to 32 percent after an exposure
of one year, regardless of the angle of exposure. GE attributed the decrease in photometric performance to minute
distortions of the reflex lens (which the industry calls ``creep'') which occurred when the plastics were exposed
to direct sunlight (temperatures of 150 to 160 degrees F). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of this test, NHTSA sought comments on the potential problem of heat degradation of acrylic plastic reflex
reflectors. NHTSA requested commenters to address the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the commenter has test or other data relating to the performance of acrylic reflectors after exposure
to heat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The threshold temperatures for creep and stress relaxation for acrylic plastics used for lamp lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether creep will stabilize or continue indefinitely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The maximum temperature acrylic lenses may endure without experiencing visible deformation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The length of exposure required for stability at slightly over the threshold temperature and at the maximum temperature
stated in response to (4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The maximum loss of photometric performance to be expected if the creep and stress relaxation eventually stabilize.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The maximum operating temperature of multiple function rear lamps on passenger cars, trucks, and trailers under
realistic extreme conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Whether integral reflex reflectors would degrade under the conditions stated in response to (7).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(9) The test procedures that would be effective and practicable for testing reflectors and lamps with integral reflectors
for the purpose of detecting which devices would degrade significantly in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received from TSEI, Peterson, 3M, Ford, and Trucklite. They reported that acrylic devices are designed
to operate up to about 170 degrees F and that stress relaxation begins at about 180 degrees. A heat test of plastic samples
at 175 degrees F is incorporated by reference in Standard No. 108. The amount of distortion experienced at temperatures
between 180 and 200 degrees F depends on the residual stress at the particular location, and the speed at which it stabilizes
depends on the temperature. Unlike haze, creep is not indefinitely progressive; stabilization occurs in a matter
of hours at elevated temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All lamp manufacturers reported using a heat warpage test of some sort, even though no longer required by Standard
No. 108. Some test more stringently than SAE J575d. Some commenters reported using photometric testing after a heat
warpage test while others used a visual examination (the method set forth in SAE J575d). Peterson reported that acrylic
lenses with reflectors subjected to SAE J575d show less than 5 percent losses in photometric brightness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency eliminated the warpage test because it did not deem it required for safety. The degradation of acrylic reflectors
alleged by Sierra would not be detected under SAE J575d which specifies a visual inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creep would affect a reflex reflector in a way fundamentally different from haze. Haze reduces the brightness of the
reflector at all light entrance angles. Creep may cause the reflex reflector to lose brightness at some angles while
gaining brightness at other angles. It appears unlikely that the loss of brightness reported by General Electric
was the result of creep. GE did not test the acrylic reflectors thoroughly enough to make well founded conclusions
about their performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, there is no evidence that reflex reflectors degrade before other visible damage occurs.

3. Dye Loss of Acrylic Reflectors and Lenses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sierra claimed that the weathering test of Standard No. 108 is inadequate because complying red and amber acrylic
lenses lose their color in use. NHTSA responded that the breakdown of the dye may not be a property of the plastic but
of the dye itself. Dyes with higher temperature tolerance are frequently used in polycarbonate products because
they may be designed for higher temperature applications than acrylic products, but there is no property of acrylic
plastic which contributes to fading. NHTSA understands, however, that the SAE adopted the three-year test when plastic
began to replace glass because of some concern that plastic would not be as fade resistant as glass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requested that commenters provide information on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the commenter has test or other data relating to fading or loss of dye color in acrylic or polycarbonate
lenses through exposure to heat or weathering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether any data exist indicating that acrylic or polycarbonate lenses fade or do not fade under realistic operating
conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Whether the three-year test of SAE J576, conducted in Florida and Arizona, is sufficient to identify plastic materials
prone to fade in color. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The kind of test procedure that would be effective and practicable for testing lenses or plastic materials used
in lenses to detect any propensity to fade significantly in service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were received from TSEI, Peterson, 3M, Ford, Trucklite, and Thomas Loughran. The commenters believe that
the three year weathering test of SAE J576 is adequate to identify plastic materials that are prone to fading. Acrylic
materials do not appear to have a greater tendency to fade than polycarbonate materials. Peterson has observed that
dyes used in acrylic material darken slightly as a result of sustained exposure to sunlight. TSEI reported that the
only faded lenses in service which have been observed by its membership have been identified as made of noncomplying
materials. Mr Loughran suggested that faded lenses result from the practice of blending virgin and reground material
with additional dye at the time of molding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford suggested that a modified xenon accelerated weathering test would be effective for testing colored plastic
materials for their propensity to fade in service. This test would be configured to correlate with the three year weathering
test. The object of accelerated testing with xenon lamps would be increased productivity rather than increased accuracy
of detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments were unanimous in supporting the existing rule as an effective and sufficient test for dye loss of lamp
and reflector materials. However, it appears from Mr. Loughran's comment that the uncontrolled use of reground material
and added dye can create noncomplying plastic material to a greater degree than the lamp industry recognizes. NHTSA
believes that the fading problem observed by the petitioner is the likely result of lamp manufacturing practices
brought to its attention by Mr. Loughran. Accordingly, there appears to be no reason to change the present weathering
test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Mr. Loughran's comments, NHTSA takes this opportunity to present its views on the obligations of a
manufacturer of reflex reflectors. The haze requirement is imposed by S5.1.2 upon ``plastic materials used in optical
parts''. SAE Standard J594f ``Reflex Reflectors'' January 1977 as incorporated into Standard No. 108 at 3.2 references
the plastic material test of SAE J576. This imposes an obligation upon the manufacturer of a reflex reflector to use
plastic materials meeting J576. Thus, the manufacturer has an obligation to ensure that its acts do nothing to negate
the conformance of the raw material with the tests of J576 when it is fashioned into reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A weathering test performed by NHTSA and comments to the docket suggest that lamp manufacturers need to take care that
their coating practices actually meet the specifications used by plastic manufacturers to certify material properties.
NHTSA's test included coated and uncoated ``Lexan'' samples exposed in Florida and Arizona. The uncoated samples
failed the test visually as well as by the development of more than 7 percent haze before the end of the first year at both
exposure sites. At the end of the second year, the coated Arizona sample had developed slightly less than 7 percent
haze, but haze was plainly visible. The coated Florida sample had failed in both respects with 10.5 percent haze after
a two-year exposure. Its uncoated mate had developed 10.3 percent haze in one year. At the end of the third year, the
large haze reductions of the coated specimens, seen after one- and two-years exposure, had disappeared. Both Arizona
specimens had slightly less than 20 percent haze and both Florida specimens had slightly more than 30 percent haze.
The 24-month results were available at the time of the NPRM and were placed in the docket.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TSEI and Peterson commented on the 24-month test results, and Thomas Loughran's comment is relevant to cases of premature
degradation. TSEI and Peterson consider the failure of coated sample to be an anomaly, uncharacteristic of the performance
of all other coated polycarbonates in their experience. In their view, the failure is due to a faulty coating. Peterson
suggested that either the coating thickness or the curing process was not performed in accordance with the plastic
manufacturer's specifications. The rapid surface degradation of both coated samples occurring in the period between
24 and 36 months exposure and the apparent flaking of the coating of the Arizona 18-month specimen support Peterson's
opinion of faulty coating. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Loughran was concerned that coated polycarbonates may not meet the 7 percent haze limit either as samples or as
finished products. He cited knowledge of Arizona exposure tests in which coated polycarbonate reflectors suffered
60 percent to 70 percent losses in reflective performance, and he suggested testing of finished products as well as
material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Loughran's experience appears to be at odds with the confidence of TSEI, Peterson, Trucklite, and the SAE haze
task force that coated polycarbonate plastic will haze less than 7 percent in a 3-year exposure test. However, it is
likely that departures from virgin material and poor coating practices can combine to cause inferior performance
in products nominally made from certified materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These data suggest the beneficent effect of coating on polycarbonate plastic will not be sufficiently durable to
meet the performance certified after the material unless the material manufacturer's recommendations are followed
rigorously. While the presence of some coating material does not guarantee compliance, the absence of coating seems
to ensure that plastics such as polycarbonates will quickly fail the haze test. Use of coatings with a tint element
visible under an ultraviolet inspection light affords a simple, practicable way for regulatory bodies such as NHTSA
to discern whether relevant plastic materials have been coated. The 3-year test period appears to be unnecessarily
long in those instances where test failures occur long in advance, such as samples that manifest haze at the end of an
exposure of only a year's duration. Failure to tint, and premature hazing afforded a basis upon which NHTSA can determine
noncompliance without having to complete pro forma the 3-year test period and unnecessarily delay the remedy of a
noncompliant product.

4. Miscellaneous Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3M suggested that a test measuring reflective brightness before and after exposure of retroreflective devices be
established as an alternative to haze testing so that sheeting material devices could qualify as reflex reflectors.
No specific test procedures or criteria were included in the comment. Because this issue is beyond the scope of the
present rulemaking, it could not be not considered in formulating the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rulemaking action has not been considered under E.O. 12866. NHTSA has considered the impacts of this rulemaking
action and has determined that it is not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and
procedures. The stringency of the haze requirement would not be changed. Further, manufacturers of plastic materials
are currently measuring the haze of weathered samples by ASTM D 1003, which will govern the certification to the 7 percent
haze limit. In addition, according to the agency's observation that haze not detectable by the human eye is also less
than 7 percent, conformance of a reflector with the haze requirement could still be judged with the naked eye. Impacts
of the final rule are, therefore, be so minimal as not to warrant preparation of a full regulatory evaluation.

The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small
entities. Manufacturers of plastic materials are generally not small businesses within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly affected
as the price of new motor vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be impacted. Accordingly, no Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared.

This rule would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 (formerly section 103(d) of the National Traffic
and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a
state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance which is not identical
to the Federal standard. Forty-nine U.S.C. 30161 (formerly Section 105 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 1394)) sets forth a procedure
for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending, or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings
before parties may file suit in court.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Snake River fall chinook salmon from threatened to endangered status under the emergency provisions of the
Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act). This reflects a determination by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which
has jurisdiction for these species, that the species warrant emergency reclassification based on a projected decline
in adult Snake River chinook salmon abundance. This determination by NMFS was published in the August 18, 1994,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), and in accordance with Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970,
the National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of
Commerce, is responsible for the Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon. Under section 4(a)(2) of the
Act, NMFS must decide whether a species under its jurisdiction should be classified as endangered or threatened.
The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is responsible for the actual addition, deletion and amendment of the List
of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in 50 CFR 17.11(h) (List). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS published its determination of threatened status for the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon and the Snake
River fall chinook salmon on April 22, 1992 (57 FR 14653). Accordingly, the Service added the species to the List on
September 23, 1993 (58 FR 49880). On August 18, 1994, NMFS published an emergency interim rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 42529) reclassifying the Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon and the Snake River fall chinook salmon
from threatened to endangered status based on new data that indicates that critically low salmon returns are expected
for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Service is amending the List, pursuant to the emergency provisions of section 4(b)(7) of the Act,
to reflect the revised status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 240 days this emergency rule is in effect, NMFS will initiate and complete a rulemaking (with a public comment
period) to extend the reclassification of Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook salmon to endangered status
under the Act until such time as reclassification or delisting is warranted. This action of the Service to amend the
List in accordance with the determination by NMFS is nondiscretionary. Therefore, in view of the public comment period
that will be provided by NMFS on the proposed reclassification, the Service finds that good cause exists to omit the
notice and public comment procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and to make this action effective on August 18, 1994, the date
of publication of NMFS' emergency interim rule, waiving the 30-day effective date provision of 5 U.S.C. 553(d).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Coral and coral reefs in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states and in the Gulf of Mexico are managed under the Fishery
Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by
the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and is implemented through regulations at 50 CFR
part 638 under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under an emergency interim rule effective through September 26, 1994 (59 FR 32938, June 27, 1994), and extended through
December 25, 1994 (59 FR 47563, September 16, 1994), NMFS established a 1994 harvest quota of 485,000 lb (219,992 kg)
for live rock in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states. Section 638.28(d) of that emergency interim rule requires
the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), to close the live rock fishery in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic
states when the 1994 harvest quota is reached, or is projected to be reached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AA has determined that the quota will be reached on October 31, 1994. Accordingly, the live rock fishery in the South
Atlantic EEZ is closed effective 12:01 a.m., local time, November 1, 1994, through December 25, 1994, the end of the
period of effectiveness of the emergency interim rule. During the closure, live rock may not be harvested or possessed
in the EEZ off the southern Atlantic states, and the purchase, barter, trade, and sale of live rock in or from the EEZ
off the southern Atlantic states is prohibited. The latter prohibition does not apply to live rock that was harvested
prior to November 1, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 5, 1994 (59 FR 50699), NMFS published a final rule to implement a regulatory amendment establishing standard
groundfish product types and standard product recovery rates (PRRs) for purposes of managing the groundfish fisheries
off Alaska and specify certain product types and PRRs that may be used to calculate round-weight equivalents of pollock
for purposes of calculating amounts of pollock roe that may be retained onboard a vessel during the pollock fishery.
The final rule is to be effective November 4, 1994. In that rule, the amendatory instruction that revises &sect;672.20
was inadvertently omitted.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management
Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels
is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for Pacific ocean perch in the Bering
Sea subarea (BS), and for yellowfin sole and arrowtooth flounder in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management
area, need to be supplemented from the nonspecific reserve in order to continue operations and account for prior harvest.
Therefore, in accordance with &sect;675.20(b), NMFS is apportioning from the reserve to TACs for the following species:
(1) For the BS-286 metric tons (mt) to Pacific ocean perch; (2) for the BSAI-22,549 mt to yellowfin sole and 1,500 mt
to arrowtooth flounder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These apportionments are consistent with &sect;675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target species
or the ``other species'' category, because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable
biological catch.

Classification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined, under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act and 50 CFR 675.20(b)(2), that good cause exists for waiving the opportunity for public comment and the
30-day delayed effectiveness period for this action. Fisheries are currently taking place that will be supplemented
by this apportionment. Delaying the implementation of this action would be disruptive and costly to these ongoing
operations.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Securities and Exchange Commission announces the adoption of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which, together, require enhanced disclosure of payment for order flow
practices on customer confirmations, and account statements, as well as upon opening new accounts. The new Rule and
amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 are designed to provide relevant information to customers regarding factors influencing
the routing of their orders. The new Rule and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 also will serve to enhance investor protection
and further competition for retail orders by enabling customers to evaluate more effectively the markets to which
their orders are routed.

I. Executive Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On October 6, 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') proposed for comment amendments
to Rule 10b&hyph;10 (17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10) and new Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 (17 CFR 240.11Ac1&hyph;3) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') concerning payment for order flow practices.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Taken together, those proposals were designed to improve information available to investors about their broker-dealer's
order routing practices, and whether the broker-dealer received market center
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 inducements for routing unspecified order flow to them. These disclosures would occur when the investor opened an
account, annually thereafter, and on the required trade confirmations. In the Proposing Release, the Commission
invited commenters to address issues related to the proposals as well as alternative approaches to payment for order
flow, such as banning the practice outright, mandatory pass-through of payments to customers, and requiring exchanges,
national securities associations and broker-dealers to convert to decimal pricing.

that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.''

The Commission is modifying Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 as proposed, to include Nasdaq
Small-Cap and Over-The-Counter (``OTC'') Bulletin Board securities. The Commission also is modifying the proposed
amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to limit the disclosure of payment for order flow on customer confirmations to a statement
that the broker or dealer receives payment for order flow. In addition, the Commission is revising proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3
regarding customer account statements by requiring disclosure of the broker-dealer's policies for determining
where to route customer orders that are the subject of payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers,
including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the national best bid or
best offer (``NBBO'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a parallel action, the Commission is proposing for comment amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3
that would extend those Rules to the options market.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose in writing, on confirmations,
upon opening new accounts and on annual disclosure statements, ranges of payment for order flow received on a per share
basis; and include, in new account documentation and on annual disclosure statements, an estimate of the aggregate
amount of payment for order flow received on an annual basis.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission also is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose whether they execute orders
as principal (``internalize'') or route orders to an affiliated broker-dealer or exchange specialist for execution
and, a requirement that broker-dealers quantify and disclose information about internalized/affiliate practices.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission further is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose their order routing
practices regardless of whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow or engaged in internalized/affiliate
practices. The Companion Release also solicits comment on expanding the definition of payment for order flow.

II. Basis and Purpose of the Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The practice of paying for order flow has generated much debate and controversy
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 regarding the potential benefits and harm to public investors and whether receipt and retention of payment for order
flow compromises a broker-dealer's duties to its customer.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Congress has shown continuing interest in the resolution of that controversy.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The history of that debate and other background information can be found in the Proposing Release.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 In their response to the Proposing Release, few commenters suggested that the Commission not act at all regarding
payment for order flow practices.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Most commenters supported the disclosure approach, with modifications. These commenters suggested that payment
for order flow practices are a mechanism for competition among market centers for order flow. Many commenters argued
that there is no harm in these practices. Others argued that disclosure to the customer adequately would address any
perceived conflict of interest.

As noted in the Proposing Release, payment for order flow may result in lower execution costs, facilitate technological
advances in retail customer order handling practices and facilitate competition among broker-dealers and securities
markets. At the same time, however, the practice raises concern as to whether the customer is being treated fairly.
Specifically, payment for order flow raises concerns about whether a firm is meeting its obligation of best execution
to its customer. Not all market centers expose market orders to other order flow or attempt to improve the price at which
market orders are executed. Thus, the decision to route an unpriced order to a market center offering immediate execution
at the NBBO, could mean that the customer has lost an opportunity for execution at a superior price because of the lack
of exposure to other order flow.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes disclosure that payment for order flow has been received
and a description of whether the customer's order has an opportunity for price improvement will enhance investor
protection and provide customers with information to evaluate more effectively the markets to which their orders
are routed.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rules adopted today represent a tiered approach to disclosure of payment for order flow practices in the broader
context of broker-dealer order handling practices and the special relationship that already exists between a broker-dealer
and its customer.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The components of the Rules include disclosure at the time an account is opened, annually thereafter, and on the transaction
confirmation.

A broker-dealer's duty to seek to obtain best execution of customer orders derives, in part, from the common law agency
duty of loyalty, which obligates an agent to act exclusively in the principal's best interest. Restatement 2d Agency
section 387 (1958). Thus, when an agent acts on behalf of a customer in a transaction, the agent is under a duty to exercise
reasonable care to obtain the most advantageous terms for the customer. Restatement 2d Agency section 424 (1958).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the Rules adopted today require broker-dealers to inform customers in writing, when a new account is opened,
about the dealer's policies regarding the receipt of payment for order flow, including whether payment for order
flow is received; and a detailed description of the nature of the compensation received. As discussed in greater detail
below, the new Rule and Rule amendments require that broker-dealers provide information in account opening documents
about order routing decisions in orders subject to payment for order flow, including an explanation of the extent
to which unpriced orders can be executed at prices superior to the displayed NBBO at the time the order is received.
Second, the Rules adopted today require dealers to update this information and to provide such information annually
to all customers. Taken together, this information should assist customers in assessing the quality of trade executions
they receive and encourage broker-dealers to consider the opportunity for price improvement in establishing order
routing arrangements. Finally, the Rules adopted today require broker-dealers to indicate on confirmations whether
the broker or dealer receives payment for order flow, and the availability of further information on request. These
are described in greater detail below, beginning with the scope of securities subject to the Rules and the types of
inducements covered by the Rules.

As proposed, the obligations of both Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and the amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 were limited to orders
in national market system securities. The Commission requested comment on whether both Rules should be extended
to Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board Securities.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters addressing this issue supported the inclusion of both and, accordingly, the Commission is expanding
Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to include these securities. As revised, both Rules would include
``any subject security as defined in &sect;240.11Ac1&hyph;2 or a security authorized for quotation on an automated
interdealer quotation system that has the characteristics set forth in Section 17B of the Act * * *.''

note 1, 58 FR at 52940 n.44 and n.46. Two commenters support the inclusion of Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board
securities in the Commission's proposal. One commenter states that if the goal of disclosure is to provide customers
with as much information as possible to make an informed decision regarding where to place their orders, it does not
make sense to limit the disclosure requirement to national market system securities but rather the requirement should
extend to Nasdaq Small-Cap and OTC Bulletin Board securities.

Two exchanges support the inclusion of options in the confirmation disclosure requirements. One exchange suggests
that the Commission consider the ramifications that payment for order flow may have on the options marketplace, especially
once multiple trading of options is taken into consideration.

The Commission believes that inclusion of these securities provides customers with the best picture of a broker-dealer's
policies regarding the routing of customer orders and the receipt of payment for order flow. As discussed in the Proposing
Release,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 the practice of payment for order flow originated in the OTC market, and since then has been routinely used as a competitive
tool in that market. Payments for Nasdaq and OTC Bulletin Board stocks, moreover, are generally greater than for exchange-listed
national market system securities.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that the disclosure protections should be extended to the OTC market.

2. Definition of Payment for Order Flow
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(9) defined payment for order flow broadly, to include all forms or arrangements
compensating for directing order flow. The Commission received 23 comment letters addressing the scope of the definition.
The majority of these commenters were supportive of the Commission's efforts and agreed that non-cash inducements
for order flow are economically equivalent to, and have the same effect as, cash payments for order flow. Opponents
of the proposed definition, which include most of the exchanges, argued that rebates and fee reductions are structurally
different from other cash payments and should be excluded from ``monetary'' payment for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission has considered all the comments, and for the reasons discussed below, believes that the items enumerated
in Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(9) appropriately include arrangements involving payment for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>

Several exchanges argue that, unlike cash payments, all exchange charges and fees are filed with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act and are a matter of public record. The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') added that
unlike exchange fee structures, dealers do not charge fees to brokers for use of their services; because there is no
``fee'' to discount, the NYSE argues that it is disingenuous to suggest any similarity between the two practices.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(9) defines payment for order flow to include any monetary payment, service, property, or any
other benefit that results in remuneration, compensation or consideration to a broker or dealer in return for the
routing of customer orders. Broker-dealers should examine order routing arrangements carefully, with a view toward
determining whether the firm has received some form of remuneration as a result of routing orders to that market. As
noted, payment for order flow includes non-monetary compensation, such as clearing services or reciprocal order
swapping arrangements. It is the Commission's view that monetary and non-monetary inducements are alternative
methods of payment to attract order flow and are economically equivalent.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 As such, non-cash remuneration is as likely to influence the broker's order routing decision as cash. In addition,
as is the case with monetary payments, the customer is unlikely to be aware of many of these practices. Thus, the net
effect of non-monetary arrangements is not appreciably different than that of monetary payment for order flow. Therefore,
the Commission concludes that non-monetary payment for order flow should be included in the definition and should
be subject to the regulatory treatment set forth in the proposal.

Payment for order flow also includes any credit, rebate, or discount against execution fees that exceeds the fee charged
for executing the order.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 It is the Commission's view that although SRO fee schedules are reviewed by the Commission under section 19(b) of the
Act and appear in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the connection between these fee arrangements and a member firm's order routing practices may not be known or apparent
to that firm's customers. Moreover, it is possible for an exchange to adjust its fee schedule for members routing orders
to provide the economic equivalent of payment for order flow. The existence of such remuneration to the firm, whether
in the form of monetary payments or other benefits, should be disclosed directly to customers.

Thus, payment for order flow would include a fee arrangement in which an exchange charges 50 cents per order but offers
a $2.00 per order credit for agency orders, which can be used to offset other fees incurred on that exchange.

on every small order (100&hyph;2099 shares) delivered via SuperDot and executed by the NYSE specialist). However,
payment for order flow would not include fee arrangements in which the market's net charge for executing the order,
after any discount, rebate, or credit, is greater than zero.

As initially proposed, ``payment for order flow'' was defined as ``any compensation received from any broker-dealer
(including market makers), exchange members, or exchanges to which a broker-dealer routes customers orders for
execution, including: Monetary payments, research, products or services *&blank;*&blank;* discounts and rebates,
or any other reduction of or credit against any fee, expense or other financial obligation of the broker or dealer routing
a customer order.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to comments, the Commission has clarified that the definition of payment for order flow includes discounts,
rebates, credits, or other fee arrangements only to the extent that such discounts exceed the fee charged. In addition,
the Commission has clarified that payment for order flow received from a registered securities association is also
subject to the disclosure rules. The Companion Release solicits comment on whether the definition of payment for
order flow should be expanded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 to require broker-dealers to provide to customers information regarding
their payment for order flow practices when a new account is opened and to all customers annually. The Commission is
modifying the Rule to require a description of the broker-dealer's policies for determining where to route customer
orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers, including a description
of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the NBBO.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, the revised Rule requires broker-dealers to disclose whether they receive payment for order flow. If any type
of payment for order flow is received, the broker-dealer must provide a detailed description of the nature of the compensation
received and, as discussed below, information about the routing of unspecified orders and whether those orders can
be executed at prices better than the NBBO at the time the order is received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Order Routing and Best Execution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent that market center structures differ materially in the opportunity for unpriced orders to be executed
at prices that are superior to the NBBO, the receipt of payment for order flow could be viewed as improperly affecting
a dealer's determination regarding where to route customer orders and the dealer's ability to satisfy its best execution
obligation, if the dealer does not provide as good an overall opportunity for best execution as it would without the
payment for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, this could happen when dealers decide to route orders to a market center which does not provide an opportunity
for price improvement, although other factors such as the size of the order, speed of execution, and the costs and difficulty
associated with achieving best execution in a particular market may negate this conclusion.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission noted in the Proposing Release that broker-dealers are under a duty to seek the ``best execution''
of their customer's orders.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Broker-dealers accepting remuneration from a market center for directing order flow to that market center are still
obligated to fulfill their duty of best execution to their customers.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission understands that most firms that pay for order flow guarantee, at a minimum, executions at the NBBO.
As stated in the Proposing Release, such so-called quote-derived executions in many ways are not materially different
from automated execution systems operated by the regional exchanges for years. While automated execution systems
offer fast and assured executions to customers, orders sent to an exchange for manual handling and orders sent to an
OTC dealer for manual (or in some cases automated) handling may have a greater opportunity for an execution between
the spread than do orders that are routed to a quote-based automated execution system.

A broker-dealer's duty to seek best execution of customer orders derives from, among other sources, the common law
agency duty of loyalty, which obligates an agent to act exclusively in the principal's best interest. The Commission
noted in the Proposing Release its concern that the availability of payments in return for order flow commitments
may influence the evaluation by a broker-dealer of the most advantageous market or market maker to whom to route its
customer order. Indeed, some opponents of the practice of payment for order flow believe that acceptance and retention
of payments by brokers from market makers constitute a breach of duty not permitted under agency common law.

See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Restatement 2d Agency section 388 (1958). While the Commission is concerned about a broker-dealer's fiduciary duty
to seek to obtain the best execution for its customer, it believes that bulk order routing based, in part, on the receipt
of payment for order flow is not, in and of itself, a violation of those duties. Disclosure of payment for order flow,
moreover, could help inform customers and negate the concern that customers are unable to evaluate whether they receive
inferior executions due to undisclosed rebates.

The Commission traditionally has concluded that a broker-dealer routing customer orders for automated execution
could satisfy its best execution obligations so long as the broker-dealer assesses periodically the quality of competing
markets to ensure that its order flow is directed to markets providing the most advantageous terms for its customers'
orders.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Nevertheless, the Commission's staff recently has warned against presuming that guaranteed executions at the best
bid or offer always will satisfy the broker-dealer's best execution duties for small orders in listed securities.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 For example, as a general matter, trades in listed securities routed to an exchange will be exposed to other public
orders or interest in the trading crowd, with the possibility that the order may receive a price that is better than
the existing quotations (so-called ``price improvement''). Most regional exchanges, for example, have incorporated
order exposure features into their small order routing and execution systems with a view toward offering price improvement.

 This feature by itself, however, rarely provides an execution between the spread. Most regional exchanges program
their automatic execution systems to ensure that customer orders receive a price at the NBBO or better, and the specialist
is provided an opportunity to improve the price. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (``Phlx'') does not have such a feature
in its automatic execution system, although the Commission has recommended for years that it be included.

The Commission believes that the possibility for price improvement, while not the exclusive factor, bears on the
question of whether a broker-dealer is fulfilling its duty to seek best execution, especially when payment is received
by the broker-dealer in return for guaranteeing order flow.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Although it may be impractical for a broker or dealer that handles a heavy volume of orders to make an individual determination
regarding where to route each order it receives, the broker or dealer must use due diligence to seek the best execution
possible given all facts and circumstances. The Commission believes a broker or dealer must assess whether the order
flow in the aggregate, is receiving best execution and that a broker-dealer must not allow a payment or an inducement
for order flow to interfere with its efforts to obtain best execution. Accordingly, in light of a broker-dealer's
obligation to assess periodically the quality of the markets to which it routes packaged order flow absent specific
instructions from customers, the Commission does not believe such a broker-dealer violates its best execution obligation
merely because it receives payment for order flow.

Because executions of market orders for listed stocks in an exchange market include the possibility for a price between
the quotes, the staff has concluded that the existence of this possibility, even if the price is not actually improved,
can be a factor in determining whether best execution has been sought.

In this connection, the Commission has taken several steps recently to expand the opportunity for customer market
orders to be executed at prices better than the NBBO at the time of receipt, including proposal of a Rule to require limit
order price protection in Nasdaq National Market securities.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 Nevertheless, considerable differences among market centers exist today. Accordingly, consistent with these
steps to help customers understand payment for order flow practices, and to facilitate fair competition among exchange
and non-exchange market centers, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to require broker-dealers to disclose
to customers their policies regarding where they route unspecified orders that are subject to payment for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 This provision requires a description of the extent to which orders so routed can be executed at prices superior to
the NBBO at the time the order is received. Dealers should explain, in simple terms, whether the market center to which
they route unspecified orders executes orders to purchase or sell at the NBBO and whether it provides an opportunity
for execution at prices superior to the NBBO.

Several commenters opposed annual disclosure because it would duplicate the account opening disclosure and suggested
that the Commission require additional disclosure only upon a material change in the firm's policies. The Commission
is retaining the annual disclosure requirement because it believes this will serve to remind customers that evaluation
of a dealer's services involves more than a comparison of commission rates and to encourage broker-dealers to continue
to evaluate the quality of service they receive from market centers from which they receive payment for order flow.

3. Quantification of Monetary Payment for Order Flow
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over 20 commenters addressed the proposed requirement that broker-dealers inform customers annually about the
aggregate amount of monetary compensation received for routing order flow. The majority oppose the inclusion of
any aggregate value requirement.
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission has determined to solicit further comment on this issue in the Companion Release because it believes
that aggregate information provides useful information to customers to evaluate the magnitude of payment for order
flow practices and whether such payments, taken as a whole, might affect adversely order routing determinations.
As discussed in the Companion Release, the Commission has determined to solicit further comment on this issue in conjunction
with its proposal to require valuation of all forms of payment for order flow because disclosure of monetary payment
for order flow without similar disclosures regarding non-monetary payment for order flow and internalization could
mislead investors or foster non-monetary payments or internalized/affiliate practices.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Several broker-dealers argue that disclosure of aggregate amounts of monetary order flow would be misleading to
customers. One commenter voiced concerns that investors who transact business in mutual funds or options would be
misled by disclosure which only derives from equity order flow. Others believe that even equity customers are likely
to be misled because payment derives from large numbers of the broker's own or other customer's orders directed to
various marketplaces which may be unrelated to that particular customer's business with the broker-dealer. Still
others believe that such disclosure may lead to the misperception that investors are being disadvantaged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the same commenters opposing aggregate disclosure of monetary compensation also oppose the
Commission's proposal regarding confirmation disclosure of monetary compensation.

<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 required customer confirmations to disclose whether any payment for order flow has been received for a national market
system security and the amount of any monetary payment, discount, rebate or reduction of fee. More than 30 commenters
expressed concern about the proposed requirement that broker-dealers disclose on customer order confirmations
the amount of any monetary payment, discount, rebate or reduction of fee received in connection with a transaction
in a national market system security. Most of these commenters considered this unworkable.

Currently, the Commission's confirmation disclosure rule, Rule 10b&hyph;10 under the Act, requires that confirmations
sent to customers for agency transactions disclose the ``price'' of the security purchased or sold by the customer,
as well as the remuneration paid to the broker-dealer by the customer in the trade. Rule 10b&hyph;10 also requires
broker-dealers to disclose the source and amount of any other remuneration received in connection with a transaction.
In most transactions, however, the Rule permits broker-dealers merely to state ``whether any other remuneration
has been or will be received,'' and to furnish the source and amount of such other remuneration on written request.

Several commenters argue that specific confirmation disclosure is nearly impossible considering that brokers
have a variety of arrangements with firms which often include conditions, such as requiring a minimum amount of order
flow per month before payments begin; different rates for low-priced securities; and graduated payments based on
dollar volume per month. Others argue that it would place an extreme burden on recipient broker-dealers to determine
that amount of order flow received for each order in time for a confirmation. Several commenters also argue that specific
disclosure would require broker-dealers to reprogram computer systems, perform tracking and report cash payments,
and that such expenses are disproportionately high in relation to the potential benefits to customers. Some commenters
recommend a generic disclosure statement which would eliminate the high cost of systems changes, yet still inform
the customer as to the receipt of payment for order flow. Another concern raised by opponents of the Commission's proposal
is that payment is given for an aggregation of orders directed to a particular market center and does not attach to a
particular order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to commenters' concerns, the Commission has modified the Rule to require a statement on order confirmations
that payment for order flow is received by the broker or dealer and that the source and nature of the payment for order
flow received in connection with the particular transaction will be furnished upon written request of the customer.
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission has determined to allow broker-dealers to conform the statement to the firm's practices, for instance,
specifically noting that it limits the receipt of payment for order flow to market orders only, if applicable. Because
the definition of payment for order flow includes non-monetary forms of payment for order flow, broker-dealers will
be expected to include those forms of compensation in preparing confirmations and to provide the nature and source
of the compensation upon written request. The Commission believes that the Rule, as modified, retains informative
disclosure to investors.
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission recognizes that information on the confirmation may not communicate all information of interest
to investors about payment for order flow or the quality of order execution. The role of the required disclosures on
the confirmation is more limited and is intended to inform customers about the existence of payment for order flow
practices and to confirm that which the customer, if interested, already should know about the broker's order handling
practices as a result of the new account and annual disclosure statements.

The Commission also solicited comment in the Proposing Release on alternative approaches to regulating the practice
of payment for order flow. The Commission invited commenters to address such alternatives as banning payment for
order flow and requiring the broker-dealers to pass payment for order flow through to their customers,
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 and directing securities markets to convert quotations to decimal-based pricing from the current one-eigth fractions.
The Commission, however, has determined that these approaches are not the appropriate regulatory response at this
time.

No commenters fully supported the alternative of passing payments through to customers. Three commenters, however,
oppose the alternative and argue that the economic advantages of order flow payments already benefit customers of
retail firms in the form of lower commission rates. Moreover, some argue compulsory remission of payments may be administratively
burdensome for brokers and difficult to enforce due to the difficulty in allocating direct payments for particular
orders.

A. Banning Payment for Order Flow
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission believes disclosure is the appropriate response to the issue raised by payment for order flow. The
Commission does not believe that all payment for order flow arrangements are against the customer's best interest
and must be banned per se 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as compromising a broker's duty to seek best execution of the customer's order.
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 For example, it is unclear what harm lurks in specialists' or market makers' payment for order flow practices if unpriced
orders are subject to a meaningful opportunity for price improvement, or if other benefits are provided to the customer
due to the dealer's ability to use the payments. Additionally, the disclosures required by the new Rule and Rule amendments
should mitigate concerns opponents may have that investors are unaware of a broker-dealer's order routing practices.

An outright ban at this time, moreover, would represent a radical change to the industry where the payment of cash or
its monetary equivalent has become widespread.
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, banning payment for order flow has associated workability problems.
<FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>
 If the practice of cash payment for order flow were banned, because it is only one of many forms of inducement for order
flow, the Commission has every reason to believe that an attendant increase in related ``soft'' inducements for order
flow or internalization of order flow would follow.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, it would be impractical to attempt to ban solely soft practices (everything except monetary payment for
order flow); such practices are difficult to monitor and industry participants would find alternative avenues for
accomplishing the same result. The Commission will continue to monitor developments and will consider additional
regulatory steps if necessary to ensure the protection of investors.

B. Decimal Pricing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also solicited comment on adopting a decimal-based system for the pricing and reporting of all securities
for which transactions are reported. Some commenters believe that payment for order flow is, in effect, a reduction
in the spread that a market maker charges for executing a pre-determined package of order flow. Under this view, if
the NBBO is 20 bid and 201/4 offered, these commenters view the payment of two cents a share for order flow as little more
than an indication that, in effect, a market maker is willing to buy at 20.02 and willing to sell at 20.23. Accordingly,
these commenters believe that if a decimal pricing system were adopted, market makers could more easily compete by
narrowing their displayed quotes, resulting in reduced incentive to pay for order flow. Others question whether
the availability of decimals would, in fact eliminate payment for order flow because market makers still only may
want to pay for certain types of orders (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a diverse group of small market orders) and, as a result, may not lower their published quotes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that decimal pricing is the logical next step for the markets to pursue to improve the transparency
of the markets and provide opportunities for narrower spreads.
<FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, as an interim measure, the Commission's staff called for the markets to move to pricing in 1/16ths in the near
future.
<FOOTCITE>48</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the Commission understands the markets have undertaken a study of the costs and benefits of changing
the current display mechanisms.
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission looks forward to the prompt completion of the SRO study and the ultimate implementation of revised
pricing procedures. While it is currently unclear how decimalization would affect payment for order flow practices,
the Commission will monitor the progress of such endeavors and is prepared to reconsider the Rules adopted today,
and even to rescind them if decimal pricing or other reforms render payment for order flow obsolete.

On June 22, 1994, the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce
held a hearing regarding decimal-based pricing and unlisted trading privileges. Panelists included: Richard Ketchum,
Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Office, NASD; Edward Kwalwasser, Executive Vice President for Regulation,
NYSE, Nicholas Giordano, President and Chief Executive Officer, Phlx; and Brandon Becker, Director, Division of
Market Regulation, SEC. Congressman Markey and the panelists discussed decimal pricing and moving to sixteenths
as an interim measure. Congressman Markey asked the self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') to undertake a joint
study, to be completed by January 1995, of the implications of moving to sixteenths (as well as decimal pricing) and
the costs and benefits associated with the move. All of the SRO panelists agreed to participate in the study.

V. Implementation Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is setting April 3, 1995 as the implementation date for both the amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and
Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3. Thus, for orders received or trades effected on or after April 3, 1995, all customer confirmation
statements must contain the new disclosures required by Rule 10b&hyph;10, as modified today. For all new accounts
opened on or after April 3, 1995, the disclosures required by Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 will be in effect. For existing accounts,
the disclosures required by Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 should be made to customers beginning with the first commercially
reasonable date after April 3, 1995, but in no event, later than April 3, 1996. For example, if a firm provides annual
disclosure statements in January of each year, the disclosures should be made beginning with the January 1996 account
statement. If the firm provides quarterly statements, the disclosures should be made beginning with the July 1995
account statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The April 3, 1995 date was selected to provide firms with four months to make the necessary systems and forms changes
to prepare for the implementation.

VI. Competition Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 23(a)(2) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>
 requires the Commission in adopting rules under the Act, to consider the anti-competitive effects of such rules,
if any, and to balance any impact against the regulatory benefits gained in terms of furthering the purposes of the
Act. The Commission believes the proposed Rules will enhance competition among brokers, dealers, and market centers,
consistent with the goals of Section 11A and 23(a) of the Act. Several commenters raised concerns that the Rules, as
proposed, would require substantial systems changes and therefore, would increase the costs of doing business which
would be passed on to customers. The Commission has modified the portion of proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii)(B)
requiring individualized confirmation disclosure of and the amounts of monetary payment for order flow received.
The Rule, as adopted, may eliminate the need for individualized disclosures and for the quantification of payment
for order flow. The Commission intends to evaluate these issues further in connection with its Companion Release
soliciting comment on amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2).
<FOOTCITE>51</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission has considered Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 in light of the standard cited
in Section 23(a)(2) and believes that adoption of the Rules, as modified, will not impose any burden on competition
not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

VII. Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7))iii) and 10b&hyph;10(e)
will provide relevant, uniform disclosure to customers regarding details of their order executions. It is the Commission's
view that the Rule and Rule amendments will enhance investor protection and further competition for retail orders
by enabling customers to evaluate better the markets to which their orders are routed. The Commission further believes
that broker-dealers can make the necessary systems and forms changes to comply with the Rules, as amended, with limited
resource and systems changes. The Commission recognizes, however, that the extent and nature of the modifications
depends upon the current capabilities of each firm. Nevertheless, the Commission recommends that, as necessary,
broker-dealers that need to make systems changes evaluate their progress as the implementation date approaches
and make adjustments as appropriate to ensure a smooth transition to the enhanced disclosure of payment for order
flow.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``FRFA'') regarding Rules 10b&hyph;10 and
11Ac1&hyph;3, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604. The FRFA notes the potential costs of operational and procedural changes
that may be necessary to comply with the Rule. A copy of the FRFA may be obtained by contacting Jill W. Ostergaard, Attorney,
Branch of the National Market System, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulations, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW. , Mail Stop 5&hyph;1, Washington, DC 20549.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to reduce reporting requirements
currently imposed on water-cooled nuclear power reactor, research and test reactor, and nuclear material licensees.
This action would reduce the regulatory burden on NRC licensees. The proposed rule would implement an NRC initiative
to review its current regulations with the intent to revise or eliminate duplicative or unnecessary reporting requirements.
The proposed amendments would: (1) Eliminate the current requirement for licensees to submit summary reports of
containment leakage rate tests to the NRC (10 CFR Part 50_Appendix J), but preserve the requirements in &sect;&sect;50.72
and 50.73 under which licensees currently report any instances of leakage exceeding authorized limits in the technical
specifications of the license; (2) revise 10 CFR 55.25 to refer licensees to a similar reporting requirement in 10
CFR 50.74(c) and require notification of operator incapacity only in case of permanent disability or illness; and
(3) eliminate the requirement for quarterly submittal of safeguards event logs presently contained in 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2)
and Appendix G to Part 73.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 7, 1994, the Executive Director for Operations (EDO) sent to the Commission SECY&hyph;94&hyph;003, ``Plan
for Implementing Regulatory Review Group Recommendations.'' The Commission approved these recommendations for
reducing regulatory burden on its licensees. This proposed rule is one of several rulemaking and other regulatory
actions that the NRC staff is developing to implement those recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the NRC staff review of the regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices were published on February 24, 1992 (57 FR 6299) and June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27394) that solicited the views of the
public, the nuclear power industry, and other interested parties regarding reduction of the regulatory burden and
reporting requirements. Comments were received in response to those notices. A summary of the comments received
that are pertinent to this action is included in this document.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed amendments would: (1) Eliminate the current requirement for licensees to submit summary reports
of containment leakage rate tests to the NRC (10 CFR Part 50&hyph;Appendix J), but preserve the requirements in &sect;&sect;50.72
and 50.73 under which licensees currently report any instances of leakage exceeding authorized limits in the technical
specifications of the license; (2) revise 10 CFR 55.25 to refer licensees to a similar reporting requirement in 10
CFR 50.74(c) and require notification of operator incapacity only in case of permanent disability or illness; and
(3) eliminate the requirement for quarterly submittal of safeguards event logs presently contained in 10 CFR 73.71(c)(2)
and Appendix G to Part 73.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these proposed reduction in reporting requirements were discussed in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notices published on February 24, 1992 (57 FR 6299) and June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27394), the public is again invited to submit
comments. Specifically, the NRC requests comments and supporting rationale on the appropriateness of eliminating
or consolidating these reporting requirements and whether the public health and safety will be adversely affected
by these changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Elimination of Reporting Requirements from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, currently requires all water-cooled nuclear power reactor licensees to conduct containment
leakage testing. The containment leakage tests demonstrate that the containment system meets all the leakage criteria
specified in the technical specifications of the licenses. Currently, Section V.B. of Appendix J requires licensees
to submit a summary report of the results of all leak rate tests and any associated corrective actions. Under this proposed
rulemaking, licensees of water-cooled nuclear power reactors will continue to conduct containment leakage testing
and to prepare the summary report. However, they would not be required to submit the summary report to the NRC. They
would still be required to report to the NRC instances of leakage in excess of authorized limits, via a written licensee
event report,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as now required by &sect;50.73(a)(2)(ii). If such a leakage condition is found during operation, an immediate notification
by telephone is required by &sect;50.72(b)(1)(ii). If the leakage condition is found during shutdown the telephone
notification is required by &sect;50.72(b)(2)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These reports would be required when total containment as-found, minimum pathway leak rate exceeds the limiting
condition for operation (LCO) in the facility's technical specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC believes that the elimination of the requirement to submit the summary report to the NRC of leakage tests when
these results are within acceptance limits would have no impact on the overall health and safety of the public. Because
these tests have been performed and evaluated frequently by the nuclear power industry, any misinterpretation of
testing requirements is highly unlikely. Moreover, licensees would still be required to prepare the summary reports
and make those reports available for review and inspection at the respective plant sites. Having these reports available
at the plant sites should be sufficient for normal record reviews, and for any necessary in-depth reviews. Therefore,
the NRC proposes to eliminate the requirement to report results of tests within specified limits.

Consolidation of 10 CFR 50.74 and 10 CFR 55.25 Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an operator licensed pursuant to 10 CFR 55, becomes ill or disabled to the point that he or she no longer can safely
perform their duties, the reactor licensee is required to report the occurrence of disability under both 10 CFR 50.74(c)
and 10 CFR 55.25. The NRC is proposing to require only a single report by eliminating the reporting requirements in
10 CFR 55.25 and modifying 10 CFR 55.25 to refer facility licensees to 10 CFR 50.74(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, when 10 CFR Part 55 was promulgated, the intent of &sect;55.25 was to receive reports only of permanent
or potentially permanent illness or disability of licensed operators that would prevent them from safely carrying
out their responsibilities. However, this intent, is not explicitly stated in either &sect;55.25 or &sect;50.74(c).
To remove this ambiguity, the word ``permanent'' is added in both &sect;&sect;50.74(c) and 55.25. (A more detailed
discussion on ``permanent'' versus ``temporary,'' illness, or disability can be found in the NRC publication NUREG&hyph;1262,

Public Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only two comments were received concerning the reporting requirements for power reactor licensees. Neither suggested
elimination of any power reactor reporting requirement. However, both suggested that the redundant requirements
of 10 CFR Parts 50 and 55 addressing illness or disability of licensed operator be consolidated in 10 CFR 50.74.

10 CFR Part 73.71(c)(1) requires that licensees maintain a current log for recording safeguards events. An event
that must be recorded in the log is defined in Appendix G, Part 73 as ``Any failure, degradation, or discovered vulnerability
in a safeguard system. *&blank;*&blank;*.''

The full definition in 10 CFR Part 73, Appendix G, Section II is: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any failure, degradation, or discovered vulnerability in a safeguard system that could have allowed unauthorized
or undetected access to a protected area, material access area, controlled access area, vital area, or transport
had compensatory measures not been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any other threatened, attempted, or committed act not previously defined in Appendix G with the potential for
reducing the effectiveness of the safeguard system below that committed to in a licensed physical security or contingency
plan or the actual condition of such reduction in effectiveness.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC proposes to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit copies of the safeguard event logs. Until recently,
the NRC staff published an annual report which contained trending analysis of log events. However, the NRC now believes
that the greatest benefits of dissemination of these statistics on safeguards equipment performance and lessons
learned about the causes and prevention of safeguards equipment malfunctions have been realized, and that continuing
to publish that report is no longer cost effective. However, licensees will still be required to enter events in the
logs, and make those logs available for review and inspection at the respective plant sites. Having the logs available
at the plant site should be sufficient for normal record reviews, and any necessary in-depth reviews. Therefore,
the NRC believes that public health and safety will not be adversely affected if the logs are no longer submitted to
the NRC.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The former Nuclear Management and Resources Council, now known as the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), commented
that power reactor licensees should be deleted from the list of licensees subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 73.71(c).
According to NEI, comparisons among plants using the data provided in the logs are not meaningful because the number
of events reported by each site is dramatically influenced by a number of site-specific variables such as the number
and design of system components and unique physical arrangements. NEI stated that comments received from industry
were almost unanimous in advising that licensees receive insignificant information from the NRC's quarterly ``Safeguards
Events Analysis Report.'' NEI further commented that the real benefit in recording safeguards events lies in its
usefulness as a management tool to measure a plant's specific performance, independent of other facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One licensee commented that if the requirement to submit a log to the NRC were not deleted, the frequency of submittal
should be reduced from 4 times each year to 2 times each year as required for submittal of fitness-for-duty performance
data in 10 CFR 26.71(d). The licensee noted that timeliness would not be adversely impacted in a significant way by
annual or semiannual rather than quarterly reporting. The licensee also suggested that evaluation of trends is more
meaningful when based on events over 6 months or a year rather than only 3 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC believes that, in the early years of this program, there was considerable benefit from comparisons of the performance
of a site's security equipment with the performance of the rest of the industry, notwithstanding differences in site-specific
variables. However, the NRC now believes that the greatest benefits have been realized and that continuing the program
as a regulatory tool has a diminishing cost benefit. As such, the NRC agrees with the comments that the primary benefit
in logging events is the usefulness of the log as a means for the licensees to track and trend the performance of the safeguards
systems at their own plants. In fact, the NRC has already discontinued publication of the ``Safeguards Events Analysis
Report.'' Although the NRC is proposing to eliminate the requirement that licensees submit their safeguards event
logs, licensees would still be required to enter events into their logs and maintain those logs on site for review by
the NRC inspectors.

prepared for this regulation.

Paperwork Reduction Act Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule amends information collection requirements that are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of
1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval of the paperwork requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule will relax existing information collection requirements, the public burden for this collection
of information is expected to be reduced by approximately 10 hours per licensee. This reduction includes the time
required for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed
and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding the estimated burden reduction
or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Information
and Records Management Branch (T&hyph;6 F33), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001;
and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB&hyph;10202 (3150&hyph;0011, 3150&hyph;0018,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule
will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This proposed
rule affects the nuclear power reactors, research and test reactors, and some material licensees. The companies
and organizations that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities'' set forth
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act of the size standards established by the NRC (56 FR 56671; November 6, 1991).

Backfit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has determined that the backfit rule 10 CFR 50.109, does not apply to this proposed rule because these amendments
do not involve any provisions which would impose backfits on licensees as defined in &sect;50.109(a)(1). Information
collection and reporting requirements are not subject to the backfit rule; moreover, the changes proposed in this
rulemaking relax existing requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Containment inspection in accordance with V. A. shall be performed as a prerequisite to the performance of Type
A tests. During the period between the initiation of the containment inspection and the performance of the Type A test,
no repairs or adjustments shall be made so that the containment can be tested in as close to the ``as is'' condition as
practical. During the period between the completion of one Type A test and the initiation of the containment inspection
for the subsequent Type A test, repairs or adjustments shall be made to components whose leakage exceeds that specified
in the technical specification as soon as practical after identification. If during a Type A test, including the supplemental
test specified in III.A.3.(b), potentially excessive leakage paths are identified which will interfere with satisfactory
completion of the test, or which result in the Type A test not meeting the acceptance criteria III.A.4.(b) or III.A.5.(b),
the Type A test shall be terminated and the leakage through such paths shall be measured using local leakage testing
methods. Repairs and/or adjustments to equipment shall be made and Type A test performed. The corrective action taken
and the change in leakage rate determined from the tests and overall integrated leakage determined from local leak
and Type A tests shall be included in the summary report required by V.B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Closure of containment isolation valves for the Type A test shall be accomplished by normal operation and without
any preliminary exercising or adjustments (e.g., no tightening of valve after closure by valve motor). Repairs of
maloperating or leaking valves shall be made as necessary. Information on any valve closure malfunction or valve
leakage that require corrective action before the test, shall be included in the summary report required by V.B.

(d) Those portions of the fluid systems that are part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary and are open directly
to the containment atmosphere under post-accident conditions and become an extension an extension of the boundary
of the containment shall be opened or vented to the containment atmosphere prior to and during the test. Portions of
closed systems inside containment that penetrate containment and rupture as a result of a loss of coolant accident
shall be vented to the containment atmosphere. All vented systems shall be drained of water or other fluids to the extent
necessary to assure exposure of the system containment isolation valves to containment air test pressure and to assure
they will be subjected to the post accident differential pressure. Systems that are required to maintain the plant
in a safe condition during the test shall be operable in their normal mode, and need not be vented. Systems that are normally
filled with water and operating under post-accident conditions, such as the containment heat removal system, need
not be vented. However, the containment isolation valves in the systems defined in III.A.1.(d) shall be tested in
accordance with III.C. The measured leakage rate from these tests shall be included in the summary required by V.B.

Type A, Type B, or Type C test, as applicable for the area affected by the modification. The measured leakage from this
test shall be included in the summary report required by V.B. The acceptance criteria of III.A.5.(b), III.B.3., or
III.C.3., as appropriate, shall be met. Minor modifications, replacements, or resealing of seal-welded doors,
performed directly prior to the conduct of a scheduled Type A test do not require a separate test.

A general inspection of the accessible interior and exterior surfaces of the containment structures and components
shall be performed prior to any Type A test to uncover any evidence of structural deterioration which may affect either
the containment structural integrity or leak-tightness. If there is evidence of structural deterioration, Type
A tests shall not be performed until corrective action is taken in accordance with repair procedures, non destructive
examinations, and tests as specified in the applicable code specified in &sect;50.55a at the commencement of repair
work. Such structural deterioration and corrective actions taken shall be included in the summary test report required

1. The preoperational and periodic tests must be documented in a readily available summary report that will be made
available for inspection, upon request, at the nuclear power plant. The summary report shall include a schematic
arrangement of the leakage rate measurement system, the instrumentation used, the supplemental test method, and
the test program selected as applicable to the preoperational test, and all the subsequent periodic tests. The report
shall contain an analysis and interpretation of the leakage rate test data for the Type A test results to the extent
necessary to demonstrate the acceptability of the containment's leakage rate in meeting acceptance criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For each periodic test, leakage test results from Type A, B, and C tests shall be included in the summary report. The
summary report shall contain an analysis and interpretation of the Type A test results and a summary analysis of periodic
Type B and Type C tests that were performed since the last type A test. Leakage test results from type A, B, and C tests
that failed to meet the acceptance criteria of III.A.5(b), III.B.3, and III.C.3, respectively, shall be included
in a separate accompanying summary report that includes an analysis and interpretation of the test data, the least
squares fit analysis of the test data, the instrumentation error analysis, and the structural conditions of the containment
or components, if any, which contributed to the failure in meeting the acceptance criteria. Results and analyses
of the supplemental verification test employed to demonstrate the validity of the leakage rate test measurements
shall also be included.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to supersede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airworthiness Directive 92&hyph;08&hyph;07, which currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires inspecting (one-time) the wing front spar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carry-through frame structure for cracks on certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beech 33, 35, and 36 series airplanes, and, if found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracked, repairing or reinforcing. The Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Administration (FAA) has received 43 reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wing front spar carry-through frame structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracks on the affected airplanes during the inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07. The proposed action would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make this one-time inspection repetitive. The actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe structural damage to the wing.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;8218 (57 FR 13004, April 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15, 1992), currently requires inspecting (one-time) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wing front spar carry-through frame structure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracks on certain Beech 33, 35, and 36 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, and, if found cracked, repairing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcing. These actions are accomplished in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Beech Service Bulletin (SB) No. 2360, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated November 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this AD became effective, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received 43 reports of wing front spar carry-through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frame structure cracks on Beech 33, 35, and 36 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes during the inspection required by AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07. Several of these affected airplanes had cracks

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between huckbolts that incur heavy loads and along the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radius of the carry-through web in critical primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airframe structure. These cracks, if not detected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, could result in wing front spar carry-through structure failure, which could result in severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural damage to the wing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After examining the circumstances and reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information related to the incidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above, the FAA has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection required by AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07 should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to exist or develop in other Beech 33, 35, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 36 airplanes of the same type design, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD would supersede AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07 with a new AD that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require repetitively inspecting the wing front spar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carry-through structure for cracks, and, if found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cracked, repairing or replacing. The proposed action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be accomplished in accordance with Beech SB No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2360, dated November 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 11,000 airplanes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would take approximately 8 workhours per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$4,840,000. This figure does not account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive inspections. The only difference between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost analysis for this proposed action and AD 92&hyph;08&hyph;07 (which would be superseded by this proposed
action) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the cost of these repetitive inspections. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has no way of determining the number of repetitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections an owner/operator may incur.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposed a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76B helicopters. That action would have limited the applicability of the inspections
of the left and right engine input drive shaft assemblies (shaft assemblies) for loose balance weights or cracks to
those shaft assemblies of original (or initial) design only, and would have excluded redesigned shaft assemblies
from those inspections. Since the issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has received a report of a fatigue crack in a redesigned
shaft assembly indicating a need to continue the existing inspections of the redesigned shaft assembly. Accordingly,
the proposed rule is withdrawn.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to supersede an existing airworthiness
directive (AD), applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;76B helicopters, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 2, 1992 (57 FR 49431). The proposed rule would have limited the applicability of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;02
by requiring initial and repetitive 25 hours time-in-service inspections of the shaft assemblies of original (or
initial) design only, excluding the redesigned shaft assemblies from the inspections. That action was prompted
by the introduction of a redesigned shaft assembly that was designed to eliminate the cause of cracks in the original
shaft assemblies. The proposed actions were intended to prevent failure of certain shaft assemblies and subsequent
loss of power to the helicopter rotor system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received a report of a fatigue crack in a redesigned shaft assembly. Therefore,
the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 93&hyph;1&hyph;05 on June 4, 1993, to require inspections of the redesigned shaft
assemblies at intervals not to exceed 6 hours time-in-service from the last inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon further consideration, the FAA has determined that the proposed rule to exclude redesigned shaft assemblies
from the AD inspections is no longer appropriate. Accordingly, the proposed rule is hereby withdrawn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Withdrawal of this notice of proposed rulemaking constitutes only such action, and does not preclude the agency from
issuing another notice in the future, nor does it commit the agency to any course of action in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action only withdraws a notice of proposed rulemaking, it is neither a proposed nor a final rule and therefore,
is not covered under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to determine proper adjustment of the gap tolerances
of the seat track joints at frame 64, and correction of discrepancies. This proposal would also require eventual repositioning
or replacing the seat tracks on all affected airplanes, which would terminate the requirement of repetitively removing
or repositioning the seat tracks. This proposal is prompted by in-service inspection reports, which have revealed
that a gap between the forward and aft seat track at frame 64 could exceed the tolerance limit due to a method used on the
assembly line to control the position of the seat track. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure
that the gap tolerances of the seat track joints do not exceed the tolerance limit and subsequently lead to separation
of the passenger seats from the seat track under emergency landing conditions.

Discussion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that in-service inspection reports have revealed that the gap between the forward and aft seat track at frame
64 (left- and right-hand) could be exceeding the 2.8 mm (.11 inch) tolerance limit. Investigation revealed that the
cause has been attributed to the method used on the assembly line to control the position of the seat track. This method
is inadequate in monitoring the gap between the forward and aft seat track of the passenger seats at frame 64. Incorrectly
installed seat tracks, if not corrected, could result in a gap that exceeds the tolerance limit, and could subsequently
lead to separation of the passenger seats from the seat track under emergency landing conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 53&hyph;01, dated August 27, 1992, which describes procedures for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Performing a one-time visual inspection to determine if a seat fitting having an x-plunger behind a z-stud is installed
at the seat track joint at frame 64;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Measuring the gap between the forward and aft seat tracks, if any seat fitting having an x-plunger is installed;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applying sealing material at the seat tracks, if the gap is less than or equal to 2.8 mm; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Removing or repositioning the seat, if the gap is greater than 2.8 mm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;53&hyph;1088, dated May 10, 1993, which describes procedures
for repositioning or replacing the seat tracks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DGAC classified the AOT and service bulletin as mandatory and issued French Airworthiness Directive 93&hyph;081&hyph;042(B),
dated May 26, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to determine if
a seat fitting having an x-plunger behind a z-stud is installed at the seat track joint at frame 64, and correction of
discrepancies. The proposed AD would also require repositioning or replacing the seat tracks, which would terminate
the requirement of repetitively removing or repositioning the seat tracks. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. If any cabin equipment other than passenger seats
is installed at frame 64, the correction would be required to be accomplished in accordance with a method approved
by the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 85 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.

It would take approximately 7 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed inspection at an average labor rate
is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the inspection proposed by this AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $32,725, or $385 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would take approximately 54 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed modification at an average labor
rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on
these figures, the total impact of the modification proposed by this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $252,450,
or $2,970. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on above figures, the total cost impact of the proposed inspection and modification on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $285,175, or $3,355/per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

Section 202(a) of the FPA reflects Congress' desire to promote and encourage the voluntary interconnection and coordination
of utility facilities. While the Department of Energy now has primary responsibility for Section 202(a) of the Federal
Power Act, see 42 U.S.C. 7151, 7172, all voluntary coordination and interconnection agreements involving public
utilities must be filed with the Commission. The Commission, therefore, continues to play a pivotal role in this area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 205(a) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) authorizes the Commission
to exempt electric utilities, in whole or in part, from state law, rule or regulation which prohibits or prevents voluntary
coordination. Under PURPA section 205(b)(2), the Commission also may recommend to electric utilities that they
enter into negotiations concerning pooling arrangements.

Since the inception of power pools, fundamental changes have occurred in the electric utility industry. Most significant
are the enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPAct)

 and the emerging development of a competitive bulk power market. The Commission has recently announced in a series
of orders its policy of promoting competitive bulk power markets, and has emphasized the critical role of comparable
transmission access in meeting that goal.

Given the ongoing changes in the competitive environment of the electric utility industry_in particular, the potential
for substantially increased access to transmission_we must consider whether we are appropriately balancing our
dual objectives of promoting coordination and competition. Indeed, industry participants in many regions are responding
to competitive changes by exploring the possibility of changes in, or alternatives to, traditional power pools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the new alternative power pooling institutions have great potential. In particular,
they may be of assistance in facilitating the resolution of some difficult federal-state jurisdictional issues
and in developing mechanisms for resolving or minimizing stranded cost issues. We therefore want to explore them
in detail. We are particularly interested in determining whether alternative power pooling institutions may have
special transmission pricing needs.

We also wish to re-examine the role of more traditional power pools in an era of increased competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we are initiating a notice of inquiry on alternative power pooling institutions. This notice has
three parts. First, we relate our understanding of an innovative power pooling concept proposed by two utilities
in Southern California in response to the California Public Utilities Commission's (California Commission) inquiry
into retail access (the ``Blue Book Proposal'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We also note our interest in any other alternative pooling institutions that are being explored today. Second, we
briefly describe power pools as they have evolved to date in order to provide a comparison of traditional power pools
with emerging, innovative proposals. Third, we ask interested parties to respond to specific questions, as well
as to provide us with any other comments they may have, on alternative power pooling institutions and existing power
pools.

We note that a major focus of this notice of inquiry is on power pooling to accomplish short-term transactions, rather
than long-term regional planning, which we addressed in our Policy Statement on Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While power pools do some transmission planning, it is not necessarily of a regional or long-term nature. In contrast,
as envisioned in our policy statement on RTGs, RTGs may be better able to focus on long-term and regional transmission
planning. In this sense, RTGs and poolcos, at a minimum, would be complementary, rather than competing, institutions.
Indeed, the same institution could perform both functions. For example, some RTGs may decide to develop mechanisms
to accommodate short-term transactions within the RTG. The Commission is interested in exploring whether RTGs would
be appropriate institutions to accommodate power pooling.

II. Alternative Power Pooling Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Increased competition in the electric utility industry may signal the need for alternative power pooling arrangements.
We are interested in considering new arrangements that could better capture the benefits of competition in bulk power
markets without unnecessarily sacrificing coordination benefits. Serious discussion is occurring in California
at the present time concerning an alternative power pooling arrangement.

A. The Poolco Concept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two utilities (San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company) have each proposed creating
a regional pooling company, or ``poolco,'' in response to the California Commission's Blue Book Proposal. Both proposals
discuss some form of restructuring, either vertical disintegration or the relinquishment of transmission control.
Divestiture has not been proposed. However, the utilities may intend to create subsidiary companies for each function
that would remain affiliated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the two proposals vary in some details, they share many fundamental characteristics. Basically, the poolco
would be an independent entity that would not own any (or would own only a limited number of) facilities, but would control
the operation of some or all generators, and all transmission facilities, in a region. The poolco would be open to all
generators connected to the grid, who would automatically receive any transmission service needed to sell power
into the regional pool. In effect, the poolco would be responsible for creating and maintaining a regional spot market
for electricity. The spot price in each trading period (perhaps hour-by-hour) would be readily available and made
known to all market participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generating resources would be centrally dispatched on an hourly basis by the poolco in much the same way as in current
power pools. The principal difference appears to be that generators would be dispatched based on the bid price they
submit to the poolco, rather than on their running costs. The poolco would operate a least-cost (in the sense of lowest
bid) dispatch that accounts for any transmission constraints in the same manner as an existing power pool or a single
utility dispatch center. Generators would be paid the market-clearing price
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 during each hour, as opposed to the bid price that each generator submitted to the poolco.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Likewise, distributors would pay the market-clearing price in each hour. Consequently, the poolco would break even
in its basic dispatch function, since distributors would pay to the poolco what the generators would receive from
the poolco.

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The market-clearing price is the highest bid price of any generator that is selected to provide service to the poolco
in an hour. Each successful bidder would receive this price, regardless of whether its bid price was less than the market-clearing
price.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This method of pricing creates an incentive for each generator to bid near its marginal running cost, since it would
risk losses if it bids less than its running costs and the poolco selects it to run, and it would risk losses if it bids
more than its running costs and the poolco does not select it to run. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In effect, the poolco would become the market clearinghouse for the hourly energy market. Under the poolco concept,
dispatch benefits are implicitly allocated among sellers and buyers by the spot trading at a market-clearing price.
The poolco would have no further role in dividing or allocating benefits. Also, the proposed poolco would have no role
in long-term energy or capacity markets. Generators and distributors could enter into contracts outside the poolco.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under San Diego's poolco concept as currently proposed,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 spot prices would vary from one geographical location to another to reflect transmission constraints.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 This would allow the spot trading to be conducted at a price that reflects the real ability and limitations of the grid
to move power from low-cost to high-cost areas. The proposal includes opportunity cost pricing for grid congestion,
as well as tradable capacity rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the poolco concept contains many similarities to existing power pools, it appears that significant differences
exist between a traditional power pool and a poolco, particularly with respect to both generation and transmission
pricing. Although a traditional power pool generally has flexible cost-based pricing schemes,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 we understand that a fundamental characteristic of the California poolco concept is that all short-term power sales
would occur at a market-clearing price. In other words, whereas in a traditional power pool the offer-price mechanisms
are cost-based, in the California poolco proposal they would be based on economic bids with an incentive to bid at or
near the utility's marginal running costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These range from split-savings (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection (PJM)) to a rate that falls under a price cap based on pool members'
composite costs (Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another difference between traditional power pools and the California poolco proposals is their membership. Today,
some power pool agreements include explicit membership criteria. Most include no explicit provisions addressing
the admission of new members. However, most existing pools to some extent limit membership. On the other hand, the
California poolco proposals, as we understand them, would require open membership for at least all bulk power participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California poolco proposals represent an interesting alternative approach to achieving operating efficiency
and competition in hourly electricity markets. However, the proposals are in an early stage of development and a number
of significant transmission issues apparently have not yet been resolved (for example, how transmission owners
would be compensated for the existing facilities, how to determine priorities for use of the transmission grid, how
to allocate expansion costs and how to induce appropriate expansion). Since the California poolco proposals raise
several questions and issues that need additional consideration, we have included a list of questions in section
III.C of this Notice on which we seek comments from interested persons.

B. Other Alternative Power Pooling Institutions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There may be other alternative pooling proposals of which the Commission is not aware. The above discussion is not
intended to limit the scope of this inquiry. The Commission is interested in all innovative pooling proposals intended
to capture the benefits of competitive bulk power markets while preserving those coordination benefits that are
consistent with competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of alternative power pooling arrangements, and the California poolco proposal in particular, is part of
a larger discussion concerning the future structure of the electric power industry in the United States. In addition
to the California poolco concept, other innovative institutions have been proposed which, as the Commission comprehends
them, might either work in tandem with a poolco, or separately from a poolco to facilitate the development of a more
competitive bulk power market. For example, some have suggested that the electric power industry could be restructured
to include: (1) generating companies, known as ``gencos,'' which are groupings of generators that may or may not be
affiliated with utilities that compete to sell electricity in the wholesale spot and contract markets; (2) transmitters,
known as ``transcos'' or ``gridcos,'' which are companies that would separately own and maintain a regional transmission
grid; and (3) distributors, known as ``discos,'' which are utilities that would operate the local distribution systems
and purchase energy in the competitive wholesale market for resale to ultimate customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In such a restructured market, the poolco could be a fourth player that could control the operation of the generation
and transmission facilities owned by gencos and gridcos; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the poolco could dispatch the system based on buy/sell offers from individual gencos and discos. In addition, the
poolco could provide any necessary ancillary services (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, load following, spinning reserves, and reactive power) at cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to proposals to restructure the electric power industry along functional lines, there may be other alternative
institutional structures for the industry that warrant consideration in this inquiry. The Commission is interested
in expanding its appreciation of any such proposals for alternative institutional structures. In particular, the
Commission is interested in the extent to which such alternative institutional structures might facilitate the
achievement of a more competitive bulk power market in a way that the current institutional structure of the industry
may not. We have included several questions in this regard as part of section IV. of this notice.

III. Existing Power Pools

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to fully understand the issues presented by alternative power pooling institutions, it is necessary to understand
existing power pools. In addition, given the competitive changes in the industry and the fact that new pooling alternatives
are emerging, it is appropriate to consider whether existing power pools are functioning appropriately and, if not,
to consider what changes are necessary.

Historically, utilities began coordination activities by entering into simple bilateral arrangements, progressing
gradually to more complex contractual agreements. Such agreements may simply cover an exchange of energy and power,
or they may cover a variety of services. They generally are not considered to be pooling agreements unless they include
coordination of reserve generating capacity and, in most cases, some coordination of planning and construction
in addition to operating coordination.

Although the terms ``pooling'' and ``coordination'' are sometimes used interchangeably, generally, the term ``coordination''
refers to the whole spectrum of relationships between utilities, and ``pooling'' refers to more formalized agreements
between utilities to operate and plan their systems in a manner that achieves the greatest regional economy and reliability.

Traditional power pools have provided to their members significant economic benefits and operating efficiencies,
including: reduced operating costs resulting from joint dispatch; reduced fixed costs resulting from joint construction
of generating units and reserve sharing; and increased system reliability resulting from reserve sharing and regional
planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing pools vary a great deal in the extent to which they are integrated, i.e., to which they plan and operate their
individual systems as a single system.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The most highly integrated pools are referred to as ``tight'' pools.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Tight pools extensively coordinate their planning and operations in both the long and short run, and in theory provide
the greatest benefits. They provide for joint planning on a highly coordinated basis and for centralized dispatch
of generating facilities. They also establish contractual requirements with respect to generating capacity and
operating reserves, together with financial penalties to enforce reserve requirements.

Other pooling arrangements may coordinate extensively, but only involve a few companies, e.g., the coordination
arrangement between Detroit Edison Company and Consumers Power Company. Some coordination arrangements often
referred to as power pools are, in fact, simply vehicles for bilateral trades of economy energy, such as Western Systems
Power Pool (WSPP) and Florida Energy Broker.

There are three tight power pools operating today. NEPOOL operates in six New England states, and its 90 members include
investor-owned utilities (IOUs) and publicly-owned utilities. The New York Power Pool (NYPP) operates in the State
of New York, and its members include the seven IOUs in the State and the Power Authority of the State of New York. PJM operates
in the Mid-Atlantic region, and its eight members include only IOUs.

There are also several affiliated utility systems (registered holding companies under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935) that operate as tight power pools. Southern Company, Entergy Corporation, American Electric
Power Company, Allegheny Power System, Central &amp; South West Corporation, General Public Utilities (which is
itself a member of PJM), and Northeast Utilities (which is itself a member of NEPOOL). Together, these affiliated
utility systems and tight pools account for approximately 40 percent of the generating capacity in the Eastern Interconnection.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the key characteristics of a tight power pool is central dispatch, which ensures short-term efficiency by dispatching
the pool's combined generating resources to meet the pool's combined loads, without regard to unit ownership. The
benefits of central dispatch (i.e., the savings realized by dispatching jointly rather than individually) are shared
among pool members.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Even when pool members undertake bilateral trades with other pool members to increase their revenues from pool interchange,
the pool dispatch is unaffected. The bilateral agreement is simply a mechanism for adjusting the pool's after-the-fact
benefit sharing formula. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A long-term benefit of a tight power pool is joint action to enhance reliability. A tight pool coordinates maintenance
to ensure that adequate reserves are maintained, that is, units are taken out of service on a staggered basis. Also,
tight pools undertake some regional planning of production and transmission to facilitate joint solutions to regional
needs and problems. Finally, tight pools conduct transactions with neighboring pools to realize additional economy
savings and to increase reliability whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tight power pools generally require that members provide transmission access to other members without a direct charge
for economy trades effected through central dispatch as compensation for use of their facilities. However, the transmission
providers may be assigned a share of the savings resulting from the central dispatch. Affiliated power pools, i.e.,
the registered holding companies, have more extensive transmission access provisions that generally include some
form of transmission equalization payments among members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pools that are characterized by a lower level of coordination are called ``loose pools.'' 
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 For example, while the participating utilities work together to establish principles and practices for interconnected
operation, review area power supply problems and establish criteria for power supply adequacy, exchange generation
and transmission construction plans, and plan coordinated efforts to attain optimal economy and reliability, there
is no central dispatch and there may be less joint planning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in section IV of this Notice, the Commission seeks comment on a number of questions pertaining to existing
power pools (both tight pools and loose pools), and their strengths and weaknesses in light of emerging competitive
bulk power markets.

IV. Request for Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to assess the merits of alternative power pooling institutions, including the California poolco proposals,
and to evaluate whether our existing policies will impede the development of such institutions, the Commission seeks
comments from interested industry participants. We also believe that this proceeding is an appropriate forum to
consider whether any changes should be made in our policies concerning existing power pools. Our intention is to ensure
that our policies, while continuing to maintain adequate and reliable service, are consistent with the development
of a competitive bulk power market. Answers to the questions below should refer to the number(s) of the specific question(s)
when possible. In addition, commenters may address any other matters related to these issues. We are interested in
all aspects of potential changes in, or alternatives to, existing power pools.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Question 1. What alternative power pooling institutions might be beneficial? What are the strengths and weaknesses
of these alternatives? What special transmission pricing needs, if any, would such alternative pooling institutions
have? What specific benefits would an alternative bring that are not available today? What specific benefits of existing
pools would be lost? What, if any, benefits would alternative power pooling institutions provide compared to bilateral
trading? How would alternative power pooling institutions differ from a regime of bilateral trading? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 2. Do any current Commission policies impede the formation of beneficial alternative power pooling institutions?
What changes in our existing policies, if any, including pricing policies, are needed to encourage pools that facilitate
competitive bulk power markets? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 3. In discussing any alternative power pooling institution, please address how the adequacy of generation
and transmission services would be ensured, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 maintenance of adequate generation and transmission reserves and construction of needed generating and transmission
capacity? How would reliability be ensured, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, control of transmission systems, voltage support, reactive power, loop flow, load following, backup services
and other control area services? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 4. What are the conditions required for alternative power pooling institutions to be beneficial, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, a minimum number of sellers or buyers, a minimum geographic size, maximum market share for any seller or buyer, open
membership, appropriate governance rules? Should participation by generators in the alternative pool's area be
voluntary or mandatory? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 5. Do alternative power pooling institutions have the potential to help resolve or minimize stranded cost
issues? If so, how? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 6. How would specific alternative power pooling institutions be regulated? In particular, can these institutions
be designed to fit easily into the existing Federal-State regulatory structure so as to avoid duplicating the regulation
of pool functions? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 7. What are the merits of proposals to restructure the electric power industry along functional lines such
as the genco-gridco-disco delineation? Should the Commission be prepared to proceed with poolco-type proposals
in advance of any functional utility restructuring efforts, or should the Commission refuse to act on poolco-type
proposals unless the functional restructuring occurs simultaneously? Does such a restructuring have merit even
if an alternative power pooling arrangement is not adopted? Would such a restructuring facilitate the development
of a more competitive bulk power market in a way that the current institutional structure of the electric power industry
cannot?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Question 8. In addition to the proposal mentioned in the preceding question, are there other alternative institutional
structures for the electric power industry that warrant the Commission's consideration in this Inquiry?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 9. What are the strengths and weaknesses of today's power pools? We are particularly interested in concrete
examples related to existing power pools. Should the Commission consider changing any existing power pool practices
or policies to facilitate competitive bulk power markets?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 10. Would changes to existing power pools be preferable to creating new pooling institutions? Is an RTG an
appropriate institution to become a power pool? Or should the RTG's transmission planning function be kept separate
from the pool's generation market-clearing function?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 11. Can a pool provide advantages to its members without unduly preferring members to non-members? How should
pool members relate to non-members in an open access market? Are any improvements in information availability necessary
for existing pools or alternative pooling institutions to be more beneficial? What reciprocity conditions are appropriate
between pool members and non-members? How would a state policy of retail access affect pool membership conditions
and reciprocity obligations? What if retail access were available in only some states in the pool?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 12. How should the Commission's recently-announced policy concerning comparability of transmission
services be implemented with respect to alternative power pooling institutions and/or existing power pools?

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would establish uniform procedures under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act)
for the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to decertify persons who have been designated as MSHA-approved
instructors and those individuals certified or qualified to perform certain mining related tasks under the applicable
training, safety and health regulations. These proposed decertification procedures would also apply to those persons
who are deemed certified by MSHA as a result of their certification through State programs recognized by the agency.
The proposal would provide notice of potential decertification by MSHA and would provide procedural due process,
including a notice of proposed action, an informational meeting with the district manager, notice of the district
manager's decision, appeal rights to the appropriate administrator, and a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In order to maintain safe and healthful working conditions in mines, MSHA recognizes that certain tasks and duties
must be performed by individuals with the proper knowledge and expertise. MSHA has promulgated regulations in Title
30 of the Code of Federal Regulations (30 CFR), parts 48, 70, 71, 75, 77, and 90, that require particular activities
to be performed by persons who have demonstrated their expertise or proficiency to the agency or to a State mining agency,
who have been recognized as competent through training, testing or experience, and who have been formally ``approved,''
``certified,'' or ``qualified'' by MSHA or a State to perform these activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
MSHA regulations require some form of approval, certification, or qualification for a variety of activities. At
coal mines, certification requirements apply to underground coal mine foremen, assistant foremen, and preshift
examiners who, among other things, must be able to check for evidence of methane gas and identify other safety hazards.
Individuals who collect respirable dust samples, maintain and calibrate dust sampling equipment, test noise levels,
or examine surface coal mine work areas for hazardous conditions must also be certified by MSHA. Regulations for coal
mines also require the qualification of persons who perform electrical work, examine impoundment structures, test
methane and oxygen levels, operate hoists, or use explosives. Finally, MSHA approves instructors to provide training
to coal, metal and nonmetal miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Depending upon the type of approval, certification or qualification sought, an individual can become certified
or qualified through an MSHA-administered program, or a State-administered program recognized by MSHA. Six activities
require an approval, certification or qualification issued solely by MSHA: Respirable dust sampling; maintenance
and calibration of respirable dust sampling equipment; noise level testing; examination of impoundments; electrical
work (several States have electrical qualification programs approved by MSHA); and the training and retraining
of miners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA certifies and qualifies individuals to perform work in the remaining job categories, but also recognizes State
certifications for the following: blasters; foremen; assistant foremen; preshift examiners; persons who conduct
surface examinations; gas testers, and hoist operators. Because MSHA accepts State certifications for these job
categories, the agency does not require an MSHA-issued certification except where there is no State certification
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification and qualification procedures require an individual to show the necessary competency in the appropriate
areas. In general, an individual obtains an MSHA certification or qualification by attending an MSHA-sponsored
or approved training program; by demonstrating the ability to perform the activities and duties stated in the regulations;
or by successfully passing an examination. MSHA currently administers examinations for certification or qualification
for dust sampling, noise level testing, maintenance and calibration of dust sampling equipment, electrical work,
and examination of impoundments. In order to remain qualified to perform electrical work, the qualified person must
satisfactorily complete an MSHA-approved coal mine electrical retraining program annually. All other certifications
or qualifications have an indefinite duration requiring no recertification, except for those persons referred
to in &sect;75.100(c)(2) and 77.100(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most State certifications are conditional upon minimum age and years of mining experience, undergoing required
training, and passing a relevant examination. In many instances, States also require refresher training at specified
intervals. The following coal-producing States have one or more certification programs: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming. These States do not all maintain the same number and types
of certification programs, nor does MSHA recognize all State certifications. For instance, all of these States,
with the exception of Alaska, maintain programs for the certification of responsible individuals. MSHA recognizes
all of these types of certifications. On the other hand, although Arkansas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania have electrical
certification programs, MSHA does not recognize their State electrical certifications for compliance with Federal
regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, 30 CFR part 48 specifies procedures for revocation of the approval of part 48 training instructors. Under
30 CFR 48.3(i) and 48.23(i), a person's approval to conduct training under part 48 can be revoked for good cause which
may include failure to instruct a course within a 24-month period. It may also include failure to follow the approved
training plan, inadequate teaching skills, or lack of subject matter knowledge. This proposed rule would revise
and expand part 48 procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would also for the first time establish formal procedures for the revocation of the certifications
or qualifications of individuals as well as the termination of MSHA's acceptance of an individual's State certification
or qualification. Although an individual may continue to hold a State certification, MSHA could discontinue its
recognition or acceptance of the State certification by following the procedures in this part. Revisions to the applicable
sections of 30 CFR parts 70, 71, 75, 77 and 90 are included within the proposed rule. MSHA anticipates extensive coordination
with the States regarding pursuit of decertification actions within those States whose certifications MSHA recognizes.
MSHA will be cognizant of any State decertification actions, initiated independently of those actions specifically
referred or sought by MSHA, prior to the initiation of decertification actions by MSHA under this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA has reviewed the existing certification and qualification programs (and their attendant policies and procedures)
administered by MSHA and the States. MSHA has concluded that decertification procedures are necessary to assure
that specific activities are conducted only by persons who do so in compliance with the applicable regulations, or
who are competently fulfilling their work responsibilities. The agency has previously taken decertification action
against certain individuals on a limited basis. MSHA has determined that formalizing the process and standardizing
the procedures would assure that adequate notice is provided and sufficient due process is afforded to affected individuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA has also re-examined the proposed decertification process specifically applied to qualified diesel mechanics
and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1989, (54 FR 40996) as part of its comprehensive proposal for the approval and use of diesel equipment
in underground coal mines. Because of the generic nature of the procedures published and proposed today, the agency
does not believe that it is necessary to have a separate procedure for qualified diesel mechanics. This procedure
was published under proposed &sect;75.1916(h) (54 FR 40996). Consequently, today's proposal also contains a new
paragraph to amend proposed &sect;75.1915 which will serve to apply today's proposed part 42 to any qualification
requirements for diesel mechanics which become a final rule. It is MSHA's intent to delete any reference to the decertification
procedures referred to in proposed &sect;75.1916(h) when that regulation becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the assessment of civil penalties and the initiation of criminal action against operators or agents under
110 of the Mine Act do serve as effective enforcement measures, they may not, in all instances, induce necessary compliance
with regulations. MSHA believes that the emphasis in the certification and qualification programs should be on maintaining
the integrity of the certifications and the qualifications that are granted by ensuring that only those individuals
who adequately discharge the obligations which a certification requires continue to hold such certification. The
status of being certified or qualified is a privilege, not a right, and only those who carry out the responsibilities
that are inherent in these credentials should be permitted to hold them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Uniform decertification procedures would provide another approach for MSHA to direct a change in the actions and
attitudes of certified and qualified persons who do not comply with health and safety regulations. Temporary or permanent
decertification should compel compliance with the law, as decertification could adversely affect that person's
livelihood, and in the most severe instances, result in loss of employment. This proposed rule will encourage certified
and qualified persons to maintain their level of competence and follow required procedures, by establishing appropriate
remedial measures when MSHA identifies a certified or qualified person or an approved instructor who is not fulfilling
his or her responsibilities, either deliberately or as the result of accident, oversight, or lack of training. MSHA
believes that establishing uniform decertification procedures will ensure that certified and qualified persons
fulfill their responsibilities with due regard for compliance with safety and health standards.

III. Discussion of Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42.1&blank;Purpose and Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This part would establish the criteria and procedures for revocation of the authority given to persons to perform
certain tasks that must be done by a certified or qualified person, or an approved instructor. In general, temporary
or permanent decertification would be directed toward individuals who either repeatedly exhibit clear disregard
for compliance with training, health or safety standards or other relevant regulations, or who commit a particular
offense that is evidence of a serious disregard for the health and safety of miners affected by their activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When evidence indicates that a certified person does not adhere to the required procedures that are necessary to fulfill
his or her certified or qualified duties, or has failed to adequately fulfill his or her work responsibilities, the
appropriate MSHA district manager would initiate the decertification process. During the course of the decertification
process, the district manager would determine if the certified person's actions are intentional or the result of
accident, oversight, or lack of training. Based upon the facts in each case, the district manager would decide the
appropriate deterrent or remedial measures to be taken, such as those described below. MSHA intends that the agency's
district managers would also be able to propose temporary or permanent decertification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issuance of warning letters, proposal of remedial measures or temporary or permanent decertifications are actions
intended to augment existing enforcement policies and procedures. When a certified person fails to adhere to required
procedures due to accident, oversight, or lack of training, the district manager would generally issue a warning
letter or propose remedial measures, such as additional training. If, after these initial measures are taken, the
certified or qualified person continues to disregard proper procedures, MSHA would pursue temporary or permanent
decertification.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Temporary or permanent decertification would be directed toward individuals who repeatedly exhibit disregard
for health and safety, and also in instances when a particular single offense is of such a serious nature that temporary
or permanent decertification should be pursued. In some cases, a section 110 investigation, resulting in either
the assessment of civil penalties against the certified person or the pursuit of criminal proceedings, will occur
concurrently with temporary or permanent decertification. However, in particularly egregious cases, the district
manager may propose temporary or permanent decertification before any section 110 investigation is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the district manager may choose to issue a warning letter, propose remedial action, or propose temporary
or permanent decertification prior to, or concurrent with, action taken as a result of a section 110 investigation
within the context of MSHA's current enforcement hierarchy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the district manager may use these actions in circumstances where civil penalties under section 110(c) of the
Mine Act are not applicable, for example, because the individual in question is not a corporate agent. Decertification
action would allow for actions against individuals in such cases that do not currently receive additional enforcement
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, while MSHA has authority to enter mine property but cannot cite an operator or contractor for refusal
to allow the agency's examination of dust sampling equipment that is not located on mine property, the district manager
may take action against the responsible certification holders by proposing temporary or permanent decertification
when the certification holders have violated the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA's current policy and procedures for revocation of approval to be a part 48 training instructor allow the instructor
to present evidence or witnesses to substantiate his or her position, either through a meeting or written submission
to MSHA. The person may appeal adverse actions to the appropriate MSHA administrator. MSHA believes that these same
procedures also would be appropriate for those persons who would be subject to decertification under this proposed
rule. To ensure equitable and uniform treatment in all decertification actions, the scope of this rulemaking would
include all activities for which MSHA issues certifications or qualifications, including the part 48 instructor
program. The proposed rule includes additional provisions for the issuance of warning letters and the person's right
to a post-decertification hearing before the Department of Labor's Office of Administrative Law Judges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed rule would address the withdrawal of MSHA's recognition of an individual's State certification
when circumstances warrant such action. MSHA believes that a single rule will afford the same level of due process
for all proposed temporary and permanent decertifications. Because MSHA recognizes many State certification programs,
cooperation between MSHA and State mining agencies is crucial to the success of any decertification program. Federal
and State mine safety and health programs are more effective when the two government bodies operate cooperatively.
In instances where the State confers upon an individual a certification which is recognized by MSHA, the agency would
inform the appropriate State agencies that it has determined that an individual's actions may warrant the temporary
or permanent decertification of the State-issued certification. In those States which have procedures to decertify
individuals, MSHA would work closely with the State to investigate the matter and provide assistance in determining
an appropriate course of action. In those cases where the State concludes that decertification is not appropriate
and decides to take only limited action or no further action, but MSHA continues to believe stringent action is necessary,
MSHA may decide to use the procedures outlined in this proposed rule to terminate MSHA's recognition of the individual's
State certification for purposes of compliance with Federal regulations. MSHA would therefore retain the right
to suspend or terminate its recognition of a person's State certification even if the State has chosen not to pursue
temporary or permanent decertification.

Section 42.2&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following definitions would apply in this part:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrator.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Administrator would mean MSHA's Administrator for Coal Mine Safety and Health or Administrator for Metal and Nonmetal
Mine Safety and Health, as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certified.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Certified would mean certified, qualified, or approved by MSHA, either directly or through a State program recognized
by MSHA, to perform tasks or duties for which this chapter requires such specific authority. Similarly, certification
would mean certification, qualification, or approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Decertify.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Decertify would mean to temporarily or permanently revoke a person's certification, qualification, or approval.
If MSHA recognizes a person's certification by a State, then decertify would mean that MSHA would no longer recognize
that person's State certification for purposes of compliance with this chapter. Decertification would mean temporary
or permanent revocation of a person's certification, qualification, or approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42.3&blank;Warning Letter
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;42.3 would provide that when the evidence indicates that a certified person has failed to follow the
tasks set by this chapter, or the person no longer satisfies the requirements for retention of certification, or a
certified person's conduct leads to or contributes to a violation of any training, safety or health standard, the
district manager may send a warning letter to that person by certified mail, return receipt requested. This section
would provide that the district manager may notify the certified person through the warning letter that his or her
conduct has been deficient without requiring any further action, or may require remedial measures to be undertaken
by the certified person. In short, the warning letter must specify the basis for the warning. In some instances, MSHA
may choose to forego the issuance of a warning letter and move directly to issue a notice of proposed action under &sect;42.4
of this part.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA believes that certain types of deficient conduct on the part of a certified person may not require remedial action
or would not require, or provide a sufficient basis for, the more severe sanctions of temporary or permanent decertification.
In those instances, a warning letter from the district manager to the certified person would be sufficient to put the
certified person on notice that his or her conduct in the performance of regulated duties was not commensurate with
that normally required of a certified individual. The district manager may also include in the letter a statement
that further deficient conduct may lead to decertification action by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;42.3(b)(2), the warning letter would also provide a vehicle for the Agency to require the certified
individual to take some remedial action in order to retain his or her status. In these instances, MSHA district managers
would specify what type of remedial action on the part of the certified person would be necessary to retain certification.
MSHA intends that it would also be able to take action, such as allowing the certified person to work only under supervision
or requiring retraining where the circumstances would warrant it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule in &sect;42.3(b)(3) would also give the certified person 15 days from receipt to respond to the warning
letter from the district manager or to initiate the required remedial action. MSHA foresees that some certified persons
may choose to ignore the warning letter from the district manager, or notify the district manager that they object
to the implementation of remedial action. If no response is forthcoming from the certified person, or the certified
person failed to perform the required remedial action, the district manager would have the option of sending a notice
of proposed action under proposed &sect;42.4 to initiate temporary or permanent decertification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42.4&blank;Notice of Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;42.4(a) would provide that when the evidence indicates that a certified person has not undertaken
remedial action required by the district manager or that the temporary or permanent decertification is warranted
because of the certified person's disregard of training, safety or health standards, or the certified person's conduct
has led to or contributed to a violation of training, safety or health standards, the district manager would notify
the certified person of the proposed action by a certified letter, return receipt requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice would contain sufficient information to apprise the person of the action being initiated against him or
her and the basis for the proposed action. Specifically, the notice would inform the certified person under proposed
&sect;42.4(a) (1) and (2) whether the district manager was proposing temporary or permanent decertification. Under
&sect;42.4(b) (1), (2), and (3) of the proposal, the notice would describe how the certified person failed to appropriately
discharge his or her responsibilities. This part of the notice would specifically describe the certified person's
conduct or actions giving rise to the decertification action. Under &sect;42.4(c), the notice also would give the
person 15 calendar days from the date of its receipt to submit information to or request an informational meeting with
the district manager to discuss the proposed action. The notice would inform the person that if he or she fails to respond
within 15 days, the administrative record of the matter would close and MSHA would temporarily or permanently decertify
the person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA intends that this notice would not replace the issuance of citations for violations of regulations, but rather
would supplement these normal enforcement actions and would serve as an additional measure to induce compliance.
MSHA anticipates that many cases could be resolved without proceeding to an informational meeting because the certified
person would respond to the notice, submit explanatory information to the district manager, or correct inadequate
performance to the district manager's satisfaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the notice of proposed action and the return receipt, in conjunction with documentary evidence such as inspectors'
notes or informational submissions, would remain on file in the district office and become a part of the administrative
record of the action under proposed &sect;42.5(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;42.4(c) would also allow the certified person to submit information in place of or in addition to an
informational meeting. When no informational meeting is requested, the certified person would be able to submit
relevant information to the district manager within 15 calendar days from the date the person received the notice
of proposed action. After this 15-day period, the administrative record would be closed.

Section 42.5&blank;Informational Meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 42.5 of the proposed rule would provide an opportunity for the certified person to present evidence or information
on his or her behalf to the district manager relevant to the circumstances which gave rise to the initiation of the decertification
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;42.5(a), if the certified person requests an informational meeting with the district manager
within 15 calendar days from the date of receipt of the warning letter, the district manager would be required to hold
such meeting within 15 calendar days of the certified person's request. MSHA intends that the certified person would
have the right to legal representation at this meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the meeting proposed under &sect;42.5(b), the Agency would provide the certified person with an opportunity
to present evidence or witnesses to support his or her position. In addition, this part of the proposed rule under &sect;42.5(b)
(1) through (6) would require the district manager to inform the certified person of the following at the informational
meeting: the deficiencies in performance, and how the certified person had failed to appropriately fulfill required
responsibilities; the proposed remedial action and the reasons for the action; the close of the administrative record
15 calendar days after the informational meeting date to allow for the submission of additional information; the
projected date of the district manager's final decision; and the certified person's right to appeal this decision
to the appropriate administrator under proposed &sect;42.6. MSHA anticipates that the district manager may also
send a letter requesting additional information which the district manager has determined is necessary to make a
decision in the case. Such a letter would set reasonable time limits for the certified person to respond with the requested
information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed record of the meeting would be required to be kept under proposed &sect;42.5(c). The record of the informational
meeting would be kept in a format agreed to by the parties, such as a tape-recorded transcription or detailed notes
kept by a designated individual, and would be made a part of the administrative record for the action.

Section 42.6&blank;Notice of District Manager's Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After an informational meeting, if requested, has been held, the district manager would proceed to issue a decision
on the proposed action issued under &sect;42.6. Proposed &sect;42.6 would provide guidance to the district manager
for the form and content of his or her decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;42.6(a) would set a time limitation for the district manager to act after the administrative record
closes in a decertification case, and would provide that the decision be based on a complete evaluation of the whole
administrative record. The district manager would have 30 days to issue a decision once the administrative record
closes. MSHA believes that the 30-day period is an appropriate amount of time for the district manager to carefully
review and consider all of the evidence, and to issue a written decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;42.6(a) (1), (2), and (3), the Agency's district managers would have the power to suspend a person's
certification for a finite period of time; permanently decertify the individual with no opportunity for reapplication;
or allow the district manager to take any other appropriate action such as requiring the individual to undergo additional
training or testing to retain his or her certification. This range of options would give the district manager authority
to address each case in a manner that would be tailored to the facts presented by each case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, while the Agency has recently permanently decertified seven people after criminal convictions stemming
from respirable dust fraud, 73 people have also been temporarily decertified for periods ranging from one to four
years for respirable dust fraud. Additionally, two training instructors have been permanently decertified and
one training instructor has been temporarily decertified for a three-year period. One person has been temporarily
decertified to perform noise surveys for a two-year period and two individuals have been permanently decertified
from performing noise surveys. One individual has been temporarily decertified as an approved electrical qualifications
instructor for a two-year period. The above pleas or convictions, and related decertification actions, were the
result of criminal charges for offenses ranging from the creation and/or submission of fraudulent respirable dust
samples and cards, noise surveys, and training certificates, through conspiracy, mail fraud and charges under the
Racketeer Influence Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the district manager determines that temporary decertification is appropriate under proposed &sect;42.6(a)(1),
MSHA contemplates that at the end of the suspension period the temporarily decertified person would not be automatically
certified but would make application as any other person to obtain certification. He or she would be required to fulfill
all procedural steps for certification, as well as any additional special conditions that the district manager might
have imposed when the certified person was temporarily decertified. For example, if a certified person was temporarily
decertified and allowed to reapply for certification pending the completion of certain training, the certified
person would need to demonstrate that the training had been completed prior to reapplying for certification. MSHA
has provided procedural guidance for recertification under proposed &sect;42.10 of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule under &sect;42.6(a)(2) would allow a district manager to order permanent decertification for
any person who had shown evidence of a significant disregard for the health or safety of miners. For example, the Agency
believes that egregious behavior, which may constitute a serious violation of safety and health regulations, exposes
miners to unsafe or unhealthy conditions, and presents a clear disregard for the safety or health of miners, would
warrant the sanction of permanent decertification. MSHA's aforementioned permanent decertifications to date
have focused on such demonstrated behavior. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule under &sect;42.6(b) (1) through (6) would require the administrative record to include certain
information. The content of the administrative record is important in that it would give the certified person a basis
for understanding the nature of the action being taken against him or her and would provide documentation of the evidence
underlying the action. In addition, the district manager would have the ability to review all the relevant facts and
information in the case before reaching a decision. This information would include the notes or transcript from any
informational meeting which was held, as well as other relevant evidence. MSHA believes that other relevant evidence
may include background information such as information on the mine or mines where the certified person worked; relevant
correspondence between the district manager and the certified person concerning the decertification action; any
relevant documentary evidence such as certification papers, or certification examinations; possible district
investigation reports on the actions of the certified person; and any witness statements which were made as part of
the informational meeting or submitted separately to the district manager. Within 30 calendar days after the close
of the administrative record, the district manager would review and evaluate all submissions to the record, and send
a written decision to the certified person informing him or her of the results of the district manager's review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;42.6(c) would require that the district manager's decision be in writing and include certain information.
The district manager's written decision would inform the certified person of the district manager's conclusions.
For example, the letter may state that the record contains information which refutes the allegations in the notice
of proposed action, and that the matter has been closed. The decision could contain a description of the remedial action
that the certified person must take in order to retain his or her certification. Finally, the decision could also serve
as a notice of temporary decertification, with time limits and conditions for re-certification, or as a notice of
permanent decertification, if such a result were warranted by the evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would require that the district manager's written decision detail the specific facts which provide
the basis for the decertification action, and include a clear and concise statement of the reasons for the decision
reached by the district manager. The proposed rule would also provide that the decision would contain notification
of the certified person's right to appeal any adverse decision to the administrator under &sect;42.6(c)(3). Section
42.6(c)(4) would also require that the district manager's decision contain a statement that the administrative
record is available for review at the MSHA district office, and that the certified person may obtain a copy upon request.
Because certain appeal rights may attach, MSHA is proposing under &sect;42.6(d) that the Agency would send the decision
by certified mail, return receipt requested. The decision would be effective 15 calendar days after receipt by the
certified person, unless it is appealed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;42.7 would allow a certified person to appeal an adverse decision of temporary or permanent decertification
or other remedial action ordered by the district manager to the appropriate MSHA Administrator for Coal Mine Safety
and Health or Metal/Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health. This appeal would be required to be submitted in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, proposed &sect;42.7(a) would allow a certified or qualified person to appeal, in writing, the decision
of the district manager to the appropriate MSHA administrator. The administrator must receive this appeal within
15 calendar days from the individual's receipt of the certified letter containing the district manager's decision
notice ordering remedial action, or temporary or permanent decertification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt of the written appeal, the administrator would send written acknowledgment of the appeal to the certified
person, including an acknowledgment of an automatic stay of the remedial action or temporary or permanent decertification.
The stay would remain in effect pending the outcome of the appeal under proposed &sect;42.7(b) (1) and (2), and would
allow a certified person to retain certification until the administrator reached a decision in the matter. MSHA believes
that an automatic stay would be appropriate because the matter would still be under consideration by the Agency. The
decision by the administrator would not be reached until after the administrator has had the opportunity to review
the record and make a decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;42.7(b)(3) of the proposal, the district office would be required to forward a copy of the administrative
record to the administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposal would allow the certified person to request a meeting with the administrator under proposed
&sect;42.7(b)(4). Such a meeting must be requested by the certified person within 15 days of the certified person's
receipt of the administrator's written acknowledgment of the appeal. When such a meeting is requested by the certified
person, MSHA intends that the administrator would be permitted to consider evidence in addition to that presented
to and considered by the district manager. MSHA intends that this subsection would allow the certified person to submit
relevant information to the administrator in lieu of a face-to-face meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;42.7(c) would provide the administrator with a time limit of 30 days to issue a written decision after
either his or her receipt of the administrative record and district manager's decision, or 30 days after his or her
meeting with the certified person. MSHA believes that this is a reasonable amount of time for the administrator to
review the evidence and issue a reasoned decision. In some instances, post-meeting submissions to the administrator
may extend the time to issue a written decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 42.7(c) (1) and (2) would provide that the administrator would have several possible options after his or
her evaluation of all of the evidence. The administrator could issue a decision that upholds the decision of the district
manager, and in such a case the remedial action or temporary or permanent decertification would become effective
30 days after receipt by the certified person except as provided in &sect;42.8(e). The administrator could also issue
a decision overturning the district manager's decision. Finally, the administrator may also refer the matter back
to the district manager with appropriate instructions, based on the receipt of new evidence or information that was
not available to, or considered by, the district manager at the time that his or her decision was rendered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;42.7(d) would require that the written decision contain a clear statement of the basis for the decision,
including specific references to the evidence contained in the record that was considered in arriving at the determination.
The written decision would be served upon the certified person by certified mail, return receipt requested.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the individual who is temporarily or permanently decertified may suffer a reduction in pay and possibly loss
of his or her livelihood, the issue of due process for such individuals is a central concern of this rulemaking. MSHA
is therefore committed to providing meaningful procedural safeguards at an appropriate level of due process.

, 408 U.S. 471 (1972). Thus, MSHA's multi-level review scheme within the Agency incorporating informal pre-decertification
proceedings such as a notice of charges, explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for the certified person
to present ``his side of the story'' should be sufficient to satisfy the test of ``what process is due'' when the informal
pre-decertification proceedings are followed by a full post-decertification evidentiary hearing.

, 470 U.S. 532 (1985). MSHA has carefully considered whether a certified person should get a formal pre-decertification
evidentiary hearing. At this point in the rulemaking process, MSHA believes that the procedural due process safeguards
proposed here are adequate under the requirements of the United States Constitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, MSHA believes that the potential harm to miner health and safety which may result from protracted pre-decertification
litigation is an issue which must be carefully considered. Therefore, under proposed &sect;42.8(a)(1), a person
whose temporary or permanent decertification has been upheld by the administrator may obtain a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 hearing before the Office of Administrative Law Judges, United States Department of Labor, by filing a request for
a hearing with the administrator within 30 calendar days after receipt of the administrator's decision. The administrator
would refer the request for hearing, along with the district manager's decision, and the administrator's decision
to the Office of Administrative Law Judges within 10 calendar days of receipt of the hearing request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The starting date of the temporary or permanent decertification would not be affected by the certified person's decision
to obtain a post-decertification hearing. The temporary or permanent decertification would be effective 30 days
after the certified person's receipt of the administrator's decision, except as provided in proposed &sect;42.8(e).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The request for a hearing under 42.8(a)(2) would include a summary of the issues involved and the specific objections
that the certified person has to the administrator's decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;42.8(c), the administrative law judge assigned to hear the case would expedite the hearing
of the case because of the possibility that temporary or permanent decertification may significantly impair the
certified person's livelihood. In addition to expediting the hearing, the administrative law judge would render
his or her final decision in the case within 45 days of the close of the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;42.8(d) would provide that decertification hearings before the Department of Labor Office of Administrative
Law Judges would be governed by the rules of practice and procedure for hearings before the Office of Administrative
Law Judges at 29 CFR part 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;42.8(e), a request for a stay would be filed within 30 calendar days after receipt of the administrator's
decision. The request for a stay would automatically stay the administrator's decision until the administrative
law judge could rule on the stay request. The automatic stay would allow the administrative law judge sufficient time
to obtain jurisdiction to rule on the request for a stay, and it would allow the status of the certified person to remain
unchanged until the stay request was decided by the administrative law judge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether to grant a stay, the proposal would require under &sect;42.8(f) that the administrative law
judge would be required to consider the certified person's likelihood of success on the merits, and the potential
harm to mine safety and health if the certified person were allowed to continue his or her work during the pendency of
the case before the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge would also be required to clearly state
the reasons for the granting or denial of a stay in any subsequent order concerning the granting or denial of the stay.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA envisions that a decision of the case rendered by an administrative law judge could then be appealed to the appropriate
United States Court of Appeals. In the Mine Act, the Congress established a scheme whereby judicial review of all record-based
Agency determinations is available only in the courts of appeal. After fully examining this statutory review scheme,
MSHA believes that all judicial review of Secretarial action under the Mine Act lies exclusively in the courts of appeal,
whether such review is specifically provided or whether the Mine Act is silent as to judicial review. See,

After a decision to temporarily or permanently decertify an individual becomes final, the district manager would
immediately notify, in writing, the mine operator or operators for whom the certified person performs such work that
he or she has been temporarily or permanently decertified. The district manager would also notify the appropriate
Coal Mine Safety and Health or Metal and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health Technical Compliance and Investigation Division
(TCID) and the Qualification and Certification Unit of MSHA. The TCID would notify other district offices of the temporary
or permanent decertification so that all districts would be aware of the change in status of the certified person.

Section 42.10&blank;Recertification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A person who has been temporarily decertified may apply for recertification by MSHA after the end of the temporary
decertification period. To obtain recertification, the person must fulfill the requirements for certification
or qualification as required under the applicable regulations before a new certification or qualification is issued.
In addition, if the district manager, administrator or administrative law judge imposed additional requirements
for recertification beyond the basic application, the certified person must also show that those requirements have
been fulfilled. MSHA intends that applications for recertification would be forwarded by the Qualification and
Certification Unit to the Technical Compliance and Investigation Division, which is responsible for coordinating
those cases involving revocation of certification. By transferring cases involving decertification from the district
offices to a single administrative office, the Agency would eliminate the likelihood that a person whose certification
is suspended or revoked could become recertified without fulfilling the necessary requirements.

IV. Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis contained in this preamble meets the Agency's responsibilities under Executive Order 12866 and the
Regulatory Flexibility Act. Under Executive Order 12866, MSHA has made a preliminary assessment of the costs and
benefits of the proposed rule. The proposed rule does not meet the criteria of a significant regulatory action and,
therefore, MSHA has not prepared a separate analysis of costs and benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Executive Order also requires Federal agencies to seek the views of State governments on regulatory actions that
would affect them. MSHA intends to work closely with the States that have certification programs to coordinate implementation
of this proposal. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires MSHA to consider the proposed rule's impact on small entities.
MSHA defines small entities as mines with 20 or fewer employees. This proposal would not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of such small mines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal addresses procedures for decertifying individuals, either temporarily or permanently, who have failed
to maintain the knowledge and skills required to perform certain tasks or duties of an ``approved,'' ``certified''
or ``qualified'' person or who have failed to comply with the law in their role as an approved, certified or qualified
person. Any costs associated with the requirement that an individual be certified to perform a specific task or duty
are not included in this analysis. Such costs are attributed to the Agency's existing certification requirements,
and this rule does not impose any new such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA estimates that about 105,000 individuals have been certified by the Agency to perform required procedures.
Many of these individuals have been certified in more than one area. In addition, MSHA estimates that about 20,000
mine foremen have been certified by State governments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear from MSHA's enforcement experience that some certified persons do not adhere to the Agency's requirements.
Therefore, the proposed rule establishes procedures for temporary or permanent decertification of such individuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA has not attributed any costs to the pay loss or potential loss of employment a certified person faces if Agency
action ultimately leads to that individual's decertification. Such costs result from the individual's failure
to follow Federal requirements, which in many instances could potentially endanger other miners. As such, these
costs are far outweighed by no longer allowing the individual to jeopardize the safety and health of other miners.
For the certified person, these losses would occur from the loss of pay differential or ultimately the loss of employment.
For the mine operator, these losses might range from the cost of retraining the individual to significant lost production
if the operator cannot readily replace someone who has been decertified. In order for the mine to continue production
after MSHA has decertified an individual, the mine operator would need to hire a replacement who has the proper certification
or qualification or have one of the more experienced miners achieve certification or qualification status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA has not attempted to calculate the financial losses that might accrue should an Agency decertification action
ultimately be overturned on appeal or if an individual convinces the district manager that decertification action
in not warranted. At this time, MSHA is unable to estimate how many such cases would occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA anticipates that the majority of actions under the proposed rule would begin with a letter from the MSHA district
manager to the certified person warning that the person's conduct in performing certain tasks is deficient. As proposed,
the warning letter may or may not require that remedial measures be undertaken by the individual.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSHA estimates that it would issue about 50 warning letters each year for the first few years_about half of which would
require some remedial action such as passing a skills test or undergoing retraining. Of the 50 warning letters each
year, MSHA estimates that about 20 would be issued to mine foremen who must be certified to perform various inspection
and examination activities, about 25 would be issued for coal dust sampling and 5 would be issued to miners certified
to perform such activities as electrical work or blasting. After the first few years, MSHA anticipates that the Agency
would need to issue fewer warning letters as mine operators and certified individuals become more aware of the Agency's
intent to ensure that these individuals perform their tasks as required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The proposed rule also would allow the district manager to forego the warning letter and send out a notice proposing
to temporarily or permanently decertify an individual who repeatedly exhibits disregard for health and safety,
and also in instances where a particular single offense is of such a serious nature that decertification is warranted.
MSHA estimates that the Agency annually would issue about 10 temporary and 10 permanent decertifications without
first issuing a warning letter. MSHA expects that temporary decertifications would last an average of one year and
would require the individual to reapply for certification and, perhaps, complete additional requirements, such
as retraining or testing. In all, MSHA estimates that the Agency would undertake in total about 70 decertification-related
actions a year (50 actions beginning with a warning letter and 20 actions without a warning letter). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 MSHA has attributed most of the costs of this proposal to legal fees. In many instances, MSHA expects that the certified
persons facing adverse Agency action would hire an attorney. The costs of such legal fees would vary widely depending
on the nature of the action, the level to which the case is appealed, and the legal fees of the attorney. Although a few
individuals may not seek legal counsel, others might retain an attorney upon the initial receipt of a warning letter.
In some instances, the attorney's services would not be needed beyond the initial response to the district manager.
In other instances, in-depth legal advice may be sought at each level of appeal all the way through the Federal Court
of Appeals. In general, however, MSHA believes that most individuals would not pursue appeal beyond the level of the
Department of Labor's Administrative Law Judges. MSHA estimates that initially about 30 percent of the 70 actions
taken by the Agency each year (or 21 individual cases) would result in appeals to the Departmental level. Legal fees
vary from region to region and law firm to law firm, ranging from as high as $400 per hour to as low as $50 per hour. In this
analysis, MSHA has used an average cost of $120 per hour. Assuming it takes an attorney about 40 hours to prepare and
appeal a client's case up through the Departmental level, costs of the proposed rule arising from legal fees would
total about $100,800 a year, or $4,800 per contest. Of course, the fees for appealing a single case through the Federal
Court of Appeals may total significantly more than $4,800. Conversely, the use of an attorney to draft a response to
the district manager to a warning letter could cost as little as $50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In addition, MSHA has assumed that the certified person would have to take time off from work to address decertification
actions initiated by the Agency. The average total compensation (wages plus fringe benefits) for a certified person
ranges from $24.74 to $28.50 per hour or an average of $26.50 per hour. Assuming that all 70 certified persons each takes
an average of 20 hours off from work to avail themselves of the procedures of the proposal, then the annual loss of income
attributable to responding to Agency's actions under the proposal would total about $37,100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 MSHA estimates that the total annual cost of this proposed rule to be about $137,900 ($100,800 related to legal fees
and $37,100 related to income loss during the appeal process). The Agency specifically requests comments concerning
these cost estimates; comments, including rationale, should be as specific as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Although MSHA does not have data at this time to estimate quantitative benefits, the Agency has determined that the
qualitative benefits of this proposed rule are improved safety and health conditions for miners. The possibility
of a temporary or permanent decertification should be an effective incentive for certified and qualified persons
to perform their duties and tasks as required. The potential loss of pay or possible unemployment resulting from decertification
should serve as a strong, economic incentive for certified persons to comply with the required procedures. As the
tasks and duties of certified persons are critical to the safety and health of miners, ensuring that these activities
are performed in the required manner should result in fewer fatalities, injuries, and accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A recent example of the need for formal decertification procedures involves the submission of fraudulent respirable
coal mine dust samples by some individuals certified to take them. To ensure the integrity of the respirable dust program,
the Agency needs more efficient decertification procedures to serve as a more effective deterrent to such illegal
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As a result of plea agreements or criminal convictions stemming from respirable dust fraud, MSHA has permanently
decertified 7 people and temporarily decertified another 73 individuals for periods ranging from one to four years
for respirable dust fraud. The Agency temporarily decertified about sixty-five percent of these individuals for
a one-year period and about thirty percent for a three-year period.

Additionally, as the result of recent investigations, MSHA has permanently decertified two training instructors
and temporarily decertified one training instructor for a three-year period. As a result of continuing criminal
proceedings, the Agency also temporarily decertified for a two-year period one person who performed noise surveys
and permanently decertified two individuals who performed noise surveys. MSHA temporarily decertified for a two-year
period another individual who was an approved electrical qualifications instructor.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a request for a State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision, addressing the Lake and Porter County ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the State of Indiana
for the purpose of offsetting any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or number of vehicle
trips, and to attain reduction in motor vehicle emissions, in combination with other emission reduction requirements,
as necessary to comply with Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) milestones and attainment requirements of the Clean
Air Act (Act). The rationale for this proposed approval is set forth below; additional information is available at
the address indicated below.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires States containing ozone nonattainment areas
classified as ``severe'' pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act to adopt transportation control measures (TCMs) and
transportation control strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips,
and to attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with other emission reduction requirements)
as necessary to comply with the Act's RFP milestones and attainment requirements. The requirements for establishing
a VMT Offset program are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to title I of the Act (57 FR 13498), in addition
to section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For certain programs required under the Act (including VMT&hyph;Offset), USEPA had earlier adopted a policy pursuant
to section 110(k)(4) of the Act to conditionally approve SIPs that committed to provide the USEPA with specific enforceable
measures by a date certain. That interpretation was challenged in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Natural Resources Defense Council v. Browner
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, consolidated lawsuits brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full
opinion, dated May 6, 1994 (and in a March 8, 1994 Order and April 22, 1994 Amended Order issued earlier), the Court found
that USEPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded USEPA's statutory authority. While the Court did not
specifically address the VMT Offset program in its orders or opinions, USEPA believes that the Court's general conclusions
that the USEPA's construction of the conditional approval provision was unlawful precludes USEPA from taking action
to approve any submitted VMT Offset committal SIPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 10, 1993, the USEPA published a proposed rule (58 FR 47701) to conditionally approve Indiana's commitment
for the VMT&hyph;Offset requirement. In light of the Court opinion, Indiana has withdrawn the committal SIP in a letter
dated July 5, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the outcome of the litigation, USEPA has decided that it would be appropriate to interpret the VMT Offset
provision of the Act to account for how States can practicably comply with each of the provision's elements. The VMT
Offset provision requires that States submit by November 15, 1992, specific enforceable TCMs and strategies to offset
any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips sufficient to allow total area emissions to comply
with the RFP and attainment requirements of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA has observed that these three elements (i.e., offsetting growth in mobile source emissions, attainment
of the RFP reduction, and attainment of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) create a timing problem
of which Congress was perhaps not fully aware. As discussed in USEPA's April 16, 1992, General Preamble to title I,
ozone nonattainment areas affected by this provision were not otherwise required to submit SIPs that show attainment
of the 1996 15% RFP milestone until November 15, 1993, and likewise are not required to demonstrate post-1996 RFP and
attainment of the NAAQS until November 15, 1994. The SIP demonstrations due on November 15, 1993, and on November 15,
1994, are broader in scope than growth in VMT or trips in that they necessarily address emission trends and control
measures for non motor vehicle emission sources and, in the case of attainment demonstrations, complex photochemical
modeling studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA does not believe that Congress intended the VMT Offset provision to advance the dates for these broader submissions.
Further, USEPA believes that the November 15, 1992, date would not allow sufficient time for States to have fully developed
specific sets of measures that would comply with all of the elements of the VMT Offset requirements of section 182(d)(1)(A)
over the long term. Consequently, USEPA believes it would be appropriate to interpret the Act to provide the following
alternative set of staged deadlines for submittal of elements of the VMT Offset SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this interpretation, the three required elements of section 182(d)(1)(A) are separable, and can be divided
into three separate submissions that could be submitted on different dates. Section 179(a) of the Act, in establishing
how USEPA would be required to apply mandatory sanctions if a State fails to submit a full SIP also provides that the
sanctions clock starts if a State fails to submit one or more SIP elements, as determined by the Administrator. The
USEPA believes that this language provides USEPA the authority to determine that the different elements of a SIP submission
are separable. Moreover, given the continued timing problems addressed above, USEPA believes it is appropriate
to allow States to separate the VMT Offset SIP into three elements, each to be submitted at different times: (1) The
initial requirement to submit TCMs that offset growth in emissions; (2) the requirement to comply with the 15% periodic
reduction requirement of the Act; and (3) the requirement to comply with the post-1996 periodic reduction and attainment
requirements of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this approach, the first element, the emissions offset element, was due on November 15, 1992. The USEPA believes
this element is not necessarily dependent on the development of the other elements. The State could submit the emissions
growth offset element independent of an analysis of that element's consistency with the periodic reduction and attainment
requirements of the Act. Emissions trends from other sources need not be considered to show compliance with this offset
requirement. As submitting this element in isolation does not implicate the timing problem of advancing deadlines
for RFP and attainment demonstrations, USEPA does not believe it is necessary to extend the statutory deadline for
submittal of the emissions growth offset element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the 15% RFP requirement of the Act, was due on November
15, 1993, which is the same date on which the 15% RFP SIP itself was due under section 182(b)(1) of the Act. The USEPA believes
it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the entire 15% SIP was due, as this allows
States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address the 15% reduction requirement and assure that the TCM elements
required under section 182(d)(1)(A) are consistent with the remainder of the 15% demonstration. Indeed, USEPA believes
that only upon submittal of the broader 15% plan can a State have had the necessary opportunity to coordinate it's VMT
strategy with it's 15% plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third element, which requires the VMT Offset SIP to comply with the post-1996 RFP and attainment requirements
of the Act, will be due on November 15, 1994, the statutory deadline for those broader submissions. The USEPA believes
it is reasonable to extend the deadline for this element to the date on which the post-1996 RFP and attainment SIPs are
due for the same reasons it is reasonable to extend the deadline for the second element. First, it is arguably impossible
for a State to make the showing required by section 182(d)(1)(A) for the third element until the broader demonstrations
have been developed by the State. Moreover, allowing States to develop the comprehensive strategy to address post-1996
RFP and attainment by providing a fuller opportunity to assure that the TCM elements comply with the broader RFP and
attainment demonstrations, will result in a better program for reducing emissions in the long term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 17, 1993, Indiana submitted to USEPA documentation to fulfill the first and second elements of the VMT&hyph;Offset
SIP. A public hearing was held on December 14, 1993, and documentation on the public hearing was submitted to complete
the SIP revision request. Indiana does not at this time anticipate the need for additional TCMs to meet the attainment
demonstration requirement but will submit any necessary TCMs with the attainment demonstration SIP.

Evaluation of the State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act requires the State to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT. As discussed
in the General Preamble, the purpose is to prevent a growth in motor vehicle emissions from canceling out the emission
reduction benefits of the federally mandated programs in the Act. The USEPA interprets this provision to require
that sufficient measures be adopted so that projected motor vehicle volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions will
never be higher during the ozone season in one year than during the ozone season in the year before. When growth in VMT
and vehicle trips would otherwise cause a motor vehicle emissions upturn, this upturn must be prevented. The emissions
level at the point of upturn becomes a ceiling on motor vehicle emissions. This requirement applies to projected emissions
in the years between the submission of the SIP revision and the attainment deadline and is above and beyond the separate
requirements for the RFP and the attainment demonstrations. The ceiling level is defined therefore, up to the point
of upturn, as motor vehicle emissions that would occur in the ozone season of that year, with VMT growth, if all measures
for that area in that year were implemented as required by the Act. When this curve begins to turn up due to growth in VMT
or vehicle trips, the ceiling becomes a fixed value. The ceiling line would include the effects of Federal measures
such as new motor vehicle standards, phase II RVP controls, and reformulated gasoline, as well as the Act mandated
SIP requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Indiana has demonstrated in its submittal of November 17, 1993, that the predicted growth in VMT in Lake
and Porter Counties, Indiana, is not expected to result in a growth in motor vehicle emissions that will negate the
effects of the reductions mandated by the Act. Further, Indiana has projected motor vehicle emissions to the year
2007 and, using the most current socioeconomic data, has not predicted an upturn in motor vehicle emissions. In the
event that the projected socioeconomic data and associated VMT grow more rapidly than currently predicted, Indiana
is required by section 182(c)(5) to track actual VMT starting with 1996 and every three years there after to demonstrate
that the actual VMT is equal to or less than the projected VMT. TCMs will be required to offset VMT that is above the projected
levels (section 182(c)(5)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The VMT offset submittal from Indiana dated November 17, 1993, contains the final report ``TCMs to Offset Emissions
from VMT Growth in Northwestern Indiana.'' The report used the most current socioeconomic data and the travel network
model in conjunction with the MOBILE5a to estimate mobile source emissions to the attainment year of 2007.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This report also documents the progress Indiana has made in evaluating TCMs to reduce growth in VMT and thus reduce
emissions. Indiana may choose to take credit for TCM emission reductions as part of the post 1996 RFP requirement or
to meet the attainment requirement. Not only has Indiana evaluated the effectiveness and predicted impact of a number
of TCMs but actual implementation of selected TCMs has been ongoing. For example, a new inter city bus route to link
the cities of Hammond, East Chicago and Gary, Indiana has been started. These three cities have operated established
intra city bus routes for many years and this is the first route to link the already existing transit services for these
cities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These specific TCMs however, are not a part of the current SIP revision request and are not a required portion of this
SIP revision. Thus, Indiana is not currently taking credit for the emission reductions from these TCM measures and
the State is not bound to implement or continue to implement any specific TCMs. These measures, however, illustrate
Indiana's work in evaluating and implementing TCMs to meet the requirements of the Act. Also, the TCMs may be used in
subsequent SIP submittals as necessary to meet the post 1996 RFP requirement or the attainment requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, Indiana is implementing TCMs to complement the employee commute options (ECO) program which requires
a 25 percent reduction in single occupancy vehicle usage for home to work trips for employers of 100 or more persons.
Activities include: Planning and promotion, new bus routes, improved transit service, and carpooling match-up
services. A number of TCMs have been implemented in Lake and Porter Counties through use of the Department of Transportation's
congestion mitigation and air quality funds under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. These
projects have included: purchasing clean fueled buses, operation of new bus service, improved transit service and
ECO activities. In conclusion, Indiana is evaluating and implementing TCMs as expeditiously as possible even when
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions projections indicate that mobile source emissions will continue to decline without additional TCMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indiana submitted a 15 percent RFP SIP for northwest Indiana to the USEPA in November 1993, but the submittal was found
incomplete in a letter dated January 25, 1994. The RFP SIP lacked enforceable regulations and a public hearing. The
public hearing was held on March 29, 1994. Although the RFP SIP is still incomplete due to the lack of enforceable regulations.
Indiana's submittal does indicate that TCM's would not be necessary to attain the 15% reduction required by 1996.
The RFP SIP asserts that a 15% reduction in emissions could be achieved by 1996 through the feasible measures detailed
in the SIP submittal. Under the approach contained in the submittal, the State would achieve the 15% reduction in VOCs
through measures other than relying on TCMs. The majority of the reduction would be obtained from stationary source
shut downs. Other measures include enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance and reformulated gasoline. For
the attainment demonstration which is due November 14, 1994, Indiana has indicated that it will include TCMs as necessary
to reach attainment.

Summary of Findings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the requested SIP revision submittal, Indiana has projected motor vehicle emissions until the statutory attainment
year of 2007 using the most recent population and economic growth projections. These projections went through public
hearing and comment on December 14, 1993. Using current VMT forecasts, these projections show that motor vehicle
emissions are not expected to rise above the ceiling level through the year 2007.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Indiana has identified and evaluated a number of specific TCMs to reduce single occupancy vehicle usage.
Several of these identified TCMs are currently being implemented. The VMT offset submittal from Indiana dated November
17, 1993, contains the final report ``TCMs to Offset Emissions from VMT Growth in Northwestern Indiana.'' This report
documents the progress Indiana has made in evaluating TCMs to reduce growth in VMT and thus reduce emissions. Indiana
has evaluated the effectiveness and predicted impact of a number of TCMs through actual implementation of selected
TCMs, although these TCMs are not a part of the SIP revision and Indiana is not taking emission reduction credit for
these TCMs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indiana has met the first and second requirements of the VMT offset plan. Indiana has identified and evaluated TCMs
to reduce VMT. Regarding the first requirement, Indiana has demonstrated in the November 17, 1993, submittal that
projected growth in VMT is not expected to result in an increase in emissions from motor vehicles and is not expected
to negate the progress in emissions reductions required to meet attainment of the standard by 2007. Regarding the
second element, Indiana listed in its incomplete 15% RFP submittal feasible measures intended to meet the 15% reduction
by 1996 without relying on TCMs and has shown that further TCMs are not necessary to meet the second element of section
182(d)(1)(A). The third requirement is for Indiana to use TCMs as necessary to meet the attainment of the standard.
This third requirement will be submitted with the attainment demonstration SIP and will be addressed in future proposed
and final rules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the submittal accompanying the State's SIP revision request, USEPA proposes to approve the SIP revision
submitted by the State of Indiana as satisfying the first two of the three VMT offset plan requirements. Public comments
are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. Comments received by December
2, 1994, will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory
action from Executive Order 12866 review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover, due to
the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would
constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions
concerning SIPs on such grounds. See

The main purpose of this meeting is to allow the public to give comment to the peer reviewers on the proposed hazard ranking
technical support document which describes the EPA's approach to relatively rank the 189 Hazardous Air Pollutants
(HAP) listed in the 1990 Amendments. The section 112(g) rulemaking was proposed April 1, 1994 (59 FR 15504). Copies
of the technical support document are available via the Technology Transfer Network [a network of electronic bulletin
boards developed and operated by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, phone (919) 541&hyph;5384]
or by contacting the EPA office of Air and Radiation Docket [Docket

at the meeting should contact Dr. Jane Caldwell (U.S. EPA, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Emission
Standards Division, Maildrop 13, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711 (919) 541&hyph;0328 Fax: (919) 541&hyph;4028)
by November 15, 1994. In general each individual or group making an oral presentation will be limited to fifteen minutes
but the time allowed will be dependent on the number of speakers. Seating at the meeting will be on a first come first
serve basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 112 of the 1990 Amendments establishes a control technology-based program to reduce stationary source emissions
of HAP. In section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, the 189 HAP are defined as hazardous for the purposes of regulation. Section
112(g) requires control technology reviews for new, modified and reconstructed major sources of these pollutants.
Increases in hazardous air pollution emissions from existing major sources are not considered a modification if
they can be offset by equal or greater decreases in HAP deemed ``more hazardous''. Furthermore, the HAP ``with no safety
threshold of exposure'' may only be offset by other such ``nonthreshold'' pollutants. Therefore, threshold and
nonthreshold pollutants must be identified and are subject to offsetting restrictions. The proposed section 112(g)
rulemaking contains the EPA's guidance that identifies the relative hazard to human health of these hazardous pollutants
and application of that characterization for determining allowing offsets.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Interregional Research Project No. 4 (IR-4), New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers
University, New Brunswick, NJ 08903, has submitted pesticide petition (PP) 2E4148 to EPA on behalf of the Agricultural
Experiment Station of California. Pesticide petition 2E4148 requested that the Administrator, pursuant to section
408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), establish an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for residues of sodium chlorate on potatoes when used as a defoliant in accordance with good agricultural
practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The data submitted in the petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicological data considered
in support of the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A 90-day subchronic feeding study in rats given gavage doses of 0, 10, 100, or 1,000 milligrams (mg)/kilogram(kg)/day
with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 100 mg/kg. Rats given doses of 1,000 mg/kg/day showed decreased hemoglobin
concentration, hematocrit, and red blood cell counts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A subchronic study in monkeys given drinking water containing 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/liter of sodium chlorate
with no adverse clinical or hematological findings reported.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Mutagenicity studies including gene mutation tests in Salmonella species (Ames test) and Chinese hamster lung
cells, structural chromosome aberrations test in mice (a micronucleus assay for chromosome damage), and other genotoxic
effects (unscheduled DNA synthesis in HeLa cells) were all negative for mutagenic effects. A DNA repair test was positive
for primary DNA damage in repair-deficient bacterial cultures of Escherichia coli.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A developmental toxicity study in rats given gavage doses 0, 10, 100, and 1,000 mg/kg with no maternal or developmental
toxicity observed under the conditions of the study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The toxicology data provided are sufficient to demonstrate that there are no foreseeable human health hazards likely
to arise from dietary exposure resulting from the proposed use of sodium chlorate on potatoes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the residues in plants is understood; sodium chlorate will be reduced to sodium chloride in the presence
of organic material. The residues in plants will, therefore, be composed of sodium chlorate and sodium chloride.
Magnitude of residue studies report no detectable residues of sodium chlorate on potatoes from the proposed use pattern.
There is also no reasonable expectation of secondary residues in meat, milk, poultry, or eggs from the proposed use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No enforcement actions based on the level of residues in food are expected. Therefore, the requirement for an analytical
method for enforcement purposes is not applicable to the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information and data considered, the Agency concludes that a tolerance is not needed to protect the public
health. Therefore, it is proposed that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide, under the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended, which contains any of the ingredients listed herein, may request
within 30 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the FFDCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation
indicating the document control number, [PP 2E4148/P589]. All written comments filed in response to this petition
will be available in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

 EPA received from Walt Disney World Co., P.O. Box 10000, Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830, pesticide petition (PP) 4F4387
on July 14, 1994, proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to exempt from the requirement of a tolerance the residues of the biological pesticide 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Pasteuria penetrans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 in or on all raw agricultural commodities when used as a nematicide in producing fruits and vegetables (other than
vegetables whose roots or tubers are considered to be food items) in greenhouses at The Land in EPCOT Center at Walt
Disney World. This petition is not associated with an application for pesticide registration. The establishment
of this tolerance exemption would not relieve manufacturers, distributors, or sellers of this pesticide of any obligation
they may have under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, 7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.

 reproduces by means of endospores which remain dormant in the soil until contacted by a migrating juvenile nematode.
The spore attaches itself to the nematode and is carried by the nematode into a plant root. The endospore germinates
and invades the body of the nematode where it eventually produces new endospores that are released into the soil following
the death of the nematode and decomposition of root tissue. The infected nematodes do not produce eggs and therefore
do not reproduce.

The information submitted in support of this petition and all other relevant material have been evaluated. Literature
citations regarding the nature of this organism were considered adequate to support an exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for the limited use of this biological pesticide. Additionally, since

 is a common inhabitant of soils in areas infested with nematodes, including the area of Florida where the organism
will be used. The microorganism will only be applied to the soil in greenhouses, and use in this manner would result
in its presence only in the soil and roots of plants grown in the greenhouses. The proposed exemption excludes plant
roots which will be used for food purposes since the nematode and the associated parasite will be contained in the root
portion of such plants. Since there are no data available regarding any possible effects from the consumption of elevated
levels of either nematodes or their parasites, roots and tubers which may contain these organisms have been excluded
from this exemption from tolerance requirements. Above-ground parts of plants harvested from treated soil would
not be expected to contain levels of

 above that normally found in crops harvested under natural conditions and consumed on a daily basis. The information
submitted is adequate to show that there are no forseeable human or domestic health hazards likely to arise from the
use of the product as a nematicide in connection with the production of fruits and vegetables in greenhouses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the submitted petition for an exemption from tolerance requirements for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limited the use of the organism to greenhouses at The Land in EPCOT Center at Walt Disney World, the Agency believes
that this limitation is overly restrictive. Based on the lack of any known hazards from the use of this organism in the
manner described, the Agency has elected not to impose a geographic restriction for the use of this biological nematicide.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Therefore, the regulation is proposed as set forth below.

Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is
``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis,
review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those
actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious
inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering
the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues
arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore
not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat.
1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising
tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements, or establishing or raising food additive
regulations do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The B. F. Goodrich Co., 3925 Embassy Parkway, Akron, OH 44313-1799, submitted pesticide petition (PP) 4E4298 to EPA
requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA)
(21 U.S.C. 346a(e)), propose to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance
for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer (CAS Reg. No. 27756-15-6) when used as an inert ingredient
(emulsifier, suspending agent, or rheology modifier) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops, or to
raw agricultural commodities after harvest, or to animals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but
are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own):
solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers
such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading,
and dispersing agents; propellents in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term
``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the publication of the proposal of B. F. Goodrich's request on February 25, 1994 (59 FR 9165), the Agency
received a comment from the requestor (B. F. Goodrich) objecting to the proposed rule's requirement of a 1,250,000
minimum number-average molecular weight for the copolymer, stating that it was inconsistent with the October 28,
1992 final rule and would ``* * * place an unnecessary burden on both Industry and the Agency to list the same copolymer
every time there is a desire to use a high molecular weight polymer not meeting a 1,250,000 requirement.'' The referenced
final rule (57 FR 48736) established an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of acrylic acid-stearyl
methacrylate copolymer under 40 CFR 180.1001(d), for use on growing crops, without containing a molecular weight
limitation. The commentor stated that it was not their intention to limit the tolerance exemption for acrylic acid-stearyl
methacrylate copolymer to a minimum number average molecular weight of 1,250,000 in the proposed rule and sought
to eliminate the molecular weight limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency agrees that an apparent inconsistency exists. The basis for the February 25, 1994, proposed rule was conformance
to the criteria described in 40 CFR 723.250, which requires a reference to a minimum molecular weight. The previously
established tolerance exemption under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) also relied on the fact that acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate
copolymer conformed to 40 CFR 723.250; however, a minimum number-average molecular weight was inadvertently omitted
from that rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information was requested to be submitted by the petitioner to support the use of a new minimum-number
average molecular weight for acrylic acid stearyl methacrylate copolymer which would still conform to 40 CFR 723.250.
The requested information was provided, and the Agency is hereby proposing that the exemption from the requirement
of a tolerance for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer specify the minimum number-average molecular weight
as 2,500. EPA is deleting the entry for this chemical under 40 CFR 180.1001(d) because the requested expansion to section
180.1001(c) incorporates uses on growing crops as well as raw agricultural commodities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement
on inert ingredients published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks
posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. However, where it can be determined without
that data that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not require some or all
of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert
ingredient. The Agency has decided that no data, in addition to that described below, for acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate
copolymer will need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of certain chemical substances that are defined as ``polymers,'' the Agency has established a set of criteria
which identify categories of polymers that present low risk. These criteria (described in 40 CFR 723.250) identify
polymers that are relatively unreactive and stable compared to other chemical substances as well as polymers that
typically are not readily absorbed. These properties generally limit a polymer's ability to cause adverse effects.
In addition, these criteria exclude polymers about which little is known. The Agency believes that polymers meeting
the criteria noted above will present minimal or no risk. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer conforms
to the definition of a polymer given in 40 CFR 723.250(b) (11) and meets the following criteria that are used to identify
low-risk polymers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The minimum number-average molecular weight of the acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is 2,500. Substances
with molecular weights greater than 400 generally are not absorbed through the intact skin, and substances with molecular
weights greater than 1,000 generally are not absorbed through the intact gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Chemicals
not absorbed through skin or GI tract generally are incapable of eliciting a toxic response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not a cationic polymer, nor is it reasonably anticipated to become
a cationic polymer in a natural aquatic environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain less than 32.0 percent by weight of the atomic element
carbon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer contains as an integral part of its composition the atomic elements
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain as an integral part of its composition, except as
impurities, any elements other than those listed in 40 CFR 723.250(d)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not a biopolymer, a synthetic equivalent of a biopolymer, or a
derivative or a modification of a biopolymer that is substantially intact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not manufactured from reactants containing, other than impurities,
halogen atoms or cyano groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer does not contain a reactive functional group that is intended, or
reasonably anticipated, to undergo further reaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Acrylic acid-stearyl methacrylate copolymer is not designed, or reasonably anticipated, to substantially degrade,
decompose, or depolymerize.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information above and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural
practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA
proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below.

would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new
use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing or processing activities for a use designated
by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended
use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur.

I. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances. Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and
EPA regulatory procedures as submitters of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular,
these requirements include the information submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions
authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3), and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives
a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it
has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action. Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are
subject to the export notification provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b)
appear at 40 CFR part 707.

II. Applicability of General Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. Regulatory provisions
covering user fees applicable to significant new use notices are codified at 40 CFR part 700 under the authority of
TSCA section 26(b). Interested persons may refer to these sections for further information.

-oxazolo[3,4-c]oxazole. The proposed SNUR designates as significant new uses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Exposure to the PMN substance without ocular protection (chemical goggles or equivalent eye protection). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Any predictable or purposeful release of the PMN substance to surface water above 500 ppb (parts per billion). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 19, 1991, EPA received a PMN (P&hyph;91&hyph;1324) for dihydro-7a-methyl-1

-oxazolo[3,4-c]oxazole. EPA had concerns that the substance may be a severe eye irritant based on test data available
on other aliphatic amines and oxazoles. Also, based on that data, irritation to the exposed eye is exacerbated by irrigation.
In a letter to the Company dated December 6, 1991, EPA predicted that releases of spent metalworking fluids containing
the PMN substance could result in surface water concentrations as high as 16 ppm (parts per million). Assuming rapid
hydrolysis of the PMN substance, the resulting surface water concentration is expected to significantly exceed
the Agency's level of concern for the hydrolysis product. To mitigate the Agency's concern regarding aquatic toxicity,
the company was required to perform a 96&hyph;h bioassay in algae (40 CFR 797.1050), a 48&hyph;h LC50 test in daphnids
(40 CFR 797.1300), and a 96&hyph;h LC50 test in fish (40 CFR 797.1400). Based on the results of this information, the
Agency would reassess its surface water concentration estimates for the PMN substance and its hydrolysis products.
The letter also recommended that each worker exposed to the PMN substance be required to wear adequate ocular protection
once they were allowed to manufacture or import. EPA has concerns for environmental effects of the PMN substance based
on quantitative structure activity relationships (``QSARs'') derived from test data on analogous aliphatic amines
and oxazoles. The following ecotoxicity values for the PMN substance were predicted: 307 mg/L for fish 96&hyph;h
LC50, 19 mg/L for daphnid 48&hyph;h LC50, and 21 mg/L for algal 96&hyph;h EC50, and algal chronic value (ChV) = 3.4 mg/L,
with a concentration of concern of 0.200 mg/L. The Company suspended the PMN review period and conducted the 96&hyph;h
bioassay in algae, 48&hyph;h LC50 test in

, and 96&hyph;h LC50 test in fish. The data was completed and submitted to the Agency for validation and review. The
results of the studies were acceptable; however, suggestions from the Agency in performing the studies were not followed.
For the aquatic toxicity testing, the Agency recommended that the PMN substance be tested two ways: The PMN substance
added directly to the exposure vessels and organisms added within 10 minutes, and the PMN substance tested completely
hydrolyzed. The Company tested the PMN substance two ways, but they did not test by direct dilution. Direct dilution
is adding the PMN substance directly to exposure vessels without the preparation of a stock solution. They prepared
an aqueous stock solution which they added to the exposure vessels. Preparing an aqueous stock solution resulted
in some unknown amount of hydrolysis, thus reducing the difference between the two recommended tests, i.e. unhydrolyzed
PMN versus completely hydrolyzed PMN substance. The Agency accepted the test data, however, because (1) the unhydrolyzed
PMN substance was predicted to be less toxic than the hydrolysis products of the PMN substance and (2) the hydrolysis

 (half-life) of the PMN substance appeared to be much shorter than predicted during the initial review. The results
from the first type, i.e., case (1), of toxicity study were as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The fish and daphnid acute toxicity values were predicted by calculating the difference between the partially and
completely hydrolyzed chemical using test data for green algal 96&hyph;h EC50 values, i.e., a factor of 4.0. The fish
and daphnid ChVs were predicted assuming an ACR = 10.0. No other additional testing was recommended by the Agency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review period inadvertently expired prior to EPA making a final determination on the PMN substance. The Company
stated that they did not expect to commence manufacturing the PMN substance any time in the near future, but did not
withdraw the PMN from review. The only releases which may exceed the concern concentration would occur during use.
It was predicted that 99 percent of the PMN substance would undergo hydrolysis; however, negligible removal of the
hydrolysis products was expected during wastewater treatment. The surface water concentration of hydrolysis products
resulting from releases from large metalworking shops is the only situation in which EPA expects the concern concentration
would be exceeded. Based on the completed review of toxicity data on the PMN chemical submitted to the Agency and the
use scenario described in the PMN application, releases to surface water exceeding 500 ppb would be toxic to aquatic
organisms. Therefore, the issuance of a Non-5(e) Notice and Comment SNUR requiring the use of ocular protection for
workers who will be exposed to the PMN substance and any releases of the PMN substance to surface water resulting in
surface water concentrations above 500 ppb would be considered a significant new use.

IV. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the final rule. If uses which commence between that date
and the effective date of the final rule were considered ongoing, rather than new, any person could defeat the SNUR
by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR
notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance for
uses identified in this SNUR after the proposed date of the final rule will have to cease any such activity before the
effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR
notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires. EPA, not wishing
to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of a
significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions to allow such persons to comply
with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions of advance compliance as codified
at &sect;721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements of the final SNUR for those activities.
If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the substance between proposal and the effective
date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they must cease that activity before the effective
date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements
and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions, expires.

submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file.

EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50611). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received. EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any
time between this proposal and designation of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record
by the date of promulgation. A public version of the record, without any CBI, is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential
Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located
in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC.

VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact
Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant
regulatory action'' as an action likely to lead to a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million
or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically
significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by
another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms
of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject
to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has determined that approximately 10 percent
of the parties affected by the rule could be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for these substances.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule will not be substantial, even if all
of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0012. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated
to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response, with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office
of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond
to any OMB or public comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 8, 1994, the Department of the Interior issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (59 FR 40319) to revise the
natural resource damage assessment regulations. The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish
procedures for assessing damages for injury to natural resources resulting from a discharge of oil into navigable
waters under the Clean Water Act, or a release of a hazardous substance under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act. The August 8, 1994 proposed rule describes a procedure for simplified assessments
for relatively minor discharges or releases in Great Lakes environments. The Department is extending the period
for comment on the proposed rule and soliciting comment on an additional aspect of the type A procedure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The natural resource damage assessment regulations establish procedures that Federal, State, and Tribal natural
resource trustees may use to obtain compensation from liable parties for natural resource injuries under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) and the Clean Water
Act, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). The regulations provide an administrative process for conducting assessments
as well as two types of technical procedures for the actual determination of injuries and damages. ``Type A'' procedures
are standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation in cases of minor discharges
or releases in certain environments. ``Type B'' procedures are site-specific procedures for detailed assessments
in other cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 8, 1994, the Department of the Interior published a proposed rule to amend the regulations to include an additional
type A procedure for assessing natural resource damages in Great Lakes environments. The proposed procedure incorporates
a computer model called the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Model for Great Lakes Environments Version 1.31 (NRDAM/GLE).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the August 8, 1994, proposed rule was originally set to close on November 7, 1994. The Department
has received numerous requests for additional time to comment on the proposed rule. The requesters have emphasized
the large volume of technical documentation accompanying the NRDAM/GLE, all of which is subject to public review
and comment. Some requesters are assembling multidisciplinary teams to assist in the review of the model and associated
databases. The Department appreciates the level of technical review that is underway and is therefore extending
the comment period by 90 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also solicits comment on an additional aspect of the proposed type A procedure for Great Lakes environments.
The proposed NRDAM/GLE is supported by a geographic information system (GIS) that supplies geographically distributed
information to the submodels. The submodels divide the Great Lakes into a series of rectangular grids. The proposed
NRDAM/GLE assigns a habitat type to each cell within the grids. Under the August 8, 1994 proposed rule, trustee officials
would not be allowed to modify the habitat designations in the final version of the model if they wished to obtain a rebuttable
presumption for their assessments. The Department specifically requested commenters to review the habitat designations
and provide information about possible revisions that should be made in the final version of the model. 59 FR 40330.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department remains committed to ensuring that the final version of the NRDAM/GLE reflects the most accurate habitat
information available. However, the Department is now soliciting comment on whether to revise the rule to allow trustee
officials to modify the habitat designations in the final version of the NRDAM/GLE and still obtain a rebuttable presumption.
Allowing trustee officials to modify the habitat designations might enable fine-tuning of the model to better reflect
reality. On the other hand, type A procedures are designed to simplify assessments, reduce fieldwork, and narrow
the potential areas of dispute. Providing an option to modify the habitat designations could undermine these goals.
Therefore, the Department solicits comment on whether the final rule should allow trustee officials to modify the
habitat designations and, if so, under what conditions.

The Commission is concerned that its present self-insurance standards may be inadequate, but it will consider an
approach whereby it would restore its former ((net worth = 100% UPR) + (working capital = 100% UPR)) standard,17 but
require prospective self-insurers to provide alternative coverage for a percentage (

Summary of NPRM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A petition for rulemaking was filed by Adcomm Engineering Co. (Adcomm), to amend part 68 of the rules to require interoperability
between PBXs and enhanced 911 emergency calling systems. See FCC Report No. 1922 (RM&hyph;8143) released December
29, 1992. The Texas Advisory Commission on State Emergency Communications (TX&hyph;ACSEC) under the Office of the
Attorney General for the state of Texas filed a petition for reconsideration in the Commission's proceeding on personal
communications services (PCS) (GEN Dkt. 90&hyph;314) requesting Commission action to ensure the compatibility
of PCS with enhanced 911 emergency calling systems. This NPRM also addresses an Emergency Access Position Paper,
filed by the Associated Public Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc. (APCO), the National Emergency
Number Association (NENA), the National Association of State Nine One One Administrators (NASNA), and the Personal
Communications Industry Association (PCIA), which presents the consensus recommendations of these organizations
to assist in developing appropriate standards for emergency access from wireless service systems to 9&hyph;1&hyph;1
systems. We seek comment on proposals for insuring the compatibility of PBXs and other dispersed private telephone
systems with enhanced 911 emergency services. Second, we propose to adopt rules that would require wireless services
to include features that will make enhanced 911 services available to mobile radio callers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Dispersed Private Telephone Systems and Enhanced 911 Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM proposes to require that PBX and similar equipment: (a) have the capability of automatically providing a
caller's number and location to the public safety answering points (PSAPs) where the calls are received; (b) permit
callers to obtain access to a PSAP by dialing 911, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without dialing ``9'' or another access code to obtain an outside dialtone; and (c) have the capability to alert, and
provide calling information to, an attendant at the location served by a dispersed private telephone system so that
an attendant may assist in responding to an emergency. These requirements would apply to PBX equipment manufactured
or imported one year after rules ultimately adopted in this proceeding or installed eighteen months after that date.
Under the proposed rules, PBX equipment manufactured or imported during the first year must be labeled with emergency
dialing instructions both on the device and on the outside of the packaging in which it is marketed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Wireless Services and Enhanced 911 Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to require commercial mobile radio services (CMRS) that provide, or are capable of providing, real time
voice services to include features that will make enhanced 911 services available to mobile radio callers. These
features include Station Number Identification (SNI), Automatic Location Information (ALI), and Selecting Routing
(SR).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose that: (a) Customers of mobile radio services be able to obtain access to emergency services by dialing 911
without having to dial additional digits; (b) such callers be able to place 911 calls without meeting any mobile radio
service user validation requirements; and (c) mobile radio service calls to 911 be placed at the beginning of any queue
of calls awaiting availability of radio or network resources. The NPRM proposes to require that mobile radio services
furnish information necessary for emergency service providers to locate a 911 caller who is using a mobile radio unit,
and that mobile radio services permit PSAPs to call back immediately a mobile unit from which a 911 call has been received.
The NPRM seeks comment on a proposal that mobile radio equipment that does not conform to the performance criteria
proposed in the NPRM must be labelled with a warning that access to 911 is limited and a description that specifies those
limitations. Further, the NPRM seeks comment on whether mobile radio services should provide PSAPs with common channel
signalling information elements, including subscriber's name and routing information, to direct the call to the
proper PSAP. In addition, the NPRM requests comment on ensuring access to 911 service by text telephone devices (TTY)
that use wireless services. The NPRM seeks comment on when these requirements should be imposed, and seeks analysis
of the technical and cost considerations involved.

4. Additional Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM seeks comment on whether or what privacy considerations should apply to the provision of enhanced 911 services,
and seeks analysis of any additional issues that should be considered to ensure that the benefits of 911 services are
not diminished by new developments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Notice of Proposed Rule Making responds to the petitions submitted by TX&hyph;ACSEC and Adcomm to address issues
raised by the provision of enhanced 911 services through commercial mobile radio systems, private branch exchanges,
and other dispersed private telephone system equipment. Telephone stations for wireline stations served by PBX
or similar equipment and for wireless services are not adequately identifying caller location to permit a timely
response by emergency services personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective of this proposal is to ensure access to enhanced 911 emergency systems on the public switched telephone
network for callers served by private branch exchange other dispersed private telephone systems, and for callers
served by certain mobile services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Private branch exchanges and other dispersed private telephone systems will be required to maintain records for
calling number identification, caller location identification, and a call-back number for each of their calling
stations. Commercial mobile radio services will be required to identify the location of mobile transmitters and
provide call-back numbers for them. Equipment used for private branch exchanges and other dispersed private systems
and commercial mobile radio services will have to be capable of providing this information to the local telephone
exchanges to which they are connected. Local telephone exchanges will incur costs storing and relaying this information
to enhanced 911 public service answering points.

 This notice proposes amendments to the Federal motor vehicle standard on lighting to substitute SAE J576 JUL91 for
the currently incorporated J576c as the referenced standard on plastics materials, to substitute ASTM D 1003&hyph;92
for ASTM D 1003&hyph;61 in the test procedures, to allow alternative processing techniques, sample sizes and thickness
tolerances to those presently specified. Alternatively, the notice proposes amendments to the existing requirements
that would accomplish the same ends. This action is taken pursuant to a grant of a petition for rulemaking submitted
by Heraeus DSET Laboratories, Inc.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Heraeus DSET Laboratories, Inc. (``DSET''), of Phoenix, Arizona, petitioned NHTSA for rulemaking to amend Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 108, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, DSET asked that paragraph S5.1.2 be amended ``to update the weathering and heat testing requirements
of plastic material used for optical parts such as lenses and reflectors.'' Currently, these materials are required
to conform to SAE Recommended Practice J576c, May 1970. DSET wants NHTSA ``to allow alternative processing techniques
besides injection molding to produce test specimens, to allow test specimen sizes other than a 3 inch diameter disc
and to change the specimen thickness tolerances from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
0.005 inch to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
.010 inch.'' Those requirements for injection molding and for the diameter and thickness of the test specimen are
set forth in J576c, May 1970.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petition set forth five reasons in support. The first is that the requirement in Standard No. 108 (SAE J576c) that
test samples be injection molded is ``technology limiting'' and other methods of test specimen fabrication exist
and should be allowed. SAE J576 JUL91 allows alternative processing techniques to produce test specimens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, SAE J576 JUL91 contains no sample shape or diameter requirement, in contrast to Standard No. 108's present
restriction to a round sample of 3-inch diameter. DSET submits that there is no technical reason to continue the limit
for the test specimen.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, DSET stated that no technical reason exists to limit the test specimen thickness tolerance to 0.005 inch (or
0.13 mm as NHTSA expresses it). Accordingly, the petitioner recommends 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.010 inch (0.25 mm), ``since this appears to be a more reasonable tolerance that almost all plastic lens materials
manufacturers can meet.'' The petitioner said that many manufacturers currently have trouble meeting the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.005 inch tolerance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, DSET believes that States impose a burden on manufacturers to test according to Standard No. 108. Although
49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 and Standard No. 108 do not require a manufacturer to conduct testing in producing and certifying
a vehicle or item of equipment (the requirement is that the product meet all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards when tested according to the procedures specified), DSET says that many State laws require proof of testing
according to Standard No. 108. This means that even if there are alternative processing techniques for plastics that
have been developed as a result of advancing technology, the manufacturer is obliged to follow the test procedures
of Standard No. 108.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, DSET said that SAE J576c has been out of print for many years. Its unavailability has resulted in manufacturers
routinely submitting ``test specimens that do not meet the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.005 inch thickness tolerance or the 3 [inch] diameter size requirement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed DSET's petition and has found that there is a reasonable possibility that the amendments asked
for would occur at the conclusion of a rulemaking proceeding. Accordingly, the agency has granted DSET's petition.
The requested changes would appear to simplify the test requirements of Standard No. 108 without degrading safety.
These changes would also allow more flexibility in the preparation of test specimens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, NHTSA is concerned that simple substitution of the 1991 version of SAE J576 for the 1970 one might result in
an unintended burden upon industry, as the updated version contains some requirements that are different from and
in addition to those of the 1970 version. In addition, the ASTM D&hyph;1003 requirements currently referenced in
S5.1.2 of Standard No. 108 are those of 1961. NHTSA is proposing to amend S5.1.2 to replace the reference to the 1961
version of ASTM D&hyph;1003 with a 1992 version and seeks comment on this change. The differences between the two versions
include subtle changes to the text in virtually every section and the agency is unable to judge whether these changes
would result in an increased burden to industry. Because of this uncertainty, the agency is proposing as an alternative
a means of implementing DSET's request that does not include a reference to the revised standards. NHTSA welcomes
informed comment on this issue. As a consequence of its age, a 33-year-old ASTM specification may be technologically
limiting, as well as difficult to obtain. As noted above, strict adherence to older procedures which States may require
means that manufacturers could not avail themselves of newer, less restrictive processing techniques if such exist.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, NHTSA is proposing alternative amendments of S5.1.2 as a means of implementing its grant of DSET's petition.
The agency asks commenters for their views on each of the alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would substitute SAE J576 JUL91 for SAE J576c, May 1970, and make conforming amendments in the text
of S5.1.2. This alternative would also replace ASTM D&hyph;1003&hyph;61 with ASTM D&hyph;1003&hyph;92 with respect
to measurement of haze (which, as proposed at 58 FR 13042, would not exceed 7 percent). A specimen thickness tolerance
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.25 mm (0.010 in.) would also be allowed as there is no technical reason to limit the test specimen thickness tolerance
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.005 in., and the value proposed by NHTSA as recommended by DSET appears to be a more reasonable tolerance for test
specimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two new paragraphs would be added, maintaining the performance requirements required of plastic materials by SAE
J576c for the heat test, and specifying positioning of test samples during the test. These have been omitted from J576
JUL91. NHTSA believes the J576c heat test should be retained because the test is the only heat resistance requirement
in Standard No. 108. The test acts to eliminate flagrantly inferior material for reflex reflectors. (Use of material
with insufficient high temperature performance can result in reflectors that lose color and reflectivity.) The
positioning of test samples will allow the sample to droop if its strength is adversely affected by the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This alternative would retain the current SAE and ASTM specifications but would allow processing techniques other
than injection molding to produce equivalent test specimens, test specimens other than a disc of 3-inch diameter,
and a test specimen thickness tolerance of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
0.010 inch.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has determined that it will not review this rulemaking action under Executive
Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking action is not significant under Department of Transportation
regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking action is to update testing procedures. Since
it is not anticipated that the final rule will have any significant cost or other impacts, preparation of a full regulatory
evaluation is not warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. It is not anticipated
that a final rule based on this proposal would have a significant effect upon the environment. The composition of plastic
materials used in optical parts would not change from those presently in production.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and motor vehicle equipment, those affected by the rulemaking action, are generally not small businesses within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would
not be significantly affected because the price of new vehicles and vehicle equipment would not be impacted.

This rulemaking action has also been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive
Order 12612, and NHTSA has determined that this rulemaking action does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

A final rule based on this proposal would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30103, whenever a
Federal motor vehicle safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable
to the same aspect of performance which is not identical to the Federal standard. 49 U.S.C. &sect;30161 sets forth
a procedure for judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
That section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings
before parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) will hold a teleconference on November 14, 1994. The teleconference
will begin at 9 a.m., Alaska local time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary subject of the conference will be possible time/area closures for the groundfish fisheries to protect
red king crab in Bristol Bay. The Council will receive reports on groundfish and crab concentrations and decide if
an emergency rule to implement an area closure is warranted. Possible adjustments to the 1995 recommended vessel
incentive program rate standards for the Bering Sea/Aleutian Island ``other trawl'' category will also be discussed.
Listening sites for the public are being arranged for Anchorage, Homer, Kodiak, Juneau, Sitka, AK, and Seattle, WA.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document recommends changes in the Federal milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing orders for five north-central marketing areas based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry proposals considered at a public hearing. The decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends adopting a plan for pricing milk on the basis of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein and other nonfat solids, as well as butterfat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components. The proposed plan includes adjustments per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight of all producer milk based on the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count of the milk. The intended effect of this rule is to better reflect the value of the nonfat solids components in
the skim portion of milk.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code
and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
amendments would promote orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Adoption of Multiple Component Pricing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals to incorporate multiple component pricing in the Chicago Regional (Order 30), Nebraska-Western Iowa
(Order 65), Upper Midwest (Order 68), Eastern South Dakota (Order 76) and Iowa (Order 79) Federal milk marketing orders
(the five orders) should be adopted, with some modifications. The pricing plan generally would be patterned after
the multiple component pricing plan proposed by National All-Jersey, Inc. and other dairy organizations. Producers
would be paid on the basis of the pounds of butterfat, protein and other nonfat solids (solids-not-fat other than protein)
in their milk, and would share in the value of the pool's Class I and Class II uses on a per hundredweight basis. Regulated
handlers would pay for the milk they receive on the basis of total butterfat, the protein and other nonfat solids used
in Classes II and III, skim milk used in Class I, and the hundredweight of total product used in Classes I and II. A somatic
cell adjustment, per hundredweight, would also apply to payments for all producer milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the present time, milk received by handlers under the five orders is priced according to the pounds of producer milk
allocated to each class of use multiplied by the prices per hundredweight of milk testing 3.5 percent butterfat, as
determined under the orders for each class of use. Adjustments for such items as overage, reclassified inventory,
location and other source milk allocated to Class I are added to or subtracted from the classified use value of the milk.
The resulting amount is divided by the total producer milk in the pool to calculate a price per hundredweight of milk
testing 3.5 percent butterfat to be paid to producers for the milk they have delivered to handlers. The price paid to
each producer is then adjusted according to the specific butterfat test of the producer's milk by means of a butterfat
differential. The butterfat differential is computed by multiplying the wholesale selling price of Grade A (92-score)
bulk butter per pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as reported for the month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
by 0.138 and subtracting the Minnesota-Wisconsin price at test, also as reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
multiplied by .0028.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The multiple component pricing (MCP) plan was originally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for Orders 30, 68 and 79 by National All-Jersey, Inc. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NAJ) and other dairy organizations. In addition, Land O'Lakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inc., proposed that the multiple component plan be considered for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Orders 65 and 76. Most other proposals considered at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were modifications of the NAJ proposal and are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The first NAJ witness stated that the current milk pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system used in the five orders does not meet current marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs and should be replaced with a multiple component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Much of the general NAJ testimony in favor of multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing was later reiterated by witnesses expert in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field of economics and dairy chemistry testifying for NAJ, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative for Land O'Lakes. Also testifying in favor of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAJ proposal were two dairy farmer members of the cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association Swiss Valley Farms Company, a representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brown Swiss Cattle Breeders Association of U.S.A., Inc., and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of Tri-State Milk Cooperative. It was indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in testimony that Alto Dairy Cooperative also supported the NAJ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The representative for the proponents said the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their proposal was to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Use the M-W price as the base; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. Pay all producers on four factors_pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat, pounds of protein, pounds of other solids, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and each producer's share of the fluid differential on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a per hundredweight basis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Leave Class I handler obligations on a skim-butterfat basis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 4. Determine Class II and III handlers' obligations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of pounds of butterfat, protein, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 5. Change only the order provisions needed to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NAJ proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The NAJ witness said that there were five reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing the current milk pricing system with a multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing system. The first reason, according to the NAJ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness, is that the current skim-butterfat pricing system does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not give dairy farmers economic incentives to produce milk high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in nonfat solids, especially protein. He stated that under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current pricing system a pound of water receives the same price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a pound of protein or other solids, yet it is these solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that give milk its functional and nutritional value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The second reason given by the NAJ witness for adopting MCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was that over a period of years much of the value of milk has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shifted from butterfat to the skim portion of milk. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proponent's witness said that in 1960, butterfat represented 77% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the value of the M-W price, and skim represented 23%. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, he testified, these values were reversed, with butterfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing only 23% of the value of the M-W, while the skim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the milk represented 77%. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 According to the NAJ witness, the shift in value from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat to skim was partially caused by the USDA decision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decrease the support price for butter and increase the support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price for nonfat dry milk. The support price for butter declined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from $1.53 per pound in 1981 to 65
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per pound in 1993, with most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the decrease occurring since 1989. Nonfat dry milk purchase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices under the support program increased from 72.75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->
&cent;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per pound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1988 to $1.034 per pound in 1993. In addition, the witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said, the butterfat differential under Federal orders has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dropping since the mid-1980s because of a decline in the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price for butter. This drop was accelerated by a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method of computing the butterfat differential, implemented in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990, that had the impact of reducing the butterfat differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The third reason the witness gave for implementing multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing was the shift in types of dairy products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers are purchasing. According to the witness, some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline in butterfat value relative to skim value has been caused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a shift in consumption from whole milk to lowfat and skim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fluid milk products. The witness presented data to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 1970 to 1991, national fluid milk sales of lowfat and skim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk increased 232%, while sales of whole milk declined 50%. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, he stated, consumption of lowfat manufactured products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is growing faster than consumption of relatively high-fat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The NAJ witness discussed equity in Federal orders as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fourth reason for implementing multiple component pricing. He 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said that the current skim-butterfat pricing system is equitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for neither producers nor handlers since it does not properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize the value of protein, especially in manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products such as cheese. The witness provided examples to show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how a producer with high protein milk may currently receive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same Federal order minimum price as a producer with low protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk. Similarly, a cheese maker who purchases high protein milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have a cost advantage at minimum order prices over a cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maker who purchases low protein milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The fifth reason presented by the NAJ witness was the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of a number of voluntary multiple component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans in the areas covered by the five orders. Data were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented to show that nearly all producers in the five orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently are eligible to be paid under one of these voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple component pricing plans. The witness stated that many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the plans have inadequacies which contribute to disorderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing. According to the witness, these inadequacies would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by adopting the NAJ proposal.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A witness from Land O'Lakes, Inc. (LOL), testified in support of the adoption of MCP in the five orders in general, and
the NAJ proposal specifically. He discussed how the NAJ multiple component pricing proposal would better reflect
the market value of nutrients in the milk to the farmer. He stated that the proposed system, compared with the current
system, would essentially eliminate the value of milk used in manufacturing that is currently associated with water
which, he said, has very little market value in dairy products. The witness said that MCP would affect the cost of milk
to LOL as a handler in that it will come closer to equalizing the cost of milk relative to the value of the products derived
from the milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The LOL witness also described four major weaknesses in the existing voluntary MCP plans. The first weakness, he said,
was that the current plans emphasize component test instead of component yield. He said that the price paid to each
producer should be tied more directly to the value of the products that can be produced from the producer's milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second weakness described by the LOL witness is that many existing plans do not provide for deductions for milk
with low component levels. This, he said, indicates that the plans recognize the higher value of milk with more pounds
of components, but do not recognize that milk with fewer pounds of components is worth less. He said that competitive,
rather than economic, factors are the reason deductions for low component levels generally do not exist, as many producers
do not like to see deductions on their milk checks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the LOL witness, an inequitable feature of the voluntary MCP plans is that they generally pay no component
premiums when the somatic cell count of the milk is above a fixed level, resulting in high test producers losing their
component premium because of high somatic cells, while low test producers with high somatic cell counts lose nothing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth weakness described by the witness is that some existing MCP plans pay premiums for protein, while others
pay premiums for solids-not-fat. He said that most producers in Wisconsin receive premiums based on protein, while
most producers in Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota receive premiums based on solids-not-fat. The witness
claimed that the variety of payment plans currently in existence do a poor job of transmitting market signals to the
producers, are not economically consistent, and lead to confusion among farmers. He said that the NAJ proposal would
address the deficiencies in the current situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most participants at the hearing advocated the introduction of MCP for payments to producers and for milk delivered
to handlers for Class II and Class III use in the five orders. There was no support for pricing Class I milk on other than
the current butterfat and skim basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to NAJ and LOL, adoption of some form of multiple component pricing in the five orders was supported by Central
Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP), Farmers Union Milk Marketing
Cooperative (FUMMC), National Farmers Organization (NFO), Kraft General Foods (Kraft), Associated Milk Producers,
Inc., North Central Region (AMPI North Central), Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association (WCMA), Dean Foods, and National
Cheese Institute (NCI).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CMPC witnesses strongly supported the need for implementing multiple component pricing in the five orders and
proposed a plan very similar to that of NAJ. The fundamental difference between the two plans is that the CMPC proposal
would result in lower protein prices than the NAJ proposal. The appropriate level of the protein price is discussed
under Issue 3a below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CMPC proposal was supported in testimony and in a post-hearing brief by NFO. A witness for WCMA testified in support
of the CMPC proposal for multiple component pricing. A witness for Dean Foods testified in support of the concept of
MCP, and in response to a question about which proposal he favored, he expressed support for the CMPC proposal. AMPI
North Central Region submitted a brief in support of the CMPC proposal for multiple component pricing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A witness for NCI testified in support of the CMPC multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing proposal with one primary modification. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCI proposal would calculate a ``residual fluid price'', instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an other solids price. This proposal is discussed further under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue 3b below in this decision. Kraft testified and submitted a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brief in support of the NCI proposal for multiple component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for the Trade Association of Proprietary Plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TAPP) and Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testified in support of the TAPP proposal, a variation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMPC proposal that would price both butterfat and protein on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential basis, rather than on a per pound basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five north central Federal milk orders included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding should be amended to include multiple component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing. On the basis of the record of this proceeding, multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing would entail pricing milk on the basis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds of butterfat, protein and other nonfat solids contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the milk, with a somatic cell adjustment to the hundredweight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price paid to producers. The record indicates that a large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of the producers pooled under these orders are already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible for or receive some form of multiple component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that many of these component pricing plans use protein as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The record also shows that the diverse component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs that currently exist promote disorderly and inefficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing conditions in the procurement of milk supplies by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competing handlers. The different programs establish non-uniform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bases of payments to producers. The adoption of multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing will allow the Orders to recognize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional value of milk with a higher-than-average solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the five orders included in this proceeding, the vast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of the milk pooled is utilized in manufactured products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total solids in the milk used for manufacturing are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary determinants of product yield. In addition, it is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids in fluid milk that give it its nutritional value and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taste. In both types of products, the current pricing system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in the five orders does not properly recognize the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfat milk solids, nor encourage producers to increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of nonfat milk solids in the milk they produce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the shift in value in recent years from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat portion of milk to the skim portion, most of the value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of milk is determined on a volume basis without any consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the value of the skim components. Adoption of the multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing plan recommended in this decision will enable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the market to reflect the value of the skim components in milk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to butterfat, protein is clearly the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate component of milk on which payment should be based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the milk pooled under these five orders is used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing, and 86% of the milk used in manufacturing is used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to produce cheese. Because protein is a main determinant of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese yield, and it is cheese that determines the profitability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for most of the dairy industry in the 5-market area, the milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing system should recognize the value of the protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of milk as it is used in the manufacture of cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Record evidence clearly shows that protein has a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand than other components of milk because of its functional, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritional and economic value in the marketplace. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional characteristics of protein allow it to form the matrix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the production of cheese and yogurt. Protein is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to the air formation in the manufacture of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and provides some required nutrients in the human diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milk containing a higher percentage of protein will result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater yields of most manufactured products than milk with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower protein test. Additionally, handlers receiving milk that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in greater volumes of finished products such as cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cottage cheese than an equivalent volume of milk testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower in protein should be required to pay more for the higher-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing milk. At the same time, the dairy farmer producing milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that yields greater amounts of finished products deserves to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid more for it than a dairy farmer producing the same volume of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk that results in less product yield. Thus, sending an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic signal to dairy farmers will encourage them to maximize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the production of those components which have the greatest demand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to analysis of the record, proponents are correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that attribution of all of the skim value of the M-W price to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein would result in an overstatement of the value of protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in cheese and most other uses. In order to maintain fairly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform prices between orders for milk used in manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, it is necessary to assign the residual value of the M-W 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price minus the butterfat and protein values to either other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A witness for the Galloway Company testified in support of TAPP and Galloway's own proposals to exclude sweetened
condensed milk, ice cream and ice cream mix from pricing under a multiple component pricing system. The witness stated
that such products should continue to be priced under the current pricing system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Galloway witness said that some Class II manufactured products, together with other products such as sour cream,
whipping cream, half and half, eggnog, yogurt, nonfat dry milk and butter, are not affected in yield by the protein
content of the milk from which the products are manufactured. Instead, according to the witness, it is total skim solids
that affect the yield of these products. Accordingly, the witness stated, it would not be equitable to price such products
under a multiple component pricing system which prices protein at a level higher than the remaining skim solids in
the milk. The witness argued that these products should be left out of any MCP plan adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Galloway witness testified, and post-hearing briefs filed on behalf of Anderson-Erickson (A&hyph;E) and Galloway
asserted, that yields are affected by the level of total skim solids rather than protein, making the pricing of protein
irrelevant for Class II pricing. The Galloway witness testified that there have been months in which the monthly average
protein level and other nonfat solids level of milk moved in opposite directions. In addition, the A&hyph;E and Galloway
briefs asserted that MCP would significantly increase the cost of Class II milk, which would put them at an even greater
disadvantage than currently with respect to products made from nonfat dry milk priced at the Class III-A price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Galloway witness stated that the primary product manufactured by the Galloway Company is sweetened condensed
milk. According to the witness, this product competes on a national basis with other manufacturers who do not have
to procure their milk under Federal orders with MCP provisions. The witness stated that it would be unfair to force
his organization to procure milk under a set of regulations that differ from those regulating his competitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A portion of the TAPP proposal would require a classification change for sweetened condensed milk from Class II to
Class III. Although the Galloway witness expressed strong concern over the impact of multiple component pricing
on his company, the effect of the classification of sweetened condensed milk on the Galloway company is not part of
the MCP issue. Reclassification of this product is a separate issue that was discussed thoroughly at a previous hearing,
and in the decision issued as a result of that hearing (58 FR 27774). No new evidence was presented at this hearing that
would justify reclassifying sweetened condensed milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milk used to produce sweetened condensed milk, or any other Class II product, should not be exempted from multiple
component pricing. The MCP plan recommended for adoption will cover all Class II and Class III products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony at the hearing indicated that there are essentially two groups of Class II products that differ with respect
to the impact of multiple component pricing on the handlers that make these products. The first group of Class II products
are those in which there generally seemed to be agreement in the hearing record that yields are greatly affected by
the level of protein in the milk. These products include the various cottage cheeses and other similar soft, high-moisture
cheeses. The handlers that make these products benefit directly from higher levels of protein in milk and should be
accountable to the pool for this added benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second group of Class II products are those where there was some disagreement in the record about the affect of protein
on the yield. These products include ice cream and frozen desserts and mixes, fluid creams, sour creams, yogurt, sweetened
condensed milk and others. Considerable debate took place on whether it was appropriate to include these products
in a multiple component pricing system.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Occurrences of average protein level and other nonfat solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of milk moving in opposite directions appears to be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exception rather than the rule. Evidence presented in ``Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Component Levels and Somatic Cell Counts in Individual Herd 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milk at the Farm Level, 1992, Upper Midwest Marketing Area'', 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that about 60% of the variation in solids-not-fat is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by variation in protein, and that higher protein levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are positively correlated with higher solids-not-fat levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data presented in this and other documents show that the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other solids in milk tends to be relatively constant with, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally, small month-to-month variation. Thus, when a handler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchases milk with higher than average protein levels, he will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also, generally, be purchasing milk with higher than average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of solids-not-fat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the sum of the value of the protein and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids under this recommended pricing plan equals the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the total nonfat solids. The value of total nonfat solids, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, is a weighted average of the quantity and price of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein and the quantity and price of the other nonfat solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in the milk. Analysis based on the average tests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the five markets shows that under the recommended pricing plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of total nonfat solids would range from approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$.002 per pound below the current value to approximately $.008 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per pound above the current value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This estimated price difference is certainly not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant increase that is claimed in the briefs. In hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony, the Galloway witness stated that an analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of the CMPC proposal on the Galloway Company showed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nine-cent increase per hundredweight in the cost of Galloway's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk only when the CMPC somatic cell adjustment was included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without the somatic cell adjustment, the analysis showed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of milk to Galloway would be reduced under the CMPC multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is appropriate to include all Class II products in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple component pricing system being proposed here. All 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class II products derive benefit from butterfat, protein and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other solids in the milk. The benefit may be in enhanced yield, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as protein for cottage cheese, or a combination of protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other solids (i.e. the solids-not-fat in the milk) in many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other Class II products. Or, the benefit may be in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other area. For example, the NAJ dairy chemist witness testified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the importance of protein in the functionality of many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products, such as in ice cream, whipping cream, and yogurt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some testimony even went so far as to discuss the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein in fluid milk, in terms of the nutrient content and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral carrying content of the milk. However, since there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no substantial support for including Class I milk in the multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing system being proposed here, only Class II and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III products will be priced on multiple components.

2. Orders To Be Included
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to incorporate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple component pricing plan adopted in this proceeding in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern South Dakota Federal milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders as well as in the Chicago Regional, Iowa, and Upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Midwest orders should be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for Land O'Lakes (LOL), proponent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, listed a number of reasons for including the multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing plan in the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota orders as well as in the orders proposed by NAJ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness explained that all five orders are similar in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their predominant use of milk is for manufacturing Class III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. He testified that the primary organizations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern South Dakota markets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also are major participants in one or more of the Chicago 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional, Iowa, and Upper Midwest order marketing areas. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness stated that inclusion of the Nebraska-Western Iowa and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eastern South Dakota orders in the multiple component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan would allow those organizations that have producers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market milk in multiple orders to standardize their payrolls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
billings, thus maintaining uniformity and reducing confusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among producers and handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to include additional orders in this decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be made entirely on the basis of convenience to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties marketing milk on the various orders. The decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on whether inclusion of the two orders would tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectuate the policy of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Certainly, including the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota orders in this decision will contribute to orderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data supplied by the market administrators' offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing the milksheds of the various orders shows a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable overlap of milksheds. For example, many South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dakota counties have milk pooled on three of the five orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the same month. In the absence of uniform pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions between the five orders, disorderly marketing could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur, particularly when orders have overlapping milksheds, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one order were pricing milk on a skim and butterfat basis while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another order was pricing milk on the basis of its components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a producer's milk tests high for nonfat components but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pooled under an order that prices milk on a skim-butterfat basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the producer would attempt to maximize returns by changing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market under which his milk is pooled to benefit from his high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component levels. The opposite situation would occur if the milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a producer testing below average for nonfat components is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pooled under an order with MCP provisions. Such a producer would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize returns by changing the order under which his milk is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pooled to one with skim-butterfat pricing. This shuffling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers in the same geographic area because of nonuniform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing provisions would not constitute orderly marketing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the inclusion of the Nebraska-Western Iowa and Eastern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Dakota orders in the multiple component pricing decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would tend to reduce disorderly marketing in the region, benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers by allowing a standardized payroll, and there was no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposition to their inclusion, multiple component pricing should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be adopted for these two orders as well as the other three.

3. Components and Component Prices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unlike the multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing plans adopted previously in other Federal milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing orders, this decision recommends the adoption of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing plan for milk based on three components rather than two. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the five orders involved in this decision, milk should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priced on the basis of its protein, other nonfat solids, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protein price contained in this decision is based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of protein in the manufacture of cheese, as determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese market prices, and is not a residual of the Minnesota- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin (M-W) price minus butterfat value as is the case in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other MCP plans. The butterfat price would be based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butter market, as it is in other multiple component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. ``Other nonfat solids'' will be priced as a residual of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the M-W price minus protein value and butterfat value. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat, protein, and other nonfat solids prices shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed in dollars per pound carried to the fourth decimal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. In addition, payments to each producer should reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of participation in the marketwide pools on a hundredweight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in other orders for which multiple component pricing has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been adopted, this decision maintains the relationship of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of producer milk to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
M-W price. If the sum of the butterfat value and the protein value is greater than the M-W price, a situation which would
result in a negative other nonfat solids price, the protein price will be adjusted such that the other nonfat solids
price will be zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In testimony and brief a witness for the Trade Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Proprietary Plants (TAPP) and Farmers Union Milk Marketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooperative (FUMMC) presented a plan that would pay producers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein above a neutral zone of 3.00% to 3.29%, and provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deductions for protein levels below the neutral zone. The level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of adjustment would be tied to the price of barrel cheddar cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the National Cheese Exchange, and would be used to adjust pay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices to producers in a manner similar to the current butterfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness said that milk traditionally has been purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a per hundredweight basis, with differential adjustments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of components. According to the witness, not only are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers usually paid on a per hundredweight basis, but milk is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured on a per hundredweight basis for purposes of plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounting, payments between plants and to haulers, and by breed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations and DHIA with adjustments for percentages of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components where necessary. The witness also claimed that using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential pricing would be revenue neutral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TAPP/FUMMC witness is correct that switching payments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers from a per hundredweight system to one of pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, as adopted in this decision, is not a minor change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some expense will be incurred by handlers and producers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adapting to the new system. However, the benefits to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry in the affected areas of adopting a uniform multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing system outweigh the one-time costs of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adoption. The implication that everyone connected with the dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry must adopt this system is not correct. Pounds of milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must still be accounted for under the multiple component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. For example, nothing in this decision would prevent a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler from continuing to pay haulers on a hundredweight basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No testimony at the hearing from witnesses that have producers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pooled under Federal orders that have already adopted multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component pricing indicated that moving to a pricing system that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices milk component by the pound was an onerous burden. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transcript does reveal disagreement with the level of the protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price under some Federal orders with multiple component pricing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but little dissatisfaction with the system itself, nor complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the difficulty of switching to a component pricing system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the argument that pricing protein and butterfat on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of price differentials would be revenue neutral, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple component pricing system recommended for adoption is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed neither to enhance nor reduce total producer returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only changes in the total pool value that may occur because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the recommended changes would result from differences in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein and other nonfat solids content between milk pooled under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the orders included in this proceeding and the milk included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Minnesota-Wisconsin survey. In addition, some redistribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the dollars involved in each pool can be expected between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers, and between handlers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal by TAPP and FUMMC to leave butterfat on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential pricing basis and to price protein on a differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis with a neutral range is not included in this decision. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to pay producers for butterfat and to add payment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein on the ``traditional'' differential system would confuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and frustrate producers in the understanding of their milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks. Continued use of differentials would perpetuate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume-based pricing system with a high value on water, and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail to give producers a true price signal of what the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace wants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of differentials in pricing milk components is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widely understood. There is no valid reason to continue an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outmoded and confusing pricing system in valuing milk components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pricing components on a per-pound basis will allow producers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
see clearly what components have the most value, a result which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plainly fits the goal of encouraging producers to produce those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components which have the highest value in the market place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Per-pound pricing also makes clear to producers that it is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds of components that result in payment, rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentages of those components in milk. Producers would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
better able to look at the cost of producing pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, and compare those costs with possible returns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of a neutral zone would discourage producers from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing protein production marginally unless such an increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would raise the protein level above the neutral range.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The protein price for milk pooled under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five north central Federal milk orders should be calculated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplying the monthly average of 40-pound block cheese prices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the Green Bay Cheese Exchange by 1.32, without including a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value for whey protein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No opposition was expressed at the hearing to pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein on the basis of its value in the manufacture of cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The differences between participants came in determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate level of the protein price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal submitted and supported by National All-Jersey, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inc. (NAJ), and supported by a number of cooperative associations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other dairy organizations, would calculate the protein price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in two parts: (1) Multiply the National Cheese Exchange monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average 40-pound block cheese price by 1.32, and (2) add the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly average whey protein concentrate price multiplied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
.735. The sum of these two values would equal the protein price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NAJ proponent witness explained that one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives of the NAJ proposal was to establish a protein price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that was high enough to give producers an incentive to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein. He added that a second objective was to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein price from market forces rather than as a residual value, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as is used in other Federal orders. The witness explained that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1.32 factor used in the NAJ proposal comes from the modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Van Slyke cheese yield formula that is commonly used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. The 1.32 factor represents the pounds of 38-percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moisture Cheddar cheese obtained from one pound of protein with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75 percent of the protein going into the cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness gave four reasons for using the National Cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exchange 40-pound Cheddar block price (block price): (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
majority of the cheese in the five Federal orders is priced using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the block price as the base price, (2) the block price is used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the somatic cell adjustment in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio Valley orders,
as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being used in the computation of the Class II price in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal orders, and in the determination of the Class 4a price in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California, (3) since there is over twice as much American cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured in blocks as is made in barrels, and the Wisconsin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly point barrel cheese price is within one cent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
block price, the block price represents a minimum cheese price, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (4) the protein price determined pursuant to this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gives a greater incentive to producers to produce protein and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more equitable to handlers and producers than the (lower) protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price contained in the other proposals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NAJ witness continued by explaining that the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the value of whey protein in the protein price so that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the protein in the milk would be accounted for. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained by the proponent witness, the .735 factor was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by dividing 25 percent, which is the protein left in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whey after making cheese, by 34 percent, which is the percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein in whey protein concentrate. The resulting value, .735, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is multiplied by the monthly average 34 percent whey protein concentrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price to yield the whey contribution to the protein price. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness stated that the whey protein concentrate price was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected because it is a better indicator of the value of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein contained in whey than is dry whey or animal feed whey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An economist supporting the NAJ proposal testified that even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though the butterfat price is determined at its marginal value, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, the value of butterfat in butter, the protein price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be determined by the value of protein in the most common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of protein in the five markets included in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness pointed out that the most common use of protein is in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacture of cheese, with 85.9 percent of the milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketed in 1992 in Wisconsin being used in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese. The witness testified that the appropriate cheese price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be used in computing the protein price was the block price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it is a ``conservative estimate of the price actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received for block cheddar cheese''. The witness went on to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explain that the reported block price is closer to what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing plants receive for barrel cheese than is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported barrel price because when the customary premiums are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to the reported barrel cheese price the result is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately equal to the block price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The academic NAJ witness reiterated the NAJ position that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the value of whey protein should be included in the protein price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the total value of the protein in producer milk would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus be reflected in the protein price, giving producers an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentive to produce more protein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that the CMPC proposal would use the monthly average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Green Bay Cheese Exchange barrel price (barrel price) instead of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the block price, and would not include the value of whey protein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness for CMPC testified that the barrel price better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the value of cheese than the block price because there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a greater volume of trading in barrel cheese than in block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese. The resulting protein price would be lower than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein price computed under the NAJ proposal. A witness for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMPC explained that their proposed protein price was based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding that Federal order prices are minimum prices, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the CMPC proposal, using the barrel cheese price and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including a value for whey protein, would result in a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price for protein.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CMPC protein price proposal was supported at the hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by other hearing participants, including National Farmers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organization (NFO), Kraft, Inc., Galloway Co., Wisconsin Cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Makers Association (WCMA), National Cheese Institute (NCI), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farmers Union Milk Marketing Cooperative (FUMMC), and the Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Proprietary Plants (TAPP). A witness for NCI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that if the protein price is set at too high a level, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese manufacturers would experience a declining gross margin as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the price for protein increases above the return the plant can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain from additional protein. He explained that this would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case with the protein price as proposed by NAJ, but not with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NCI and CMPC proposed protein price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other witnesses supporting a lower protein price than that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by NAJ explained that protein should not be priced at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high level because the higher price may disadvantage handlers who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not manufacture cheese. They testified that the higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein price would not be recoverable in certain products such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as nonfat dry milk, condensed milk, or certain Class II products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that even though the lower protein price still may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recoverable, it offers the best alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Galloway witness stated that if a multiple component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing plan that derives a protein price from a cheese market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value were adopted, the protein price should represent a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value, should be based on the barrel cheese market, and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not include a value for whey protein concentrate. He argued that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a price would have the impact of minimizing the difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the protein and other solids prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TAPP/FUMMC witness testified that protein should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priced at a level somewhat below its full value in cheddar cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and whey for several reasons. He said that too high a protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price could invite the use of non-dairy protein, whey solids, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
casein, and thereby cause an increase in the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imitation cheese. He also said that since some Class II and III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products do not recoup as much value from high protein milk as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese and cottage cheese, the protein price should be set at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level less than its full value for cheese. The witness expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern that too high a protein price could result in a zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value for the residual component, or other solids. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the witness, a zero value for the residual would fail to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a realistic value, and would not cover a make allowance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the post-hearing brief filed by NAJ, the position of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using a ``justifiably high'' protein price to send a signal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers that protein is the most valuable component in milk was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reiterated. In post hearing briefs filed by CMPC, NFO, Kraft, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCI, TAPP and FUMMC, Anderson-Erickson (A-E), and AMPI North 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Central Region, the computation of the protein price as proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by CMPC was supported. The reasons given in testimony for using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lower protein price than that proposed by NAJ were reiterated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in briefs. In addition, A-E, Kraft and AMPI North Central Region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argued that the difference between the barrel cheese price and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the block cheese price is due to the cost of packaging and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonmilk factors, and therefore the barrel cheese price should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for determining the protein price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In pure economic terms the price of a product represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply and demand for that product as affected by place, form, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and time. The problem with determining a price for protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in milk is that the protein is not marketed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate unique product, but is marketed as an integral part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both fluid and manufactured dairy products. Therefore, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining an appropriate protein price, the value of protein in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy products is determined by using the value of a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose yield is a function of the protein content of the milk. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this point in time no attempt is made to reflect the protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of milk in the value of milk used for fluid use. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this reason, the component pricing plan recommended in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision does not apply to milk used for Class I purposes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The level of protein in milk does have a measurable affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the value of milk used for manufacturing. This value varies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the diverse manufactured products because of differences in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the market values of manufactured dairy products and in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribution made by protein to various finished products. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance, testimony at the hearing showed that for a one-pound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in protein in the manufacture of cheddar cheese there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.32 pound change in the quantity of cheese produced, whereas in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the production of milk powder a one-pound change in the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein would change the amount of powder produced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately one pound. Since the vast majority of milk in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five orders included in this hearing is used to manufacture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese, the protein price will be based on the contribution made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by protein in the manufacture of cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1.32 factor used in both methods proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the protein price for these five orders is derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a modified Van Slyke cheese yield formula, where the casein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is assumed to be 75 percent of the protein and the moisture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of the cheese is 38 percent. Assuming the butterfat is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constant, a change of protein by one pound in this formula will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change cheese yield by 1.32 pounds. Therefore, the 1.32 factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is appropriate for determining the order protein price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the level of the protein price, the question 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of whether to use the average block price versus the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrel price is a lesser issue than the question of whether or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not whey protein should be included in the computation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein price, as proposed by NAJ. The average difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Green Bay Cheese Exchange average block price and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average barrel price during 1992 and 1993 was $.0388 per pound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Multiplying this difference by the 1.32 factor results in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average difference of $.05 per pound of protein between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein prices derived from the barrel and the block cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices. Over the same 2 years the inclusion of whey protein in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the computation of the protein price would have increased the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein price by an average of $.4265. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal issues that must be addressed in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the computation of the protein price are the factors that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included to arrive at a price that most accurately reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of protein in milk. In addition, the effect of the level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the protein price on the other nonfat solids price must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. Since the other nonfat solids price is computed as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price, the other nonfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids price is inversely related to the protein price. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining an appropriate protein price and other nonfat solids 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price, the effects of both prices on payments to producers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margins to handlers buying milk must be determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inclusion of a protein price and an other solids price in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining payments to producers gives producers an incentive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase their production of nonfat solids, especially protein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was no evidence in the hearing record to indicate the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to producers of increasing the protein content of milk. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore difficult to determine what the absolute level of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein price, or its relative level to the butterfat and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids prices, must be to encourage producers to increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein content of milk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On average for the 21 months of data available in the record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protein price recommended for adoption in this decision, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$1.6851 per pound of protein, is twice both the $.6379 per pound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average other solids price and the $.8374 per pound average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat price. Certainly, pricing protein at double the price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the other components in milk gives producers a clear message 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that protein is the component most desired in the marketplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without over-valuing that component. The significant difference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in prices between protein and the other nonfat solids and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat components should give producers an incentive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase protein output. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony by several proponents of component pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that component pricing would be more equitable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers than the current skim-butterfat pricing system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proponents explained that the increased equity would be due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers paying for milk based more closely on its economic value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to them. This increased equity is reflected in a narrower spread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in margins between handlers making cheese from low protein-low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids milk versus handlers making cheese from high protein-high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids milk. Several exhibits showed that handlers using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``average'' milk would experience little if any change in their net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margins. However, handlers using low-testing milk would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience a higher net margin than under the present pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan, while handlers using high-testing milk would experience a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower net margin. This result, the narrowing of handlers' net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margins when compared to the skim-butterfat pricing system, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur no matter which of the proposed pricing plans is used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price the components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis of data presented at the hearing, using price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computations based on each of the proposals and averaged over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 months of data included in exhibits, shows a range of net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing margins for cheese using the recommended pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system of $1.57 per hundredweight compared with the $3.34 range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cheese manufacturing margins per hundredweight of milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased attributable to the current skim-butterfat pricing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. The three component pricing plans discussed at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing would result in ranges in net cheese manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margins of $1.16 per hundredweight for the NAJ proposal, $1.62 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per hundredweight for the CMPC proposal, and $1.70 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight for the NCI proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the NAJ proposal yielded the smallest spread in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net margins, further analysis of the NAJ results shows that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net margins increase and then start to decline. The decline in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
margins occurs when there is not enough butterfat in the milk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully utilize the protein available, thus reducing the increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in cheese yield as protein content continues to increase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, if the price of protein is greater than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased return from cheese, the net return will start to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decline in net returns under the NAJ proposal indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the NAJ proposal would overprice protein, at least when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is not enough butterfat to fully utilize the protein. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result is that the marginal return using the NAJ proposal peaks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the protein and butterfat range of average milk while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marginal return using the protein and other solids price as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended in this decision continues to increase, although at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreasing rate. A mandated pricing system should not set prices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at levels that result in a declining marginal return, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly when the decline occurs at or near average market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component levels. Therefore, the whey protein factor should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in the computation of the protein price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monthly average price for 40-pound block cheddar cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin, is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate price to use for determining the protein price. Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the block price results in producers receiving a higher price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for protein than if the barrel price were used without handlers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurring any significantly higher cost for milk. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the record showed that more cars of barrel cheese were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold on the Exchange than block cheese, the predominant cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form in which American cheese is manufactured in the five-market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region is in 40-pound or 640-pound blocks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The price difference between block and barrel cheese may be due to packaging and other nonmilk factors. However, the
protein price must be established at a level that best meets the needs of all concerned. The block cheese price should
be more effective than the barrel price in establishing a sufficiently high protein price to accomplish the goal of
encouraging producers to produce protein without having a detrimental impact on handlers, and does result in a narrower
range of manufacturing margins for cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the period January 1992 through September 1993, a protein price computed by multiplying the block price by 1.32
would have resulted in an average protein price of $1.6851 per pound. The CMPC and NCI proposals, using the barrel cheese
price, would have resulted in an average protein price of $1.6337 per pound of protein over the same time period. A comparison
of the net margins resulting from the recommended protein price versus the CMPC and NCI proposals shows that the slightly
higher protein price and correspondingly lower other solids price recommended herein have a negligible affect on
net margins. In fact, the spread between the highest and lowest cheese manufacturing margin declines slightly while
the margin per pound of cheese remains virtually unchanged. At the same time, the producer is paid a higher protein
price and thereby has a greater incentive to increase protein production.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The balance of the M-W price, after the values of protein and butterfat are removed, should be priced on the basis of
``other nonfat solids.'' The other nonfat solids price per pound will be computed by subtracting from the Class III
price the sum of the butterfat price times 3.5 and the protein price times the test of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price
survey milk. The result will be divided by the other nonfat solids test of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey milk.
Because the computation of the other solids price is based on a residual value, the other solids price could be negative
without further adjustments. Therefore, if computation of the other solids price results in a negative price, the
protein price will be adjusted (downward) to result in a zero value for the other solids price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a residual, a NAJ witness stated, the other nonfat solids price would represent the value of lactose and ash, which
are the primary constituents of the other nonfat solids, and the difference in value between a competitively set price
for milk, the Minnesota-Wisconsin price, and the value of that milk based strictly on product prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An expert witness for NAJ testified that a higher price for other solids than would be computed by using a protein price
lower than that proposed by NAJ was not justified because a higher other nonfat solids price would defeat the purpose
of multiple component pricing: To give producers an economic incentive to increase the protein content of their milk.
The witness also explained that since the ``other nonfat solids'' consist primarily of lactose, for which there is
a limited market and cheaper substitutes, there is no reason to have a high other nonfat solids price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for CMPC explained that the CMPC proposal would result in a higher price for other nonfat solids than the NAJ
proposal. The witness testified that reduced emphasis on the protein price and increased emphasis on the other solids
price would reduce the impact of multiple component pricing on handlers and producers. The witness observed that
the average difference in handlers' cost of milk between the current skim-butterfat pricing system and the CMPC proposal
was less than one cent per hundredweight, while the NAJ proposal would result in a difference of slightly over three
cents per hundredweight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CMPC witness pointed out that the same relationship was applicable to returns to producers. In fact, the witness
stated, when comparing the effect of the current skim-butterfat pricing system on handlers' obligations with both
the NAJ proposal and the CMPC proposal, there is a narrower spread from the highest difference to the lowest difference
and a smaller standard deviation with the CMPC proposal than the equivalent comparisons with the NAJ proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative residual price was proposed by NCI and supported by Kraft. A witness for NCI testified that instead
of placing the residual value on the other nonfat solids, the residual value should be placed on the remaining pounds
of fluid milk. The witness explained that this residual fluid price would be calculated by subtracting the value of
3.5 pounds of butterfat and the value of the protein based on the protein test of the milk in the Minnesota-Wisconsin
price survey from the Minnesota-Wisconsin price. The resulting value would be divided by 100 minus 3.5 minus the protein
test of the milk in the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCI witness testified that placing the residual value on other nonfat solids would yield an ``other nonfat solids''
price that could not be recovered in the marketplace. In addition, he stated, although the butterfat price is based
on the butter market and the protein price would be based on the return to cheese manufacture, the other nonfat solids
price would have no relationship to any particular established market or component. The witness also testified that
since an other nonfat solids test would not be needed for the NCI proposal, administration of the pricing plan would
be easier and less expensive than the other pricing proposals.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal by NCI to place the residual value on a ``fluid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carrier'' component has some merit in that it does not try to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply the residual value to a component such as other solids, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the market may not place a value. The major drawback to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NCI proposal is that it ignores one of the components of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk, other nonfat solids, which is composed of lactose and ash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the other nonfat solids do not have as much market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value as either butterfat or protein, they are an important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of milk. If a multiple component pricing system is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be effective it should price as many of the components in milk as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible, preferably based on the value of those components in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the marketplace. There is, however, no readily available measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the market value of the other nonfat solids. Since there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no testimony or any justification in the record for departing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the Minnesota-Wisconsin price as a basic price for milk, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least one of the components in the payment plan must represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the difference between a competitively-set pay price (the M-W) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the product-derived component prices. This residual value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore represents not only the value of the lactose and ash, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but also equates the component values, some of which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by their market value, with a competitively set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer pay price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prospect of lactose being added to milk by producers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purpose of benefitting from the other solids price was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed by several hearing participants. The incentive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterate milk with added lactose should be no more of a problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the current incentive to adulterate milk with water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing to determine whether lactose has been added should, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact, be easier than testing for water since it would be part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the testing necessary to determine producers' payments. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, added lactose can be detected during normal testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures currently conducted on milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCI's concern that testing for total solids would increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers' costs and difficulty of testing was not established in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hearing record. In fact, testimony indicated that many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers are already testing for total solids. Hearing testimony 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also showed that the testing for total solids is as accurate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accurate than testing for butterfat or protein. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the infrared machines that are used by most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratories will test for total solids at the same time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat and protein tests are done. Therefore, there should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no significant increase in testing cost or testing difficulty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the implementation of the component pricing plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Butterfat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The value of butterfat in the amended orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be the same as under the current orders. There was no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal or testimony to change the way butterfat currently is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valued. One expert witness testified that the current system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basing the value of butterfat on the value of butter is proper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision continues the historical relationship of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values of butterfat and butter. The difference between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing of butterfat in the amended order and the current order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is due to the way that value is expressed. Currently the value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of butterfat is expressed as a differential; that is, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference in value between 0.1 pound of butterfat and 0.1 pound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of skim milk. The amended order will express the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
butterfat on the basis of a price per pound. Whichever method is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, the total value of butterfat in milk is the same. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by expressing the value on a per pound basis instead of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential, the objective of demonstrating clearly to producers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the value is in milk is easily achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, the butterfat price per pound in the amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order will be determined by multiplying the butterfat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential by 965 and adding the Class III price. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting price per hundredweight would then be divided by 100 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
give a price per pound of butterfat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Miscellaneous
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The three component prices: butterfat, protein, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other solids, will be expressed on a per pound basis with four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places to the right of the decimal. Analysis has shown that by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressing these prices to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accuracy of the prices is significantly enhanced over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressing the prices to the nearest cent. Additionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between what is paid into the producer settlement fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and what is drawn from the producer settlement fund is much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closer to zero than when prices are rounded to the nearest full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to other orders that have multiple component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pricing provisions, this decision incorporates only one protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price as well as one other nonfat solids price. The pooling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the components to include the Class I skim portion is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated within the computation of the producer price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential. This feature of the pricing plan allows for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination of separate handler and producer protein prices and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate handler and producer other solids prices, and resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion over which price, handler or producer, should be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when. In addition, a handler's per pound price for protein or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other solids is the same whether the handler is buying milk from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers or from other handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The producer price differential, which represents the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional value of Class I and Class II milk in the pool and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive or negative effect of Class III&hyph;A, will be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing for each handler, and then accumulating for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers, the differential value (from Class III) of the Class I, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class II, and Class III&hyph;A product pounds. The differential value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is adjusted, when appropriate, for shrinkage and overage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inventory reclassification, receipts of other source milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocated as Class I, receipts from unregulated supply plants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location adjustments, and, in the Chicago Regional order, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation and assembly credits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of eliminating differences between handler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and producer component values, the value of the Class I skim milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the values of the protein and other solids contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skim milk allocated to Class II and Class III will be added to, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the values of the protein and other solids contained in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer milk subtracted from, the differential pool. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulated total for all handlers is then adjusted by total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer location adjustments and one-half the unobligated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balance in the producer settlement fund. The resulting value is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then divided by the total pounds of producer milk in the pool, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and an amount not less than four cents nor more than five cents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is deducted. The result is the producer price differential to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paid to producers on a per hundredweight basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible for the producer price differential to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative. A negative producer price differential can result for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two reasons. Any of the Class I, II, or III&hyph;A differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices may be negative and/or the minus adjustments may be large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to offset any positive contribution from the differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price. A negative producer price differential would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to a uniform price less than the Class III price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An issue that was not directly addressed in this proceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned testing for protein. The five orders included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing currently base protein testing on the standard Kjeldahl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method, which tests for nitrogen and then converts the nitrogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result to protein. Since there is a certain amount of free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrogen in milk this test somewhat overstates the protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of milk. Recent developments in testing allow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for true protein which is a more accurate reflection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein content. In no way does this decision mandate a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing procedure. However, when (or if) the industry does move 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to testing for true protein, this decision should not be viewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a hindrance to that conversion. At the time a change to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for true protein may occur, a change in the 1.32 factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Somatic Cell Adjustment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The producer price differential paid to each producer should be adjusted on the basis of the somatic cell content of
the producer's milk no matter how the milk is used by a handler. The value adjustment per hundredweight for each 1,000
somatic cells would be determined by multiplying .0005 times the monthly average National Cheese Exchange 40-pound
block cheese price. Each producer's monthly average somatic cell count (SCC), in thousands, would be subtracted
from 350 and multiplied by the value adjustment per 1,000 SCCs. Somatic cell adjustments will not be included in the
computation of the producer price differential.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A wide range of somatic cell or quality plans were included in the notice of hearing and at the hearing itself. In general,
all parties agreed that high-quality milk is important to all segments of the dairy industry. The major differences
between the parties arose over the questions of how and whether quality and/or somatic cell adjustments should be
included in the Federal order program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness expert in the field of milk testing and quality testified about the influence somatic cells have on milk and
the resulting affect on products made from milk. The witness explained that in normal healthy cows the somatic cell
count is around 50,000. When an infection occurs in the udder of the cow white blood cells enter to fight the bacterial
infection. The SCC thus increases with the increasing number of white blood cells. In fact, white blood cells and somatic
cells are synonymous in this context. The witness continued by explaining that white blood cells contain enzymes
that are designed to break down the cell walls of the bacteria that are infecting the udder, but do not distinguish between
milk protein and bacteria. As a result, milk protein is also degraded. The witness also stated that the enzyme causes
some deterioration in milkfat. The witness continued by explaining that these white blood cells also cause to be activated
a proteolytic enzyme that is present in all milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expert witness went on to explain that casein, which is the functionally important protein in milk, is broken down
into smaller protein chains that cannot perform the same functions as the casein. In fact, the witness explained,
the destruction of the casein affects all dairy products that rely on casein for structure or function. These products
include cheeses, whipped cream, yogurt, ice cream, and condensed and dry products used in the manufacture of other
products in which casein is a functional necessity. The witness also explained that higher SCC milks have a tendency
to have a faster increase in ``acid degree value'', which is a measure of rancidity and off flavors, than milks with
low SCCs. The witness testified that most of the damage occurs in the udder of the cow, where conditions are ideal for
the various enzymes to work. Once the milk is removed from the udder and cooled and stored properly, further deterioration
does not stop but is slowed down significantly, and further damage is minimized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expert witness discussed the effect that somatic cell counts have on the manufacture of various dairy products,
specifically cheese. He explained that high SCC milk results in lower cheese yields as well as problems with moisture
control and the activity of the starter culture. The increased somatic cells result in less casein in relationship
to the total protein so that less cheese is produced than would be indicated by the amount of protein present. The degraded
protein ends up in the whey with the rest of the whey proteins. The witness explained that in studies using individual
cow's milk cheese yield would drop dramatically as the somatic cell count went above 100,000, with the yield staying
fairly constant as the somatic cell count climbed to 1,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness pointed out that the cheese yield effect of somatic cells differs when bulk tank milk is used instead of
an individual cow's milk. He explained that in the case of bulk tank milk the relationship between cheese yield and
somatic cell counts would be linear, with cheese yields declining as SCCs increase. The witness stated that the linear
relationship is caused by the weighting of the SCCs in the bulk tank. Bulk tank tests are weighted averages rather than
simple averages. For example, if 100 pounds of milk with a somatic cell count of 50,000 and 400 pounds of milk with a somatic
cell count of 250,000 are added to the bulk tank the somatic cell count would be a weighted average of 210,000 and not
the simple average of 150,000.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The witness also testified that the effect of somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels on fluid milk products is reflected in higher acid degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values that indicate rancidity and off flavors, resulting in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shorter shelf life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expert witness testified that routine testing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cells is conducted using a Foss-O-Matic infrared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzer. The reference method for testing is the direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microscope somatic cell count in which the sample is stained and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the somatic cells are counted using a microscope. The witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that if the electronic instruments are calibrated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same reference samples the resulting test values and standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviations should be in close agreement. The witness concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that on a relative basis the results should be close to what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be obtained using other analytical tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice of hearing contained a proposal by CMPC to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include an adjustment for somatic cells. However at the hearing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a witness for CMPC explained that CMPC had decided neither to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support nor oppose the inclusion of a somatic cell adjuster in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amended orders. The CMPC witness testified that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual members of CMPC were free to support or oppose any of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the somatic cell proposals as they saw fit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As originally proposed by CMPC, the somatic cell adjustment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be computed by multiplying the National Cheese Exchange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrel price times .0005. The resulting quantity would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplied by 500 minus the somatic cell count of the milk, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousands. The resulting value would be applied on a per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight basis. As explained by a witness for CMPC, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed somatic cell adjuster would apply to all producer milk, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including that purchased by Class I handlers. The witness went 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on to explain that the effect of somatic cells on the value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer milk and milk used in Class II and Class III would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the computation of the producer price differential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A somatic cell adjustment on Class I milk would not be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the pool, and therefore would not affect Class I handlers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for WCMA quoted extensively from the MCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended decisions for the Indiana, Ohio Valley, and Eastern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ohio-Western Pennsylvania milk marketing orders, and for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Michigan milk order, supporting the inclusion of an adjustment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for somatic cells in Federal orders. The witness supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CMPC proposal, but suggested that the somatic cell adjustment be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to all milk; that is, Class I milk would not be exempted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a somatic cell adjustment. In addition, he proposed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the somatic cell adjustment be applied to the protein price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than on a hundredweight basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for TAPP and FUMMC expressed support for including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a somatic cell adjustment in the amended orders. The TAPP&hyph;FUMMC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brief also supported such a provision. The witness stated that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjustment would benefit producers, handlers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers by increasing the volume of milk marketed, improving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield, and supplying consumers with more nutritious, better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality dairy products. The TAPP/FUMMC witness explained that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their proposal would have a neutral range of 301,000 to 400,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cells with a one-cent positive adjustment for each 50,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell count below the neutral range up to a maximum of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six cents as the somatic cell count declined, and a one cent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative adjustment for each 50,000 somatic cell count above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutral range up to a maximum of ten cents as the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count increased. The TAPP/FUMMC witness testified that under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their proposal the somatic cell adjustment would apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer milk, milk used in Class III, and, if the plan is to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revenue neutral, also to milk used in Class II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for Swiss Valley Farms Company (Swiss Valley) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testified in support of including additions and subtractions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cells in the amended order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Swiss Valley witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that somatic cells add proteolytic and lipolytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enzymes to the milk, as well as a plasmin enzyme that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely heat stable, such that it is not deactivated during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization. Therefore, the enzyme continues to degrade the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk during storage. The witness added that low SCC milk is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to the Swiss Valley bottling operations because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in fluid milk products of improved flavor, and to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese-making operations because of the resulting higher casein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and lower whey protein content of the milk, which increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing returns.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Swiss Valley witness proposed that the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment begin at 400,000, with a positive adjustment as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCC declines, and a negative adjustment as the SCC increases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that level. The adjustment would be five percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Cheese Exchange block price per 100,000 somatic cells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Swiss Valley witness explained that the adjustment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cells should apply to all producer milk and that Swiss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley would support a somatic cell adjustment on Class II and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III milk for the handler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its post-hearing brief, Swiss Valley reiterated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony of its witness in favor of including an adjustment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cells in the amended order. Besides supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position of the Swiss Valley witness, Swiss Valley expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general support for a somatic cell adjustment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testimony by a fluid processor witness indicated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler pays a quality premium when buying milk from producers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and specifies minimum quality standards on purchased tanker milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-Am), testified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Mid-Am favored the inclusion of an adjustment for somatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells in the amended order. The witness quoted from the Final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision of the Indiana, Ohio Valley, and Eastern Ohio-Western 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pennsylvania proceeding to support the position of Mid-Am that an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment for somatic cells should be included based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect somatic cells have on all milk. The witness explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that quantifying the adjustment on an incremental basis was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult, and since not all milk is used in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese a moderate adjustment rate should be used. The witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that the Mid-Am proposal would apply the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment to all producer milk, on a hundredweight basis, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive adjustment for a somatic cell count below 400,000 and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative adjustment for SCCs above 400,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The witness explained that under the Mid-Am proposal, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjustment would be computed by subtracting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly average somatic cell count (in thousands) of the producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from 400 and then multiplying the result by the National Cheese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exchange monthly average barrel cheese price multiplied by .0005. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
He stated that since the somatic cell adjustment would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the computation of the producer price differential, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the producer side only, the total size of the pool would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change but individual producers would receive more or less, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on whether their milk had a somatic cell count above or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the average SCC of the market. The Mid-Am witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued by explaining that the Mid-Am proposal would be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redistribution of money from high somatic cell testing producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk to the lower somatic cell testing milk, since there would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no additional money in the pool from the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instead of supporting the inclusion of somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment provisions in the five Federal orders, witnesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testifying on behalf of Land of Lakes, Inc., and NCI supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those organizations' proposals to allow each handler to submit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell or quality adjustment plan for payments to its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers to the market administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for LOL testified that with the LOL proposal a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler could reduce a producer's payment by up to ten percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that required by the order if other producers of the handler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received positive adjustments to their payments, as long as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total payments were equal to at least the minimum total order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment requirements. The witness explained that LOL's proposal does not contain specific criteria for quality
and/or volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments. Each handler would submit an individual quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or volume adjustment plan to the market administrator which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the handler would be required to adhere to until a new plan would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be submitted. The witness testified that there is general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement among handlers for the need to adjust payments for milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on quality and volume. The witness continued by arguing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that since the industry has not yet reached a consensus on how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjust for quality and volume, it would be appropriate to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each handler to develop its own quality and volume plan with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of the market administrator.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A witness for NCI testified that even though somatic cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the quality of milk, particularly in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cheese, it is difficult to place a value on their effect. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness explained that the variability in somatic cell levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from day to day and producer to producer makes determining an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate payment adjustment imprecise. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness pointed out that other factors affect milk quality, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that placing a precise value on their effect is even more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult than in the case of somatic cells. The NCI witness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that the NCI proposal would allow each handler to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish and apply its own somatic cell adjustment schedule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the approval of the market administrator, as long as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total payments to producers met or exceeded the Federal order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum value. The witness explained that each handler could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change its payment plan as conditions warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A witness for Kraft emphasized the earlier testimony on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of somatic cells on milk quality and cheese yields. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness listed several studies supporting the results testified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to by the NAJ expert witness. The Kraft witness testified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kraft has, since the early 1980's, employed a quality payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program as part of its producer payroll. The witness went on to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that the plethora of somatic cell payment programs in use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the industry is strong evidence of the industry's recognition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that somatic cells play a major role in milk quality. The Kraft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
witness explained that, in order of preference, Kraft supports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposal submitted by NCI, followed by LOL's proposal and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TAPP/FUMMC proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kraft, in its post-hearing brief, reiterated its support for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a somatic cell adjustment to be included in the amended order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kraft's brief did not support a particular adjustment plan but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preferred the LOL&hyph;NCI concept. If that plan were not adopted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kraft expressed support for the proposal by Mid-Am or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original CMPC proposal. A brief filed largely reiterative of NCI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony was filed on behalf of NCI with the Dairy Division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than the Hearing Clerk, and was received more than 3 weeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the extended due date for filing briefs. The brief is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Anderson-Erickson Dairy Company (A&hyph;E) post-hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brief, A-E opposed the application of an adjustment for somatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells to Class I milk. They contended that the Class I handler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is unable to recover the added cost of lower somatic cell count 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk from the retail market. This position was supported in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-hearing brief filed by Lamers Dairy and Hansen Dairy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Lamers). Lamers pointed to testimony that indicated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monetary effect of somatic cells on Class I milk could not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantified as it could be with the manufacture of cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NFO, in its post-hearing brief, opposed the inclusion of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjuster in the recommended order. NFO expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the opinion that support for a somatic cell adjuster was rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weak, with none of the positions presented having strong support. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, the NFO brief pointed to the neutral position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken by CMPC at the hearing after including a somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjuster in the original CMPC proposal. The NFO brief continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by explaining that testimony at the hearing indicated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between somatic cell levels and economic return is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a clear and definite relationship. The NFO brief went on to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point out that there was no consensus at the hearing on how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply a somatic cell adjuster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is ample testimony and evidence to support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion of a somatic cell adjuster in these amended orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The somatic cell adjuster per hundredweight per 1,000 somatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells will be calculated by multiplying .0005 times the monthly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block cheese price. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the value for an individual producer, the producer
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly average somatic cell count (in thousands) will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subtracted from 350 and multiplied by the somatic cell adjuster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the somatic cell adjustment will be applied on a per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight basis in the handlers' payment to producers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Somatic cells will not be included in the computation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer price differential.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application of the somatic cell adjustment contained herein will promote orderly marketing. As pointed out by
several witnesses testifying at the hearing, producers in these markets are faced with a wide array of quality premium
programs. These programs have no standard basis or standard value that is applied between handlers. Therefore a producer
is faced with trying to decide which premium program will give the producer the greatest return without a standard
with which to compare. Inconsistent premium programs also result in producers with identical milk receiving different
prices for that milk depending on which handler is procuring the milk. The inclusion of this recommended somatic cell
adjustment will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act by encouraging orderly marketing through the standardization
of the basis for payment on the level of somatic cells in the milk and the standardization and checking of the testing
and test procedures used for determining the somatic cell counts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was stated earlier, all parties agreed that high quality milk is important to all segments of the dairy industry.
In fact, there was little opposition to the inclusion of an adjustment for quality in the amended orders. Even though
testimony indicated that there are other quality factors that are important in overall milk quality, there was no
determination of their effect on milk quality or any attempt to compute a relevant associated value. Therefore, somatic
cell count will be used as the quality adjustment factor in this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two basic reasons to apply the somatic cell adjustment rate on a hundredweight basis rather than to adjust
the protein price. First, the somatic cell adjustment reflects the quality of milk in all uses rather than just cheese,
and second, application of the somatic cell adjustment on a hundredweight basis makes it very clear to producers and
to handlers that quality affects milk used in all products. Although testimony clearly showed that somatic cells
affect the quality of milk in all uses, a value determined on the basis of the effect of somatic cells on cheese reflects
the most prevalent use of milk in these markets and is the easiest way to determine a value for payment to producers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A lack of agreement among hearing participants occurred in trying to determine the application of a somatic cell adjustment.
There was a general consensus that an adjustment should be made in the producer pay price for quality and/or somatic
cells. The rate at which such adjustment should be made varied by proposal, but was tied to the reduction in cheese yield
that occurs as somatic cell counts increase. Several witnesses testified that the somatic cell adjustment rate should
be set at a moderate level. Testimony indicated that most of the decline in cheese yield occurs as the SCC increases
from below 100,000 to above 100,000, with a much slower decline in yield as the somatic cell count increases to one million.
However, testimony also showed that declines in yield are much more linear when somatic cell tests and cheese yield
studies are done with bulk tank milk than with the milk of individual cows. Several proposals suggested using a factor
of .0005 times the cheese price in determining the value of the somatic cell adjustment per 1,000 somatic cells. This
factor is derived from the approximately four percent decline in cheese yield as the somatic cell count increases
from 100,000 to one million. This is the same adjustment that is used in other Federal orders in which a somatic cell
adjuster is included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula used to determine the somatic cell adjuster reflects the changes in the yield of cheese as the levels of
somatic cells change. The formula also ties the adjustment to the value of the milk by using the block cheese price to
determine the value per 1,000 somatic cells. However, since record evidence clearly shows that the affect of somatic
cells on Class I and Class II products is related more to the quality of the finished product than to the yield of the product,
the formula should reflect less than the full value of the affect of somatic cells on cheese yield. Using the recommended
formula, the somatic cell adjustment for the average producer under the Chicago Regional order would be three cents
per hundredweight, far below the 25 cents per hundredweight average quality premium that is shown in hearing exhibits
as being paid currently.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The corresponding somatic cell adjustments for average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers under the four orders in addition to Chicago are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upper Midwest, zero cents; Iowa, minus one cent; Nebraska-Western 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iowa, minus six cents; and Eastern South Dakota, minus three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents. The formula results in an estimated range of forty-eight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cents per hundredweight from a somatic cell count of 1,000 to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell count of 750,000, or a positive twenty-two cents to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a minus twenty-six cents, although there is no limit on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction that may be made since there is no limit on the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCC in this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of a neutral point was supported by various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proponents of a somatic cell adjuster. Several others suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a neutral range. The record contains numerous references to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutral range or point around a somatic cell count of 400,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One witness expressed the opinion that the base level for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjustment should be near the average for the five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markets. Another witness explained that their proposal used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
400,000 SCC because that is where their present quality program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins. Based on data included in the hearing record, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average SCC for producers whose milk is pooled under the five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders is 367,000. Therefore, a neutral point of 350,000 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. It is close to the average for the markets, and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially different from the values that witnesses found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Also, by using the formula included herein, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proponents of both a neutral point or a neutral range are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodated because the formula yields no value adjustment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately plus or minus 7,000 SCC around 350,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The formula will give producers an incentive to reduce their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCCs while minimizing the effect of the somatic cell adjuster on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those products in which somatic cells have a quality effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than a yield effect. The argument that a somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjuster will negate the forward pricing of Class I and Class II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milk is also minimized by the proposed formula. Analysis shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the month-to-month variation in the somatic cell adjustment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at a particular somatic cell level is no more than one cent per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight, with an approximate change of 1 cent for every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increment of 15,000 somatic cells. This small variation from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month to month should allow handlers to determine accurately the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of milk for forward pricing. In fact, the variation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjustment is significantly less than the month-to-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
month variation in the current butterfat differential, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not known until after the end of the month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this decision applies an adjustment for somatic cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all milk, there is no need to include the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment in the computation of the producer price differential. There are only two reasons to include somatic cells
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer price differential computation: (1) To exclude a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular class or classes of milk from being affected by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjustment, or (2) to redistribute the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment money among all of the producers in the market. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this decision applies the somatic cell adjustment to all milk the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first reason is not relevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be some merit for redistributing money from high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell producers to low somatic cell producers marketwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if such a provision were adopted, the producer price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential would also be affected with changes in the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average SCC. In fact, as the market average SCC decreased, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer price differential would decline below the level of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer price differential in the absence of a somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count adjustment, decreasing the incentive for producers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the somatic cell counts of their milk and defeating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of a somatic cell count adjustment. Therefore the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatic cell adjustment will be applied to all producer milk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without being included in the pool or producer price differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation.

Neither the quality proposal by LOL nor the somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal by NCI, in which each handler would be allowed to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual quality or somatic cell payment plan to the market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrator, is included in this decision. Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act in 7 U.S.C. 608c(5) does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for adjustments to minimum pay prices on the basis of

quality, such adjustments should be at a uniform rate for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers in the market. Allowing each handler to have its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment schedule would defeat the concept of uniform pricing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers, eliminate the purpose of allowing quality adjustments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the order, and lead to disorderly marketing. Producers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with identical milk shipping to different handlers within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same market could, and probably would, have different minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order pay prices if each handler had its own quality or somatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cell payment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of witnesses testified that the profusion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment plans currently in effect in the market today are causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disorderly marketing, and that one of the benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating multiple component pricing with a somatic cell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustment in the five orders would be to reduce or at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardize the vast array of producer payment plans currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect in the region. In view of such testimony, adoption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOL or NCI quality adjustment proposals would serve no purpose.

5. Conforming Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To accommodate multiple component pricing a number of changes need to be made in the current order provisions of the
five orders in this decision. To compute a handler's obligation and the producer price differential, several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices need to be defined. The Class I differential price should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be defined as the difference between the current month's Class I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price and the current month's Class III price. The Class II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential price should be defined as the difference between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current month's Class II price and the current month's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class III price. These differential prices should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confused with the fixed value that is added to the Minnesota-Wisconsin price for the second preceding month to arrive
at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class I price for the current month, or the computed value that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used in the computation of the Class II price. It should also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be pointed out that these differential prices may be negative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which currently happens when the Minnesota-Wisconsin price is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than the Class I or Class II price. The skim milk price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be calculated by subtracting from the Class III price the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value determined by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The skim milk price will be expressed on a per hundredweight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis with four places to the right of the decimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since producer location adjustments are not changed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, the application of such adjustments to the producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price differential remains unchanged. In some of the orders the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform price is ``snubbed'' at the Class III price when producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location adjustments are applied. In these orders, the producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
price differential will be adjusted for location until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer price differential is zero if the producer price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential at the zero zone is zero or greater. However, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the producer price differential is negative, no minus producer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location adjustment will be applied. Plus adjustments to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative producer price differential would be made. In those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders in which the uniform price is not ``snubbed'' to the Class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III price, producer location adjustments will be applied as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are currently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Market Administrator to compute the producer price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential handlers will need to supply additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on their monthly reports of receipts and utilization. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the product pounds and butterfat currently reported, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handlers will be required to report pounds of protein and pounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of other solids. This information will be required from each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler for all producer receipts, including milk diverted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler, receipts from cooperatives as 9(c) handlers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipts of bulk milk received by transfer or diversion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Upper Midwest Order only, the due date for handlers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit reports of receipts and utilization should be changed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the 10th of the month to the 8th of the month. Currently, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Upper Midwest Order requires handlers to submit reports by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 10th of the month, and the Uniform Price to be announced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 11th of the month, allowing only one day for the pooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. The other four orders involved in this decision allow a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer period of time for the processing of data and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announcement of the Uniform Price. In the Chicago Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order, handler reports are due on the 10th, and the Uniform Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is announced on the 14th, a period of 4 days. In the Iowa Order, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler reports are due on the 8th, and the Uniform Price is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announced on the 12th, a period of 4 days. In the Nebraska-Western Iowa Order, handler reports are due on the 7th, and
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniform Price is announced on the 12th, a period of 5 days. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Eastern South Dakota Order, handler reports are due on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8th, and the Uniform Price is announced on the 12th, a period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 days.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The order changes recommended in this decision will require the market administrator of each order to carry out a more
comprehensive review and analysis of the data than is required currently. As noted at the hearing, the pooling process
will become somewhat more complicated because data submitted will involve not only skim and butterfat pounds, but
also pounds of protein and other solids. Thus, it is appropriate to allow the market administrator for the Upper Midwest
Order a period of 3 days to compute and announce the producer price differential and the statistical uniform price.
By changing the due date for handler reports from the 10th to the 8th, but retaining the 11th as the day the producer price
differential and statistical uniform price are to be announced, the pooling process will be better accommodated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of allocation of producer receipts the assumption will be made that the protein and other solids cannot
easily be separated from skim milk. The protein and other solids will therefore be allocated proportionately with
the skim milk based on the percentage of protein and other solids in the skim milk received from producers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of this multiple component pricing decision will require several changes in the way handlers
pay for milk. Partial payment at the Class III price for the previous month for milk deliveries during the first 15 days
of a month was proposed by both NAJ and CMPC. Although no objections to the proposal were expressed, there was no testimony
supporting or opposing the proposal. Therefore, there is no basis in the record of the proceeding to make substantive
changes in the payment provisions of the orders that provide for partial payments at a significantly different level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the Nebraska-Western Iowa order, the Upper Midwest order, and the Iowa order require partial payments
to be based on the prior month's uniform price. Since this component pricing plan does not contain a uniform price,
these three orders will be changed to require the partial payments to be made at the ``statistical uniform price'',
announced by the market administrator on or before the 14th day of the month for which partial payment is to be made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chicago Regional order will also be changed from the current requirement that the partial payment be based on the
lowest class price for the prior month to a partial payment based on the prior month's Class III price. The Eastern South
Dakota order does not need to be changed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final payment to producers will be determined by the total hundredweight of milk times the producer price differential
adjusted by the applicable location adjustment, plus or minus the total hundredweight of milk times the adjustment
for somatic cells, plus the pounds of protein times the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids times the other
solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat times the butterfat price, minus any authorized deductions currently
allowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Handlers purchasing milk from cooperative pool plants will pay for Class I milk at the Class I differential price plus
the pounds of skim milk in Class I at the skim milk price plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price; for Class
II milk at the Class II differential price plus the pounds of protein at the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids
at the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat at the butterfat price; and for Class III milk at the protein
pounds times the protein price, plus the pounds of other solids at the other solids price, plus the pounds of butterfat
at the butterfat price. All milk purchased will be adjusted by the appropriate somatic cell adjustment. Payment for
9(c) milk will be based on the producer price differential adjusted for location at the plant of receipt and somatic
cells, plus the value of protein, other solids, and butterfat contained in the milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since producers will be receiving payments based on the component levels of their milk, the payroll reports that handlers
supply to producers must reflect the basis for such payment. Therefore the handler will be required to supply the producer
not only with the information currently supplied, but also: (a) The pounds of butterfat, the pounds of protein, and
the pounds of other solids contained in the producer's milk, as well as the producer's average somatic cell count,
and (b) the minimum rate that is required for payment for each component and, if a different rate is paid, the effective
rate also.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The handler's value of milk will be determined by combining: (a) The pounds of producer milk in Class I times the Class
I differential price, (b) the pounds of producer milk in Class II times the Class II differential price, (c) the value
of overage, (d) the value of inventory reclassification, (e) the value, at the Class I minus Class III price difference,
of other source receipts and receipts from unregulated supply plants allocated to Class I, (g) the value of handler
location adjustments, (h) Class III&hyph;A credits, (i) the pounds of skim milk in Class I times the skim milk price,
(j) the pounds of protein in Class II and Class III times the protein price, and (k) the pounds of other solids in Class
II and Class III times the other solids price.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pounds of protein and other solids in Class II and Class III will be determined by multiplying the percent protein
or percent other solids in the skim milk of the total producer milk received by the handler times the pounds of skim milk
allocated to Class II and Class III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Handler's obligations to the producer settlement fund will be determined by subtracting from the handler's value
of milk the following: (a) The total pounds of each handler's producer milk times the producer price differential
adjusted for location, (b) the total pounds of protein contained in the producer milk times the protein price, (c)
the total pounds of other solids contained in the producer milk times the other solids price, and (d) the value of other
source milk at the producer price differential with any applicable location adjustment at the plant from which the
milk was shipped deducted from the handler's value of milk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to order language accompanying this recommended decision are based on the current language of the
five orders. There are two national amendatory proceedings in process (the M-W replacement and Class II pricing)
that may result in changes to some of the provisions that will also be changed by this proceeding. No attempt has been
made in drafting the order language amendments accompanying this decision to accommodate any of the changes that
may result from the other two proceedings. Any adjustments needed will be made on the basis of the order language in
effect at the time a final decision is issued.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Calculate the following values: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Multiply the total hundredweight of producer milk in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class I as determined pursuant to &sect;1030.44(c) by the Class I

differential price for the month; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight of producer milk in Class II as determined pursuant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each month the market administrator shall compute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the computation is less than 2 cents per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the report of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler who has not made the payments required pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1030.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the producer price differential. The report of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such handler shall not be included in the computation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the market administrator shall compute the producer price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differential in the following manner:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (b) through (k) for all handlers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Add values computed pursuant to &sect;1030.60 (a)(3), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the Class III price and the Class III&hyph;A price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times the pounds of product determined pursuant to &sect;1030.43(e);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handler who has not made the payments required pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1079.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computation of the producer price differential. The report of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Add values computed pursuant to &sect;1079.60 (a)(3), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the Class III price and the Class III-A price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times the pounds of product determined pursuant to &sect;1079.43(e);

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 directs EPA and HUD to jointly issue
regulations requiring disclosure of certain information by persons selling or leasing (leasing includes renting)
housing that may contain lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. Under that authority, EPA and HUD propose
the following requirements. Sellers and lessors, or any agent acting on their behalf, of most residential housing
built before 1978 would be required to provide purchasers and lessees with all information known to the seller, lessor,
or agent on the presence of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards, as well as an EPA pamphlet on lead-based
paint hazards. In addition, sellers would be required to grant purchasers 10 calendar days to conduct an inspection
or risk assessment for lead-based paint hazards before being obligated under any contract to purchase that housing.
Finally, the regulation would require that a standard warning, disclosure, and acknowledgement form be attached
to all leases and sales contracts involving target housing. The rule would require the completion of these disclosure
activities before the purchaser or lessee had become obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the target
housing.

I. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is issued under the authority of section 1018 of the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction
Act of 1992, [42 U.S.C. 4852(d)]. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act is Title X of the Housing and
Community and Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550.

A. Legal Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, Congress, recognizing the need to control exposure to lead-based paint hazards, passed the Residential
Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (the Act). The main purpose of the Act was to develop the infrastructure
and standards necessary to reduce lead-based paint hazards in housing (section 1003 of the Act). Congress recognized
that lead poisoning is a particular threat to children under age 6, and particularly emphasized the needs of this vulnerable
population within various sections of the Act. Section 1021 of the Act amends the Toxic Substances Control Act (``TSCA''),
15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq., by adding a new Title IV entitled ``Lead Exposure Reduction.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions under some sections of the Act are to be implemented and administered by HUD, some by EPA, and some jointly by
both agencies, often in consultation with other federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule is issued under the authority of section 1018 of the Act. Section 1018 requires EPA and HUD to jointly
promulgate regulations for disclosure of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in target housing which is
offered for sale or lease. Target housing is defined in section 1004(27) of the Act and in Unit V. of this preamble. Specifically,
section 1018 requires: (1) Sellers or lessors to provide the purchaser or lessee of target housing with a lead information
pamphlet to be developed under section 406(a) of TSCA; (2) sellers and lessors of target housing to disclose any known
lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazard in such housing; (3) sellers of target housing to permit purchasers a
10-day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint hazards; and (4)
attachment of a lead warning statement to each contract for purchase and sale of target housing. Violation of section
1018 may result in civil and criminal penalties and potential triple damages in a private civil suit. Section 1018
provides that regulations under this section must be promulgated no later than 2 years after the date of enactment
of the Act and must take effect 3 years after enactment of the Act. Thus, Congress intended that the section 1018 regulations
must be published as final by October 28, 1994, and must take effect on October 28, 1995. Although 1018 specified that
final regulations should be promulgated no later than October 28, 1994, EPA/HUD will not be able to meet this deadline.
It appears that Congress' intent in section 1018 was to provide a year between the promulgation of the final rule, and
the effective date of the rule. Congress reasonably could have believed that this year was necessary in order that
the real estate industry, landlords, sellers, etc. could become familiar with the rule requirements and set up procedures
for compliance. For this reason, EPA and HUD believe that the effective date of the rule should be no earlier than 1 year
after promulgation of the final rule, even if this occurs later than October 28, 1995. EPA and HUD believe that this
interpretation is the one most consistent with Congressional intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several related provisions of the Act and of the new Title IV of TSCA, added by section 1021 of the Act, are briefly discussed
below to further clarify this proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section most closely related to section 1018 is section 406 of TSCA. Section 406(a) directs EPA to develop and publish,
after notice and comment, a lead hazard information pamphlet on lead and lead-based paint hazards in the home. EPA
has developed the draft pamphlet in consultation with HUD and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
and published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11119), announcing the pamphlet's availability for public review and comment. As required
under section 1018 of the Act, the section 406 pamphlet will be given to purchasers and lessees under the EPA/HUD disclosure
regulations proposed today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 1004(15), 1004(16), and 1004(17) of the Act generally define lead-based paint hazards, lead-contaminated
dust, and lead-contaminated soil. Congress charged EPA under section 403 of TSCA to issue regulations identifying
more specifically the meaning of these three terms, for the purposes of other provisions of TSCA and the Act. Thus,
EPA is in the process of defining more precisely what constitutes a lead-based paint hazard, including lead-contaminated
dust and lead-contaminated soil. However, EPA and HUD believe that the provisions of this proposed section 1018 rule
can be carefully considered on their own merit and independent of decisions made under the section 403 rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA and HUD are soliciting public comment on this proposed rule prior to the availability of proposed or
final regulations under section 403. EPA and HUD believe the public has adequate information and opportunity to comment
on the contents of this proposed rule and on the relationship between regulations promulgated under sections 1018
and 403 for the following reasons: (1) While known lead-based paint hazards must be disclosed, this requirement is
only one of a number of requirements for which sellers and lessors of target housing are responsible. Therefore, EPA's
definition of ``lead-based paint hazards'' does not change the affected population, although that definition has
clear implications for the extent of disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The requirements under section 1018 will apply to all target housing regardless of the presence of lead-based
paint hazards in that housing. That is, all owners, sellers, and lessors of target housing will be on notice that EPA
and HUD are issuing disclosure requirements, and that they will be required to retain and disclose certain types of
information and to allow for the 10&hyph;day inspection period, regardless of whether their housing contains lead-based
paint or a lead-based paint hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Act clearly specifies the requirements of this proposed rule. Therefore, regardless of the standards proposed
and issued in the section 403 regulations, EPA and HUD do not have flexibility to change the basic provisions specified
by Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 403, on the other hand, does give EPA flexibility to consider a number of factors in developing health-based
standards. Comments specifically concerning the implications of EPA's section 403 standards, given the concrete
legislative requirements of section 1018, will be most appropriately addressed by EPA during the development of
the section 403 rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 402 of TSCA requires that EPA (in consultation with HUD, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health
and Human Services) promulgate regulations to ensure that individuals engaged in certain lead-based paint activities
are trained, that such training programs are accredited, and that contractors engaging in such activities are certified.
This section also requires that EPA, in consultation with the above agencies, shall develop standards for performance
of lead-based paint activities. Pursuant to section 402, EPA is in the process of developing regulations which would
require that detailed reports be written at the completion of any lead inspection or risk assessment, whether voluntary
or required. Such reports would have to be disclosed as information known to the seller or lessor under the proposed
section 1018 disclosure requirements being proposed today.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead and lead-based paint
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Lead is a soft, bluish metallic element mined from rock and found in its natural state all over the world. Lead is virtually
indestructible, is nonbiodegradable, and has been known since antiquity for its adaptability in making various
useful items. In modern times it has been used to manufacture many different products, including paint, batteries,
pipes, solder, pottery, and gasoline. From the turn of the century through the 1940's, paint manufacturers frequently
used lead as a primary ingredient in many oil-based interior and exterior house paints. Usage gradually decreased
through the 1950's and 60's as latex paints (which are generally lead-free) became more widespread. Although the
Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) banned lead-based paints from residential use in 1978 (paint currently
may not have greater than .06 percent lead by weight) (Ref. 1), HUD estimates that 75 percent of the houses built in the
United States before 1978 contain some lead-based paint (Ref. 2). By current estimations, approximately 57 million
homes may contain lead-based paint (Ref. 2). Thus lead-based paint may pose a potential hazard to the occupants under
some conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead hazards
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Lead affects virtually every system of the body. While it is harmful to individuals of all ages, lead exposure is especially
harmful to children, fetuses, and women of childbearing age. Results of recent studies suggest that lead's adverse
effects occur at blood-lead levels previously thought to be safe; in fact, there does not yet appear to be a discernable
threshold for the adverse effects of lead on the young (Ref. 3). Lead poisoning has been referred to as ``the silent
disease'' because its effects often occur gradually and imperceptibly, showing no obvious symptoms. Over time,
low levels of lead in the bloodstream can cause learning disabilities, interfere with growth, cause permanent hearing
and visual impairment, and cause other damage to the brain and nervous system. In large doses, lead can cause blindness,
brain damage, convulsions, and even death. Lead exposure before or during pregnancy can also affect fetal development
and cause miscarriages (Ref. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services characterized lead poisoning as the ``number
one environmental threat to the health of children in the United States'' (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the percentage of children with elevated blood-lead levels has declined over the last 20 years with the reduction
of lead in gasoline, millions of U.S. children still have levels of lead in their blood high enough to seriously threaten
their health (Ref. 5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lead-based paint poses a health threat through various routes of exposure. Children under age 6 may ingest lead-based
paint chips from flaking walls, windows, and doors. Lead from exterior house paint can flake off or leach into the soil
around the outside of a home, contaminating children's playing areas. Dust caused during normal lead-based paint
wear (especially around windows and doors) can create an invisible film over surfaces in a house. In some cases, cleaning
and renovation activities can actually increase the threat of lead-based paint exposure by dispersing fine lead
dust particles in the air and over accessible household surfaces. Both adults and children can receive hazardous
exposures by inhaling the fine dust or by ingesting paint-dust during hand-to-mouth activities.

III. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this proposed rule is to ensure that families are aware of: (1) The existence of lead-based paint or lead-based
paint hazards in target housing, (2) the hazards of exposure to lead-based paint, and (3) ways to avoid such exposure
before they become obligated to purchase or lease housing that may contain lead-based paint. EPA and HUD are proposing
identical rules to appear in both Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) where other EPA lead rules will appear
and in Title 24 of the CFR where other HUD lead rules appear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Scope and Applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018 of the Act applies to contracts for sale or lease of target housing as defined in section 1004(27) of the
Act. Therefore, this rulemaking would apply to virtually all transactions involving a written contract to sell or
lease target housing. EPA and HUD have identified the following several specific areas that would be excluded or where
coverage would be limited in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Foreclosure Sales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA and HUD have identified both legal and policy reasons to exclude the sale of properties at foreclosure from the
section 1018 requirements. First, when a property is sold at foreclosure, the sale is conducted at public auction
by or on behalf of a secured lender, and the property is sold to the highest bidder without any form of arms-length negotiation
and without a sales contract. In most of these cases, the lender is not in possession of the property being sold and never
has been; the property is controlled by the owner, who is often hostile to the lender and to any potential purchaser.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this reason, the lender (or the party conducting the sale for the lender) is often not in a position to provide a potential
purchaser with access to the property for a risk assessment or inspection, nor are they usually in possession of information
concerning the existence of lead-based paint, as required by section 1018(a)(1)(B). In fact, lenders typically
know very little about the history of single-family properties in their portfolios, and these make up the vast majority
of the properties being foreclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's experience in foreclosure sales suggests that most properties sold at foreclosure are not sold to private investors
or people attempting to purchase a residence for themselves. Rather, the secured lender, acting to protect its security
for the defaulted loan, is the successful bidder in nearly all foreclosure sales, purchasing the property at auction.
When the lender is the purchaser, the lender will typically attempt to recover its investment by selling the property
to a third party and, at that point, the protections of section 1018 would clearly apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Informal Rental Agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this proposed rulemaking only applies to transactions to lease housing which involve a written contract,
EPA and HUD have concluded that it should not apply to informal rental agreements which do not involve a lease. Such
arrangements, by virtue of their informality, make the administration and enforcement of these requirements extremely
difficult. To the extent practicable, however, EPA and HUD encourage individuals engaging in such informal arrangements
to obtain available information on lead-based paint before occupying target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Renewals of Existing Leases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA and HUD do not believe that individuals would significantly benefit from multiple receipt of previously disclosed
information during renewals of existing leases and see no justification for placing repetitive disclosure requirements
on lessors. For that reason, renewals of existing leases would only be covered by this proposed regulation if the tenant
has not previously received the lead-based paint hazard information required under section 1018. If, however, the
lessor becomes aware of additional information about the property concerning lead-based paint or lead-based paint
hazards during the term of the lease, he or she would be required to disclose this information prior to renewal of the
lease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to implement section 1018 of the Act, certain terms need to be defined. This section will provide the regulatory
definition followed by an explanation of the definition's source. Where possible, EPA and HUD have drawn definitions
directly from section 1004 of the Act. In cases where the statute either failed to define terms for the rulemaking or
where the definition lacked sufficient detail, EPA and HUD are proposing appropriate definitions, along with an
explanation of the reasons for their choices. EPA and HUD are accepting comment on all definitions not taken directly
from the statute. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abatement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any set of measures designed to permanently eliminate lead-based paint hazards in accordance with standards
established by appropriate Federal agencies. Such term includes: (1) The removal of lead-based paint and lead-contaminated
dust, the permanent containment or encapsulation of lead-based paint, the replacement of lead painted surfaces
or fixtures, and the removal or covering of lead-contaminated soil; and (2) all preparation, clean up, disposal,
and post abatement clearance testing activities associated with such measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 1004(1) of the Act. In accordance with the development of standards for the performance
of abatements by EPA under section 402 of TSCA, EPA may propose modifications to this definition in a separate proposed
rule. If such a revision is proposed, EPA and HUD would consider including the revised definition in the final rule
for these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, Title X of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-550. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any party who enters into a contract with a seller or lessor to represent the seller or lessor for the purpose of
selling or leasing target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is based on the statutory wording of section 1018(a)(4) of the Act, which states that ``Whenever a
seller or lessor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
has entered into a contract with an agent for the purpose of selling or leasing a residential dwelling of target housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the regulations promulgated under this section shall require the agent, on behalf of the seller or lessor, to ensure
compliance with the requirements of this section'' [emphasis added]. This provision clearly identifies an agent
as a party who has entered into a contract for the purpose of selling or leasing target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State statutory provisions and common law may vary on the topic of real estate contracts and the concept of agency.
In response to this diversity in state law, EPA and HUD propose a definition of ``agent'' which does not seek to differentiate
various real estate agent activities. The agencies believe that this proposed definition provides necessary flexibility
regarding which parties could be defined as ``agents'' who have entered into a contract to sell or lease target housing
and, as a consequence, would be covered by the requirements of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, it is EPA's and HUD's understanding that in many states, it is typical for a seller or lessor to enter into
a contract to sell or lease target housing with a licensed ``real estate broker,'' who may or may not perform the actual
duties of an ``agent'' associated with selling or leasing housing. In these states, individuals working for the licensed
broker, typically called ``real estate agents,'' may perform some or all of the duties of an ``agent'' but may be treated
as an employee of the broker or independent contractor. If the ``real estate agent'' were to fail to ensure compliance
with the requirements of the rulemaking, the broker would assume liability for that failure, just as if the broker
had performed all agent duties themselves. In other states, the real estate agent is considered an independent contractor
rather than an employee of the broker, and the agent, rather than the broker, is held liable for negligence under common
law. Because of these variations in state law, EPA/HUD propose a flexible definition of agent, one that could include
broker and/or agent, depending on the particular circumstance. If state law does not recognize the difference between
a real estate agent and a real estate broker, the party identified in the contract, and in any subcontract to perform
those duties, would be liable for any failure to comply, regardless of whether they were called brokers or agents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically excluded from the requirements of this regulation, however, would be agents or brokers who operate
solely on behalf of the buyer(s) or lessee(s) and who receive all remuneration from the buyer/lessee (so called ``buyers'
agents''). This exclusion is based on the language of section 1018(a)(4) which focuses on agents entering into a contract
with a seller or lessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Common Area
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a portion of a building generally accessible to all residents/users including, but not limited to, hallways,
stairways, laundry and recreational rooms, playgrounds, community centers, and boundary fences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD are proposing this definition to maintain consistency with the definition of ``common area'' proposed
in a separate notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11108), pursuant to the requirements of section 406 of TSCA. This definition is purposefully
broad to allow for its use in other EPA and HUD regulations that might also cover commercial and public buildings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Contract for the purchase and sale of residential real property
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any contract or agreement in which one party agrees to purchase an interest in real property on which there is
situated one or more residential dwellings used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, in whole or in part,
as the home or residence of one or more persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 1004(4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Evaluation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a risk assessment and/or inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 1004(6) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inspection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means (1) a surface-by-surface investigation to determine the presence of lead-based paint as provided in section
302(c) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning and Prevention Act [42 U.S.C. 4822], and (2) the provision of a report explaining
the results of the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 1004(12) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead-based paint
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means paint or other surface coatings that contain lead in excess of 1.0 milligrams per centimeter squared or 0.5 percent
by weight or (1) in the case of paint or other surface coatings on target housing, such lower level as may be established
by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as defined under section 302(c) of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning
Prevention Act [42 U.S.C. 4822], or (2) in the case of any other paint or surface coatings, such other level as may be
established by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 401 of TSCA. Title IV of TSCA was added by the Act, and, given the close relationship
between the section 1018 requirements and the provisions of TSCA Title IV, EPA and HUD believe it is consistent to use
the Title IV definition for section 1018 purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead-based paint hazard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any condition that causes exposure to lead from lead-contaminated dust, lead-contaminated soil, lead-contaminated
paint that is deteriorated or present in accessible surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces that would result
in adverse human health effects as established by the appropriate Federal Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 1004(15) of the Act. The exact levels of lead in dust, paint, and soil that would
be defined as a hazard will be addressed in a separate rulemaking, mandated by section 403 of TSCA. For the purposes
of this rulemaking, however, the statutory definition is sufficient to provide the public with notice to comment
on the rulemaking's requirements and structure. Parties who wish to provide comments specifically on what levels
of lead in dust and soil (or what conditions or locations of lead-based paint) should be considered a hazard, should
do so separately in the section 403 rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lessee
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any entity that enters into an agreement to lease or rent target housing, including but not limited to individuals,
partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations.

This proposed definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the intent of the Act in identifying individuals
entering into a contract to lease target housing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lessor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any entity that offers target housing for lease, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships, corporations,
trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. This definition is based on the
agencies' interpretation of the Act's intent in identifying entities entering into an agreement to lease target
housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Owner
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any entity that has legal title to target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships,
corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is based on the agencies' interpretation of the intent of the Act relating to owners of target housing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purchaser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any entity that submits a written offer to purchaser an interest in target housing, including but not limited
to individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit
organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD are proposing to limit the scope of this regulation to parties that demonstrate a real interest in purchasing
target housing, so that sellers or agents representing sellers need not provide all parties who view a property with
a 10 calendar-day opportunity to inspect for lead-based paint hazards. This definition is based on the agencies'
interpretation of the Act's intent in identifying purchasers of target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Residential dwelling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means (1) a single-family dwelling, including attached structures such as porches and stoops; or (2) a single-family
dwelling unit in a structure that contains more than one separate residential dwelling unit, and in which each such
unit is used or occupied, or intended to be used or occupied, in whole or in part, as the residence of one or more persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is provided in section 1004(23) of the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Risk assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an on-site investigation to determine and report the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based
paint hazards in residential dwellings, including: (1) Information gathering regarding the age and history of the
housing and occupancy by children under age 6; (2) visual inspection; (3) limited wipe sampling or other environmental
sampling techniques; (4) other activity as may be appropriate, and; (5) provision of a report explaining the results
of the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition is provided in section 1004(25) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Secretary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Seller
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any entity that sells an interest in target housing, including but not limited to individuals, partnerships,
corporations, trusteeships, government agencies, Indian tribes, or nonprofit organizations. The term seller
also includes: (1) An entity which transfers shares in a cooperatively-owned project and (2) an entity which transfers
its interest in a leasehold in jurisdictions or circumstances where it is legally permissible to separate the fee
title from the title to the improvement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD have proposed this definition to cover the range of entities and arrangements that may be involved in the
``sale'' of target housing and that the agencies interpret to be covered by the Act. The second part of the proposed
definition describes sellers who have legal title to the improvements (residential dwellings) on property that
is leased from another person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Target housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any housing constructed prior to 1978, except 0-bedroom dwellings, or housing for the elderly or persons with
disabilities (unless any child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in the dwelling). In the
case of jurisdictions which banned the sale or use of lead-based paint prior to 1978, the Secretary, at the Secretary's
discretion, may designate an earlier date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This definition appears in section 1004(27) of the Act. The Act excludes housing constructed after 1978 since the
allowable lead in paint was reduced to .06 percent by CPSC after that date (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD interpret the term ``0-bedroom dwelling'' to mean any dwelling in which the living area is unseparated
from the sleeping area. Under this definition, efficiency, studio apartments, loft space, and single-room dormitory
units would be exempt from the requirements of the rule unless children under 6 years of age reside or may reside in the
unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD interpret the term ``housing for the elderly,'' to mean retirement communities or similar types of housing
reserved for persons 62 years of age or older. EPA and HUD request comment on what additional specificity might be necessary
for identifying housing for the elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD also considered whether Congress meant to include hotels, motels, inns, and other commercial lodging
facilities in the term ``housing.'' Most hotels, motels, inns, and other commercial lodging are 0-bedroom dwellings,
and would typically be exempt from the requirements of this proposed rule. In addition, EPA and HUD believe it is reasonable
to interpret that Congress' intent was to distinguish residential housing from commercial lodging facilities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the definition of target housing intended to capture housing designed for long-term or continuous
residence, as opposed to lodging facilities offering temporary accommodations. Given the high frequency and short
duration of transactions, EPA and HUD believe it is impractical to apply the requirements of this proposed rule to
rental transactions in motels, hotels, and other commercial lodging facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As directed in the statute, the exclusions for 0-bedroom dwelling, elderly housing, and handicapped housing do not
apply to any housing in which children under 6 years old reside or are expected to reside. Similarly, in cases where
families with children under 6 might enter into a contract to purchase or lease commercial housing as long-term residences,
however, EPA and HUD believe it is consistent with the statute that such establishments be considered target housing
under this proposed rule's requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
0-Bedroom dwelling
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means any residential dwelling in which the living area is unseparated from the sleeping area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD are proposing this definition to clarify the term used in the Act's definition of target housing. Under
this definition, efficiency, studio apartments, loft space, and single-room dormitory units would be considered
0-bedroom dwellings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Proposed Regulatory Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018 requires EPA and HUD to promulgate joint regulations for disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in target
housing which is offered for sale or lease. Specifically, section 1018 requires that before purchasers or lessees
become obligated under any purchase or lease contract, sellers or lessors must provide the purchaser or lessee with
a lead information pamphlet (being developed by EPA under TSCA section 406) and disclose any lead-based paint or lead-based
paint hazards known to the seller or lessor in such housing. In addition, before obligating purchasers under a contract
to purchase the housing, sellers must permit purchasers a 10-day period to conduct a risk assessment or inspection
for the presence of lead-based paint hazards, and must attach a specific lead warning statement and acknowledgement,
signed by the purchaser, to each contract. Violation of Section 1018 may result in civil and criminal penalties, and
potential triple damages in a private civil suit. In this unit, EPA and HUD present a more detailed discussion of these
requirements as proposed in the EPA and HUD regulations. As noted above, EPA and HUD are proposing joint and equivalent
regulations that would appear in Title 40 of the CFR with other EPA lead regulations and in Title 24 of the CFR with other
HUD lead regulations. Including the joint regulations in both CFR locations will help ensure that sellers, lessors,
agents, buyers, and lessees are informed of their existence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Disclosure Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018(a)(1)(B) of the Act requires the seller or lessor of target housing to provide all information known
to the seller or lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in the housing to the purchaser or lessee before
the purchaser or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or lease target housing. EPA and HUD are proposing
such a disclosure requirement in 24 CFR 38.20 and 40 CFR 745.107. Under the proposed regulations, the seller or lessor,
or the agent acting on behalf of the seller or lessor, is required to provide the purchaser or lessee with written documentation
of all information known to the seller or lessor, or the agent regarding the presence of lead-based paint or lead-based
paint hazards associated with the housing being sold or leased. Consistent with the statute, records of this information
must be provided to the purchaser or lessee before they become obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the
target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this proposed rule, EPA and HUD propose that ``information known to the seller or lessor'' comprise,
at minimum, the information described in 24 CFR 38.20 and 40 CFR 745.107 of these regulations. The proposed information
would include, but not be limited to, the following items: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Reports from all lead-based paint inspections, risk assessments, and abatement activities known to the seller
or lessor and conducted on or in the target housing, including any known reports completed before the effective date
of the final rule if such reports are available to the seller or lessor on or after the effective date. Section 1018(a)(1)(B)
requires sellers or lessors of target housing to ``provide to the purchaser or lessee any lead hazard evaluation report
available to the seller or lessor.'' EPA and HUD recognize that reports from some lead-based paint activities conducted
before the effective date of the final rule may no longer be available to the seller or lessor given that the seller or
lessor had not been put on notice that disclosure of such records would be required. However, those reports in the possession
of the seller or lessor on or after November 2, 1994 would become part of the permanent record for that unit of target
housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Records of lead-based paint inspections, assessments, and abatement activities conducted for current or past
sellers or lessors in common areas of target housing containing more than one residential dwelling. EPA and HUD are
concerned that lead-based paint in common areas may pose an additional exposure risk to occupants, especially in
buildings where lead-based paint chips and dust are allowed to accumulate. Also, the presence of lead-based paint
in common areas of buildings containing target housing may signal the presence of lead-based paint within the residential
dwellings. For these reasons, EPA and HUD are proposing to require the disclosure of records and reports of lead-based
paint in common areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Information known to the seller or lessor regarding whether other residential dwellings in the target housing
contain or have contained lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards. This would only apply to target housing containing
more than one residential dwelling, and would be of primary value in cases where information on lead-based paint and
lead-based paint hazards only exists for some, but not all residential dwellings. The presence of lead-based paint
in some of the residential dwellings may suggest a greater likelihood of lead-based paint existing in the residential
dwellings that have yet to be tested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To balance the indirect value of the information with the disclosure burden of providing such information during
transactions, EPA and HUD propose to require that sellers/lessors disclose only whether or not lead-based paint
is or has been present in other residential dwellings within the target housing, rather than requiring that sellers
and lessors provide specific reports on those residential dwellings. The seller or lessor would, of course, retain
the option of providing more detailed information, but would not be required to provide specific data on each residential
dwelling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD believe that such information will help potential occupants make more informed decisions when considering
leasing or purchasing target housing. For example, such information could persuade purchasers to exercise their
option to conduct an inspection or risk assessment before purchasing the property. Similarly, knowledge of lead-based
paint on the premises could prompt lessees to take greater precautions to guard against exposure. EPA and HUD request
comment on whether requiring disclosure of information regarding other residential units is warranted and, if so,
whether a more stringent disclosure standard is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Other available information that may indicate lead-based paint or a lead-based paint hazard in the unit. This proposed
requirement is directed at other relevant information on lead-based paint hazards that may be known by the seller
or lessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD request information and comment on other appropriate information that may be commonly available to owners
of target housing and which should be itemized in the final rule. For example, should information on past cases of lead-poisoning
of occupants be disclosed to purchasers or lessees? If such information is to be considered, what level of detail would
be appropriate given the privacy implications of medical records? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA and HUD request comment on whether the final rule should impose specific recordkeeping requirements
on owners of target housing to retain information known to the owner on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards,
as identified in proposed 24 CFR 35.20 and 40 CFR 745.107. If promulgated, the time period for such a recordkeeping
requirement for owners of target housing could range in length from the length of ownership to a discrete number of
years (3 years, 5 years, 10 years, etc), based on its feasibility and utility in ensuring compliance with the regulations.
In evaluating the value of an owner record retention requirement, EPA and HUD will consider its potential value both
in aiding and supporting Agency enforcement efforts as well as its potential value in supporting civil actions for
damages taken under section 1018(b)(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Lead-Hazard Information Pamphlet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018(a)(1)(A) requires that sellers and lessors of target housing provide the purchaser or lessee with a
copy of the EPA pamphlet 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead Paint: Protect Your Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 before the purchaser or lessee is obligated under any contract to purchase or lease the housing. A primary function
of the pamphlet is to educate families on the potential health risks associated with lead exposure and ways to avoid
such exposure. By requiring that families receive the pamphlet at the beginning of the real estate transaction, Congress
ensured that families would be informed about lead-based paint issues during the transaction process. Therefore,
the joint provisions of these regulations (located in &sect;&sect;38.20(a) and 745.107(a) of the proposed regulatory
text) would require that purchasers and lessees receive the pamphlet before becoming obligated under any contract.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft pamphlet was developed by EPA in consultation with HUD and CDC and was released to the public for a 60&hyph;day
comment period and announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994, (59 FR 11119). In addition, EPA has conducted a series of focus tests and interviews in different regions
of the country to ensure that the pamphlet meets both high technical and editorial standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final pamphlet will be made available to the public through the Government Printing Office (GPO) for a nominal
fee. In addition, EPA will make a limited number of camera-ready copies of the final pamphlet available to organizations
that wish to print copies for private distribution, and the pamphlet will be available in electronic form through
the GPO Bulletin Board. EPA and HUD are continuing to explore methods for printing and distributing the pamphlet in
a quick and inexpensive way to the regulated community and the general public at large. EPA and HUD welcome comment
on other potential distribution methods for the pamphlet.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Disclosure and Acknowledgment Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requiring written documentation of the information known by the seller or lessor, defined in proposed
24 CFR 38.20(b) and 40 CFR 745.107(b) of the regulatory text, EPA and HUD have developed disclosure and acknowledgement
forms to be attached to all sales and leasing contracts for target housing. Form A for sellers and Form B for lessors
are included as Appendix A to the proposed HUD regulatory text. EPA and HUD believe that the forms will help ensure that
(1) All information known to the seller or lessor on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards is disclosed and
documented, (2) all purchasers and lessees are aware of their rights under the provisions of section 1018, and (3)
sellers, lessors, and agents are aware of their obligations under their rule. In addition, these forms would be an
important enforcement tool by providing a record of compliance with the rule. By maintaining completed forms after
a transaction to purchase or lease target housing, the seller, lessor, and agents would have documentation of their
compliance with the disclosure activities and of the purchaser's/lessee's receipt and acknowledgement. Because
sellers and lessors have different obligations under the requirements mandated by section 1018, EPA and HUD believe
that it is appropriate to provide two separate and distinct forms for the two types of transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD initially considered including the elements in the forms as separate provisions for inclusion in the leasing
or purchase contracts themselves. Ultimately, that concept was rejected because it would be more burdensome and
confusing. By creating one form covering all regulated parties for each type of transaction, EPA and HUD hope to minimize
confusion over the new requirements, decrease the recordkeeping burden, and ensure a greater level of compliance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Form for Transactions to Sell Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, EPA and HUD are proposing in &sect;&sect;745.107(a)(4) and 38.20(a)(4), respectively,
that each contract to sell property defined as target housing contain a signed and dated copy of the joint HUD/EPA form
entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure and Acknowledgement of Lead-Based Paint Before Sale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The form is divided into four distinct parts: a general notice statement, a certification of compliance statement
by the seller, a certification of compliance statement by the agent (where applicable), and an acknowledgement statement
by the purchaser. Each part is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice to purchasers of target housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 1018(a)(3) of the Act provides a specific ``lead warning statement'' to be included in all contracts involving
the purchase and sale of any interest in target housing. The statute states that the lead warning statement shall contain
the required language printed in large type on a separate sheet of paper attached to the contract. Because the disclosure
and acknowledgement form would serve as an attachment to the contract, EPA and HUD propose to include this lead warning
statement as the first part of the form, and to print it in a larger type than the rest of the form to ensure its prominence.
The required text would read: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Every purchaser of any interest in residential real property on which a residential dwelling was built prior to 1978
is notified that such property may present exposure to lead from lead-based paint that may place young children at
risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children may produce permanent neurological damage,
including learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems, and impaired memory. Lead
poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The seller of any interest in residential real property
is required to provide the buyer with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments or inspections
in the seller's possession and notify the buyer of any known lead-based paint hazards. A risk assessment or inspection
for possible lead-based paint hazards is recommended prior to purchase. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, EPA and HUD propose that, in cases where the sales contract is written in a language other than English,
the lead warning statement must be included in the language of the contract as well, based on a translation of the English-version
lead warning statement. While this is not expressly required by the statute, such a requirement would be consistent
with Congress' intent of ensuring that families be fully aware of the potential hazards of lead-based paint before
purchasing target housing. EPA and HUD request comment on this proposed requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of compliance statement by the seller
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second part of the form would require the seller to list all information known to the seller on lead-based paint
and lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. EPA and HUD believe that it is necessary to create a single record
of the information provided by the lessor/owner. Completion of this part would ensure that at the time of the contract
agreement, both the seller and the purchaser would be aware of the disclosure requirements under these regulations
and the lead-based paint hazard information being disclosed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If information described in Part II of the form is in the possession of the seller, the seller would be required to provide
the information in written form to the purchaser, check the appropriate box, and note the dates and type of known information
in the space provided. This information would be a necessary record during the disclosure process, both to inform
the purchaser of the information the purchaser should have received, and as a later measure of compliance by the seller
and the seller's agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of compliance statement by the agent
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The third part of the form would require an agent, if one is used, to certify that the requirements of section 1018 have
been satisfied, either by the seller or by the agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acknowledgement of lead-based paint requirements in target housing by the purchaser
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 1018(a)(2) requires that contracts to purchase target property include an acknowledgement signed by purchasers.
EPA and HUD propose that the purchaser indicate the following in the acknowledgement: That they have read and understood
the lead warning statement, received any information on lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards noted in the
seller certification, received a lead hazard information pamphlet, and that they are aware that they must receive
an opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase the property.
In the fourth part of the form, EPA and HUD propose such an acknowledgement. The acknowledgement would state: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I acknowledge that I have read and understood the attached lead warning statement in Part I of this form, received the
information noted in Part II of this form, received the lead hazard information pamphlet 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Lead-Based Paint: Protect Your Family
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition, I acknowledge that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4852(d) and its implementing regulations, the attached contract
entitles me to up to 10 calendar days to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for the presence of lead-based paint
hazards before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase, unless I agree otherwise in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Form for Transactions to Lease Target Housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD are proposing in &sect;&sect;745.107(a)(5) and 38.20(a)(5), respectively, that each contract to lease
target housing contain a signed and dated copy of the joint HUD/EPA form entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosure and Acknowledgement of Lead-Based Paint Before Lease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The form is divided into four distinct parts: a general notice statement, a certification of compliance statement
by the lessor, a certification of compliance statement by the agent (where applicable), and an acknowledgement statement
by the lessee. Each part is discussed below; however, where statutory justifications and background are the same
as that presented in the part on the form for sales of target housing, the repetitive elements have been omitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Notice to residents of target housing
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. EPA and HUD propose to include a tailored lead warning statement as the first part of the form, and to print it in a larger
type than the rest of the form to ensure its prominence. Although not specifically required by section 1018, EPA and
HUD believe that this statement provides a useful context for information disclosed to lessees, just as for purchasers,
concerning the hazards of lead-based paint. The required text would read: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A residential structure built prior to 1978 may present exposure to lead from lead-based paint. This exposure may
place young children at risk of developing lead poisoning. Lead poisoning in young children can produce permanent
neurological damage, including learning disabilities, reduced intelligence quotient, behavioral problems,
and impaired memory. Lead poisoning also poses a particular risk to pregnant women. The lessor of any residential
dwelling is required to provide the lessee with any information on lead-based paint hazards from risk assessments
or inspections in the lessor's possession and notify the lessee of any known lead-based paint hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, EPA and HUD propose that, in cases where the lease is written in a language other than English, a translation
of this lead warning statement would be required to be attached in the language of the contract. EPA and HUD believe
that this translation requirement may be even more critical in the case of leasing transactions than in purchases
as many non-English speakers may be more likely to lease housing for themselves and their families. EPA and HUD request
comment on this proposed requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification of compliance statement by the lessor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second part of the form would require the lessor to list all information known to the lessor on lead-based paint
and lead-based paint hazards in the target housing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If information listed in Part II of the form is in the possession of the lessor, the lessor would be required to provide

EPA and HUD request comments on all aspects of the disclosure and acknowledgement forms. Specific questions include:

is not required by the statute unnecessary?

4. Retention of Disclosure and Acknowledgment Form
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The disclosure and acknowledgement form documents the fulfillment of the mandated disclosure requirements during
the sale or lease of target housing. This record, if maintained by the seller or lessor after the completion of the transaction,
would provide a valuable record of the fulfillment of these requirements to both the agencies and courts. If this record
were not regularly maintained, EPA and HUD are concerned that they would have little ability to determine whether
the necessary disclosure steps had occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For that reason, proposed &sect;&sect;38.20 and 745.107 of the regulatory text would require that the signed notice
and disclosure form be maintained by sellers, lessors, and agents for a full 3 years from: (a) The commencement of the
lease period in the case of a transaction to lease target housing, or (b) the completion of the sale in the case of a sale
of target housing. EPA and HUD chose 3 years as the retention period for the disclosure form in order to allow adequate
time for enforcement action by HUD or EPA. If the regulation were to mandate a shorter period of time, Federal enforcement
actions could be hampered, undermining the efficacy of the regulations mandated by statute. EPA and HUD are concerned
that requiring a longer retention period would place an undue burden on the regulated community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD have not identified any less burdensome alternative to support compliance monitoring and enforcement
actions but are sensitive to the need to impose minimum recordkeeping burdens on the regulated community, especially
given the large number of transactions affected. The agencies are willing to consider alternatives to the proposed
requirements, including the reduction or omission of recordkeeping requirements, if the alternatives would still
ensure the successful administration and enforcement of the provisions of section 1018 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such alternatives could include the imposition of a longer or shorter retention period for the disclosure form, or
the addition or substitution of other records as part of a post-transaction recordkeeping requirement. EPA is also
considering the potential efficacy of instituting recordkeeping requirements with a sunset provision, which would
phase them out over time as the market increasingly embraced and institutionalized the disclosure process. Regardless
of what recordkeeping time limits the agencies impose, these limits would not effect time limits on lawsuits under
section 1018(b)(3) by injured parties against former sellers, lessors, or agents who fail to comply with these regulations.
For this reason EPA and HUD would encourage sellers, lessors, and agents to maintain signed, dated forms beyond the
required recordkeeping period as proof of compliance.

D. 10-Day Inspection Period 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1018(a)(1)(C) of the Act requires that, before a party is obligated under any contract to purchase target
housing, the seller shall grant the purchaser a 10&hyph;day period to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for
the presence of lead-based paint hazards in target housing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA and HUD interpret the term ``10&hyph;day period'' to mean 10 calendar days. While the seller and purchaser may
mutually agree to a shorter or longer period, without written proof of an agreed upon change to the time, the legally
enforceable period would remain 10 calendar days. Given the diversity of definitions for ``business'' or ``working''
days, EPA and HUD believe that an alternative interpretation of the 10&hyph;day period would lead to confusion among
the public. In cases where a 10 calendar-day inspection or assessment period would be insufficient, the purchaser
would retain the option of negotiating in writing for a longer period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since known lead-based paint information may affect a purchaser's decision to utilize the 10&hyph;day inspection
period option, EPA and HUD propose to require that sellers perform and document all disclosure activities required
under this proposed rule before providing the purchaser with the opportunity for the 10&hyph;day period. EPA and
HUD believe that the purchaser will be most able to determine whether a risk assessment or inspection is necessary
or appropriate after receiving the disclosed information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD also believe that reports from inspections conducted during the 10&hyph;day inspection/assessment
period should become part of the permanent record retained by the owner of the housing. Therefore, EPA and HUD are also
requesting comment on whether purchasers who conduct inspections or risk assessments during the 10&hyph;day period
but who do not ultimately purchase the housing should be required, under this rulemaking, to provide a copy of any report
to the owner for their records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some purchasers and sellers may prefer to conduct the 10&hyph;day inspection/assessment period before the parties
have signed a contract for the purchase and sale of the target housing. Others may prefer to conduct the inspection
period after the contract is signed. In implementing these requirements, EPA and HUD have considered several approaches
to fulfilling the statutory provision that the purchaser receive the opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period
before becoming obligated under a contract to purchase the housing. These regulations propose several approaches
to Federal implementation of the 10&hyph;day inspection period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1. Require Contract Language Addressing Outcome of Inspection (Preferred Option) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To insure that the purchaser receives the statutorily required 10&hyph;day opportunity to conduct a risk assessment
or inspection before
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 becoming obligated under the contract, the proposed regulation (24 CFR 38.21 and 40 CFR 745.110) requires that, if
the parties elect to ratify the contract prior to completion of the 10&hyph;day opportunity, the seller or agent must
include appropriate language in the contract to reflect that the contract shall be contingent on the condition that
no lead-based paint hazard is found in the inspection or risk assessment. If a lead-based paint hazard is found during
the inspection or risk assessment, the seller and purchaser would mutually determine the terms under which the sale
will or will not proceed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2. Base Regulatory Text on Statutory Language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The least prescriptive option for implementing section 1018(a)(1)(C) requirement for a 10&hyph;day inspection
opportunity is to state in the regulation simply that ``the seller shall provide the purchaser with an opportunity
for a 10&hyph;day inspection period (unless the parties agree to a mutually agreed upon different period of time)
before becoming obligated under the contract to purchase the housing to conduct a risk assessment or inspection for
the presence of lead-based paint hazards.'' While this option would provide the regulated community with flexibility
in determining how to comply, EPA and HUD are concerned that the lack of detail would provide inadequate guidance to
the regulated community, regarding the measures needed for proper compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3. Mandate Specific Contingency Language for All Contracts Completed Before Inspection or Assessment Period

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD are considering the merit of requiring that all contracts to purchase target housing include specific
language mandated by HUD and EPA addressing the purchaser's opportunity for a 10&hyph;day inspection period. In
addition to further informing the purchaser of his/her rights to the inspection/assessment period, EPA and HUD could
provide specific language addressing the rights of the purchaser in cases where the inspection/assessment period
was provided after the purchaser had signed a contract to purchase the target housing. These requirements have the
advantage of providing a clear message regarding what the seller and agent must do to comply and regarding what rights
the purchaser has in cases where the purchaser does not receive the inspection or assessment period until after having
signed a contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 4. Require the Inspection/Assessment Period Before the Contract is Signed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD also requests comment on requiring that the 10&hyph;day opportunity for inspection or assessment be provided
before the purchaser signs a contract for the purchase of target housing. This would ensure that all purchasers were
aware of the presence of any lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards before they entered into the contract to
purchase the housing. EPA and HUD do not currently prefer to impose such a prescriptive requirement on the real estate
community; however, recognizing that both purchasers and sellers may prefer, at times, to implement the inspection
period after all parties have acknowledged serious interest in completing the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA and HUD request comment on whether more prescriptive regulations would be of value regarding exactly
what level or conditions of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards would allow for purchasers to escape their
obligation under a contract signed before the inspection. Alternatively, the agencies would also like comment on
whether the regulatory language and safeguards being proposed may be overly prescriptive regarding implementation
of the 10&hyph;day opportunity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Role of Agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As set forth in section 1018(a)(4) of the Act, agents entering into a contract with a seller or lessor to sell or lease
target housing must ensure compliance with all requirements imposed upon the seller or lessor under section 1018.
If the sale or lease of target housing was aided or accomplished by an agent who has entered into a contract with a seller
or lessor, the agent can be held liable for their failure to comply with the requirements of section 1018 and the regulations
and can be liable for all penalties, both criminal and civil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD propose to impose an affirmative obligation on agents to advise the seller of the provisions of the rule,
including the seller's obligation to inform the agent of lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards in the target
housing. The language of the disclosure form reflects this notification requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a method for demonstrating compliance, EPA and HUD have proposed a requirement that agents sign and maintain copies
of the signed notice and disclosure forms from each sale or lease of target housing. As proposed for sellers and lessors,
the agent would have to maintain these records for 3 years from the commencement of the leasing period or for 3 years
from the completion of the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining an appropriate recordkeeping requirement, EPA and HUD considered both the burden on the regulated
community and the information and duration necessary to ensure adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement
of the rule's provisions. EPA and HUD rejected the ``no-recordkeeping requirement'' for agents because it would
hinder Federal compliance assurance activities and make it difficult to determine whether a disclosure had taken
place. Similarly, a recordkeeping requirement of less than 3 years would provide inadequate time for inspection
of records and initiation of appropriate enforcement actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If no agents were employed during the leasing or purchasing process, then all liability for failure to adhere to the
proposed requirements would rest solely with the seller or lessor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD request comment on the rule's proposed definition of agent (see Unit IV of the preamble and &sect;&sect;38.15
and 745.103 of the regulatory text) and on the interpretation of their compliance assurance provision in section
1018(a)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018(a)(1) of the Act directs EPA and HUD to jointly issue these requirements as final regulations by October
28, 1994, and pursuant to section 1018(d), the regulations will take effect on October 28, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 1018 specified that final regulations should be promulgated no later than October 28, 1994, EPA/HUD
will not be able to meet this deadline. It appears that Congress' intent in section 1018 was to provide a year between
the promulgation of the final rule, and the effective date of the rule. Congress reasonably could have felt that this
year was necessary in order that the real estate industry, landlords, sellers, etc. could become familiar with the
rule requirements and set up procedures for compliance. For this reason, EPA/HUD believe that the effective date
of the rule should be no early than 1 year after promulgation of the final rule, even if this means occurring later than
October 28, 1995, as mandated by section 1018. EPA and HUD believe that this interpretation is the one most consistent
with Congressional intent.

VII. Non-Compliance and Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to civil liability under section 1018(b)(3), section 1018 provides both EPA and HUD with other enforcement
authority for these requirements. The enforcement authority is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. HUD Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018(b)(1) of the Act authorizes HUD to impose civil monetary penalties on any person who knowingly violates
section 1018. HUD interprets this authority to apply to violators of the regulations under section 1018 as well. HUD
shall impose penalties under section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 [42
U.S.C. 3545]. These penalties may be up to $10,000 for each violation. In addition, section 1018(b)(2) of the Act authorizes
the Secretary of HUD to ``take such lawful action as may be necessary to enjoin any violation'' of the rule's provisions.
Section 1018(b)(5) provides that any violation of section 1018 will be a violation of section 409. Section 412(a)
of TSCA provides that the U.S. district courts have jurisdiction to restrain any violation of section 409 of TSCA.
Thus, the district courts will have jurisdiction over violations of section 1018. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. EPA Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Civil
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1018(b)(5) of the Act provides that failure or refusal to comply with section 1018 or its implementing regulations
is a violation of TSCA section 409. Violations of TSCA section 409 are subject to TSCA section 16 penalties. Thus, a
violator of section 1018 will be subject to penalties under TSCA section 16 of up to $10,000 for each violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Criminal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since TSCA section 16 includes violations under section 409, TSCA section 16(b) provides that any person who knowingly
or willfully violates section 409 (and thus section 1018) would, in addition to or instead of any civil penalty, be
subject, upon conviction, to a fine of not more than $10,000 for each day of violation or to imprisonment for not more
than 1 year, or both. As violations of each provision can only occur one time during each transaction (as opposed to
on a daily basis), the $10,000 penalty may be interpreted as ``for each violation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Civil Liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the EPA and HUD enforcement authority for the provisions of this proposed rule, under section 1018(b)(3)
of the Act, ``Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of this section shall be jointly and severally liable
to the purchaser or lessee in an amount equal to 3 times the amount of damages incurred by such individual.'' This provision
allows the purchaser or lessee to seek direct compensation for any damages incurred based on the seller or lessor's
noncompliance. Section 1018(b)(4) authorizes the court to award court costs, reasonable attorney fees, and expert
witness fees to the plaintiff if the plaintiff prevails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Validity of Contracts and Liens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1018(c) provides that nothing in section 1018 (or implementing rules) shall affect the validity or enforceability
of any sale or contract for the purchase and sale or lease of any interest in residential real property or any loan, loan
agreement, mortgage, or lien, made or arising in connection with a mortgage loan.'' It also provides that nothing
in section 1018 (or its implementing rules) shall ``create a defect in title.'' EPA and HUD have looked at section 1018(c)
in the context of other section 1018 provisions, which outline specific clauses which must be attached to contracts
for the purchase and sale of target housing, and specific procedural protections which must be given to the purchaser/lessee.
EPA and HUD interpret section 1018 as a whole to provide that, once the contract is ratified, if certain attachments
are not included in the ratified contract and if certain protections afforded in section 1018 were not given to the
lessee/purchaser, the remedy available to the purchaser or lessee under section 1018 against the seller or lessor
would be monetary damages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears clear from the language of section 1018(c), that such an injured purchaser/lessee could not void or nullify
the contract after ratification and could not void any transfer of real estate, through the use of section 1018 authority,
even if it could be proven that the seller/lessor violated section 1018 provisions. Congress appears to have wanted
to avoid upsetting real estate transactions once they were completed, and to have intended to limit the purchaser/lessee's
remedies to civil damage suits. Also, Congress appears to have wanted not to create an independent cause of action
for breach of contract or for any breach associated with real estate transfers through the use of section 1018. Of course,
traditional causes of action under state law for misrepresentation/fraud would still exist, and possibly could
be applied to some section 1018 violations. Also, violations of section 1018 would be subject to civil and criminal
penalties administered by EPA and HUD under section 1018(b).

VIII. Procedures for Requesting a Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act mandates Federal involvement in housing transactions at an unprecedented level. Recognizing the broad scope
of these provisions, EPA and HUD will consider holding an informal hearing for public comment on this proposed rule
in Washington, DC. To ensure adequate preparation for the hearing by all parties involved, persons or organizations
desiring to participate in an informal hearing must file a written request for a hearing or to participate in any such
hearing. The written request must be sent to the Environmental Assistance Division at the address listed under 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The written request to participate must include: (1) A brief statement of the interest of the person or organization
in the proceeding; (2) a brief outline of the points to be addressed; (3) an estimate of the time required; and (4) if
the request comes from an organization, a non-binding list of the persons to take part in the presentation. The request
must be received by December 2, 1994. Should a hearing be held, organizations are requested to bring with them, to the
extent possible, employees with individual expertise in and responsibility for each one of the areas to be addressed.
Organizations which do not file written comments in response to the proposed rule will not be allowed to participate
at the hearing.

IX. Summary of Regulatory Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) examining the potential costs, benefits, and impacts of regulations
for the disclosure of lead-based paint hazards in residential property upon the transfer of the property for sale
or rental. The analysis is presented in five sections: &bull;Framework for Analyzing the Costs of the Lead-Based

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Framework for Analyzing the Costs of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those parties directly affected by the proposed rule are the seller, lessor, agent, property manager, buyer, and
tenant. EPA found the required activities which give rise to regulatory burden imposed on the affected parties to
fall into four categories for cost estimation purposes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Start-up costs, which include learning the rule's requirements and establishing compliance procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Disclosure activities, which refers to the costs resulting from the actual transfer of information and obtaining
of needed signatures. &bull;Recordkeeping, which results from the requirement that signed acknowledgement forms
must be retained by the provider of the information. &bull;Materials, which are linked primarily to the disclosure
requirement, as the lead hazard information pamphlet must be purchased or photocopied (acknowedgement forms must
also be duplicated). Costs may also be incurred for filing where a high number of acknowledgement forms are generated
(e.g., agents), though such burden was estimated to be quite modest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements of section 1018 of the Act fall primarily on the seller or lessor of ``target housing,'' which is defined
to be any housing constructed prior to 1978, except housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities (unless any
child who is less than 6 years of age resides or is expected to reside in such housing) or any 0 bedroom dwelling. However,
if an agent or property manager acts on behalf of the seller or lessor, which EPA has estimated to be the case in the great
majority of transfers, the responsibilities fall to such agents or managers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To estimate the cost impacts of the proposed rule, data were sought pertaining to the number of affected parties in
each classification listed above, the frequency with which affected purchase and lease transactions are completed,
and the incremental costs, in labor and materials, added to each transaction by the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Profile of Sectors Affected by the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The larger of the two affected sectors expected to bear the principal effects of the proposed rule falls within Standard
Industrial Classification (SIC) code 651, Real Estate Operators and Lessors. EPA estimates there to be 96,000 establishments
potentially affected by the proposed rule. Also affected are business establishments falling within SIC code 653,
Real Estate Agents and Managers; an estimated 72,000 establishments could be affected by the proposed rule. Employment
data for these industries were obtained for occupations most likely to be involved in transactions subject to the
rule. EPA estimates that 339,000 real estate agents and 225,000 property managers will be affected. With regard to
transaction volume, EPA found that 2.9 million sales transactions and 9.3 million rental transactions occur annually
in target housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Estimated Costs to Private Parties from the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table 1 below presents a summary of the estimated annual compliance costs associated with the proposed rule. Each
of the four cost categories appearing in the table are discussed briefly below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category, start-up costs, represents about one-third of overall annual costs. Factors affecting the magnitude
of these costs include the number of employees having to familiarize themselves with the regulations, both initially
(employees in the existing workforce) and over time (new entrants to the affected sectors); the time required to learn
the activities which must be undertaken in order to comply; and the hourly compensation of affected employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is evident from Table 1 below, disclosure event costs constitute the greatest portion of overall costs. Factors
affecting the magnitude of these costs include the frequencies of regulated events; the time involved in performing
required activities, such as providing the prospective purchaser/tenant with the required information and obtaining
the required signatures; and the hourly compensation of all involved parties. EPA also took into account the fact
that a number of States have similar requirements pertaining to information transfer regarding potential lead hazards
in the sale of residential property. Thus, an allowance was made in the burden estimates for transactions occurring
in such States to reflect a certain level of current compliance.

Effect of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers on Small Businesses - Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA investigated the potential impacts of the proposed rule on small businesses, and has prepared an Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). While a large number of small establishments will be potentially affected by the rule,
cost impacts were not found to be of sufficient magnitude to cause undue harm to such establishments. Consequently,
no regulatory alternatives are being proposed in connection with small business impacts. The IRFA is summarized
separately below in Unit XI.C of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment of the Benefits of the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Disclosure Rule for Real Estate Transfers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market imperfection that the proposed rule is intended to correct is the lack of information available to prospective
home buyers and renters on lead-based paint hazards in homes they may be considering for purchase or rent. Under the
proposed rule, general information about risks associated with lead-based paint will be provided (through the provision
of a brochure) and, when available, information about the presence of or abatement of lead in the specific unit being
considered for purchase or rent must also be disclosed (e.g., information concerning previous testing for the presence
of lead-based paint, abatement history, evidence of previous poisoning, etc.). The failure of the marketplace to
provide this information or to provide prospective home buyers and renters the opportunity to develop such information
means that prospective buyers and renters might purchase or lease a property, or make pricing or rental payment decisions
regarding properties, without understanding possible lead-related health risks or risk management costs accompanying
the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD expect that this rulemaking will generate benefits by providing prospective home buyers and renters access
to information which they otherwise may not have been able to acquire, such as information pertaining to abatement
activities for a specific residence, or, in the case of more general information, which they may have been able to acquire
only through their own effort at some cost. In addition, EPA believes the information will generate health benefits
by leading many buyers and renters to modify their behavior in a way that will reduce risks from lead-based paint. For
example, purchasers could undertake abatement activities subsequent to taking ownership of a dwelling, change
household cleaning practices, or request professional assistance when undertaking renovation activities. The
proposed rule may also prompt property owners, due to reluctance on the part of prospective buyers/renters to select
housing containing lead-based paint, to act to reduce lead-related hazards associated with their residential dwellings.
In cases where action is taken to remediate a lead-based paint hazard, additional costs would be incurred, and would
have to be subtracted from the expected benefits associated with the remediation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA and HUD note that the regulation does not require actions to be taken to reduce lead-based paint hazards in residential
housing; thus, the extent to which health benefits accrue depends upon how transaction participants, that is, sellers/lessors
and prospective buyers/renters, value and respond to the additional information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the RIA, three approaches are detailed that are evolving and can be seen as a starting point in an effort to expand
the level of understanding of how benefits from information products can be valued. However, an information base
and the associated accepted analytic methods necessary to predict consumer reaction to information products on
lead-based paint hazards are not readily available; thus, quantifying the expected benefits of this proposed rule
would be extremely difficult. Given the high level of uncertainty associated with the results from such a quantitative
analysis, and given the prescriptive nature of section 1018 of the Act, EPA and HUD believe that the information provided
in the qualitative analysis presented in the RIA served to inform decisionmaking. EPA invites comment, however,
on its benefits analysis and on alternative approaches to assessing the benefits of the proposed rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
While EPA and HUD do not anticipate the receipt of much (if any) confidential business information (CBI) in connection
with this rulemaking, a person may assert a claim of confidentiality for any information, including all or portions
of written comments, submitted in connection with the proposed rule. Any person who submits a comment subject to a
claim of confidentiality must also submit a nonconfidential version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany
the information when it is submitted. Persons must label information claimed as confidential by circling, bracketing,
or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or some other appropriate designation. A determination
of whether information will be disclosed will be made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act. If a person does not
assert a claim of confidentiality for information in comments at the time they are submitted to EPA, EPA will place
the information in the public record for this rulemaking without further notice to that person.

XIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local, or significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken
or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grant, user fees, or
loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising
out of legal mandates, the Presidents priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because it is raising novel policy issues arising out of its legal mandate. As such, this action was submitted
to OMB for review, and any comments or changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations have been documented
in the public record. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to perform a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' In an effort
to identify and characterize the proposed rule's effects on small business, EPA and HUD have prepared an Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA). This assessment has been included as part of the RIA, and is summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In preparing the IRFA, EPA and HUD first developed an establishment profile for each major sector (SIC 651 and SIC 653).
This profile indicated that approximately 75 percent of all establishments in SIC 651 (Real Estate Operators and
Lessors) and approximately 71 percent of all establishments in SIC 653 (Real Estate Agents and Managers) fell within
the 1 to 4 employee size class. These proportions increased to 90 percent and 86 percent, respectively, when employee
size class 1 to 9 was examined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To measure the cost impacts of the proposed rule on these small establishments, representative, or model establishments
were designed. These model establishments corresponded to typical establishments, with respect to number of employees
and annual transaction volume, in each affected sector. Since transaction activity was reported to vary widely,
a range of transaction volume was estimated for each establishment type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each model establishment, annual regulatory costs were then calculated and compared to annual labor and overhead
costs. Ratios were computed for both high and low estimates of the range of transaction activity. In the case of a real
estate sales organization, regulatory costs were found to represent from 0.18 to 0.38 percent of labor and overhead
costs. In the case of a rental establishment, impacts were slightly higher, ranging from 0.20 to 0.46 percent. An establishment
engaged in both activities was projected to sustain impacts of 0.26 to 0.59 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, while a large number of small establishments will be potentially affected by the rule, cost impacts were not
found to be of sufficient magnitude to cause undue harm to such establishments. Consequently, no regulatory alternatives
are being proposed in connection with small business impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this proposed rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An Information Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA and HUD (ICR No. 1710.01) and a copy may
be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch (MC-2136), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information that would be associated with this proposed rule is estimated to have a public burden
averaging 19.5 minutes per response (at 6.5 minutes per an average of 3 respondents), and to require 15.4 minutes per
respondent, annually. This includes time for gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing
the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (MC-2136); Environmental Protection Agency; 401 M
St., SW; Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or
public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule.

I. Introduction and Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing to amend its rules governing disclosure
of broker-dealer payment for order flow and the practice of executing orders as principal or routing orders to an affiliated
broker-dealer or exchange specialist (``internalized/affiliate practices''), Rule 10b&hyph;10 (17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;10)
and Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 (17 CFR 240.11Ac1&hyph;3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). As described
below and in a related release, both payment for order flow and internalized/affiliate practices have been the subject
of extensive debate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed Rule amendments regarding payment for order flow also are intended to enhance disclosure to customers
of compensation their broker-dealer may receive from market centers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendments would require broker-dealers receiving payment for order flow to provide customers additional information
regarding the value of the compensation received. The proposed additional disclosures would include, for monetary
payment for order flow, the range of payments received on a per share basis and on an aggregate basis annually, and for
non-monetary payment for order flow, an estimate of the range of payment for order flow on a per share basis and on an
aggregate basis annually. These disclosures would be required when a customer opens an account, on an annual basis
thereafter, and in abbreviated fashion on required confirmations. The proposed amendments would require similar
disclosure with respect to the value of order flow subject to internalized/affiliate practices.

The Commission is also soliciting comment whether certain inducements to routing order flow should be included in
the definition of payment for order flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also is proposing that broker-dealers disclose to their customers information regarding their order
routing practices generally, regardless of whether they receive payment for order flow or engage in internalized/affiliate
practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments regarding internalized/affiliate practices are intended to address comments the Commission
received in connection with its consideration of payment for order flow practices and to elicit further discussion
regarding their implications. In connection with the Adopting Release, six commenters indicated that the internalization
of order flow by broker-dealers presents issues similar to those commonly associated with payment for order flow.
These commenters argued that the opportunity to capture the spread through internalized/affiliate practices encourages
broker-dealers to execute orders in house or to send orders to an affiliated broker-dealer or exchange specialist.
At the most basic level, under each practice the broker-dealer is influenced with respect to where it will route customer
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would require broker-dealers to inform customers on new account and annual disclosure statements
whether they execute orders as principal or route those orders to affiliated firms. These amendments are designed
to provide customers with more information about firms' order routing decisions, especially in light of changes
that might result from requiring additional disclosure of payment for order flow practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed rule amendments would extend confirmation and account statement disclosure of payment for
order flow to transactions in standardized options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Adopting Release issued today, the Commission adopted requirements for additional disclosure of payment
for order flow practices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would require broker-dealers to provide more detailed information to customers regarding
payment for order flow. The proposed amendments would require broker-dealers receiving monetary payment for order
flow to disclose the range of payments received on a per share basis and the aggregate amount of payment for order flow
received on an annual basis, and, for non-monetary payment for order flow, to disclose an estimate of the range of non-monetary
payment for order flow received by the broker-dealer on a per share basis and on an aggregate basis annually.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definition of Payment for Order Flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in the Adopting Release, adopted a definition of payment for order flow that includes monetary payments,
services, property or any other benefit offered for order flow that results in remuneration to the firm in return for
the routing of customer orders for execution. As discussed below, the proposed amendments would establish definitions
of monetary and non-monetary payment for order flow, defining monetary payment for order flow as any monetary payment,
discount, rebate or reduction of fee to the extent that the payment, discount, rebate or reduction exceeds the fee
charged. At the same time, however, the Commission is concerned that other practices used by market centers are designed
to induce broker-dealers to direct order flow, and, therefore, may present issues similar to those practices currently
defined as payment for order flow in the Adopting Release. The Commission is soliciting comment on whether to expand
the definition of payment for order flow. Specifically, the Commission is considering expanding the definition
to include volume discounts, rebates, reductions or other inducements for order flow, even if not in excess of the
execution fee charged by a market center.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters should specifically indicate which practices should be included in the definition to provide the maximum
benefit to investors and encourage equivalent regulatory treatment among competing market centers consistent
with the purposes of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters have suggested that there is no distinction between cash payment for order flow and these inducements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Inducements for Order Flow,'' A Report to the Board of Governors, NASD, July 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also requests the views of commenters as to whether a differential in fees between competing market
centers should be considered as the economic equivalent of payment for order flow for either or both general disclosure
and quantification purposes. This differential might be viewed as affecting the order routing determination of
a broker-dealer in a manner similar to payment for order flow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also are asked to address why payment for order flow should exist in certain instances, but not others,
when the inducement for order flow to be routed to one market center or another is identical in both instances. For example,
assume that one market center currently pays $.02 per share for order flow, while a competing market center charges
a fee of $.05 per share to handle customer orders, resulting in an overall differential of $.07 per share. Under the
current definition, the first market center would be deemed to be paying for order flow, quantified as $.02 per share.
Why should payment for order flow be deemed to no longer exist where, as a result of a $.02 per share increase in costs
uniformly incurred by all market centers, the first market center simply ceased paying for order flow in favor of handling
customer orders without charge, while its competitor proportionately increased the fees charged for handling customer
orders to $.07 per share? In this instance, the first market center maintains the identical differential in terms
of the inducement to broker-dealers to direct order flow to the first market center, as opposed to the second. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a related manner, commenters are requested to indicate whether the proposed quantification of payment for order
flow (discussed more fully in the next Section) accurately reflects the inducement to a broker-dealer to route orders
to a particular market center. For instance, in the example noted above, is the amount of the inducement that should
be disclosed in connection with payment for order flow paid by the first market center $.02 per share, as would be the
case under the current definition of payment for order flow in Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3, or does the $.07 per share differential
more accurately reflect the level of inducement for order flow?

2. Quantification of Payment for Order Flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would establish definitions of ``monetary payment for order flow'' and ``non-monetary
payment for order flow.'' The term monetary payment for order flow would be defined in section 10b&hyph;10(e)(10)
to mean ``any monetary payment, discount, rebate or reduction of fee to the extent that the payment, discount, rebate
or reduction exceeds the fee charged.'' The term non-monetary payment for order flow would be defined in section 10b-10(e)(11)
to mean ``any payment for order flow received other than monetary payment for order flow.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Adopting Release, while requiring additional disclosure of payment for order flow practices, does not require
disclosure of the amount of any payment for order flow. Certain of the proposed amendments to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 would
focus on this disclosure. For monetary payment for order flow, the broker-dealer would be required by Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)
(3) and (4) to disclose the aggregate amount of monetary payment for order flow received annually, and the range of
monetary payment for order flow received on a per share basis. The proposed amendments to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a) (5)
and (6) would require broker-dealers to disclose to customers at account opening and annually thereafter, an estimate
of the aggregate value of non-monetary payment for order flow received by the broker-dealer in return for directing
order flow on an annual basis, and an estimate of the range of non-monetary payment for order flow received on a per share
basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal calls for an estimate of non-monetary payment for order flow, recognizing that precision may not be possible.
To the extent that a broker-dealer finds it difficult to estimate the per share value of non-monetary payment for order
flow, the Commission would envision permitting the broker-dealer to assume the value of the non-monetary compensation
was equal to the cash per share payment for order flow received from the same source, or, if none, similar sources. The
assumption would be that a broker-dealer, in choosing the form of payment for order flow, would demand a value that
is commensurate with the amount of cash that could be received from the same or competing market maker or specialist.
Commenters are requested to identify alternative methods by which firms might arrive at an estimate of the value of
non-monetary payment for order flow.

Commenters are also requested to indicate the extent to which valuations may vary depending on the form of non-monetary
compensation or other factors, and whether this would pose problems for estimating and disclosing the valuations.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would require an estimate of the range of non-monetary payment for order flow received by the broker-dealer
expressed on a per share basis. To comply with this requirement, broker-dealers would be expected to use the estimate
required by Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(5) in calculating the range of values to be disclosed. The proposed rule would recognize
expressly that the calculation of values represents an estimate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also is proposing to require broker-dealers who receive payment for routing orders to include information
on the confirmation. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(B) would require, for any monetary payment for order flow
received, confirmation disclosure of the range of payments received on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii)(C)
would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, an estimate by the broker-dealer of the range
in value of non-monetary compensation on a per share basis. Because it may not be possible to identify immediately
after execution which orders are subject to payment for order flow arrangements or the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
value of a specific order, the Commission is proposing to require disclosure of an estimate of the range in value of
compensation that may have been received, stated on a per share basis. Proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(a)(7)(iii) (B)
and (C) also would require, for any non-monetary payment for order flow received, a statement that the nature and source
of such compensation will be furnished upon written request of the customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In crafting the proposed amendments, the Commission is mindful of the concern that requiring quantification of monetary
but not non-monetary payment for order flow could result in broker-dealers moving toward potentially undisclosed
compensatory practices, such as non-monetary payment for order flow.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, it has sought to require disclosure of non-monetary payment for order flow similar to the disclosure requirements
established for monetary payment for order flow. This is intended to provide customers with equivalent information
to evaluate a broker-dealer's order routing arrangements, and to remove any regulatory disparity between monetary
and non-monetary payments.

The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendments would accomplish these goals, and
whether there are other ways to accomplish these goals. The Commission specifically requests comment on the ability
of broker-dealers to determine whether a non-monetary payment is in return for order flow, and their ability to estimate
the value of the various forms of non-monetary payments.

Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3, as adopted, requires broker-dealers who receive payment for order flow to disclose their policies
for determining where to route orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from
customers. That Rule would not expressly require broker-dealers to provide information about their order routing
policies if instead of receiving payment for order flow in return for routing orders, they simply executed the orders
for their own account.

In recent years, multi-service broker-dealers, clearing firms, and others have acquired interests in specialist
units, particularly on regional exchanges, although several specialists on the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')
and American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') are affiliated with upstairs firms. These firms then route small customer
orders for execution to their affiliated specialist.

The Amex stated that internalization impedes price discovery and makes best execution less likely, and because internalized
order flow provides the executing market maker with a dealer spread on every internalized trade, there is little incentive
for the dealer to narrow the quoted spread.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 to require broker-dealers who choose to internalize or route
orders to affiliated organizations to provide information about this policy parallel to the information that Rule
11Ac1&hyph;3 requires them to provide concerning the routing of orders in return for payment for order flow. As defined
in proposed Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(12), internalized/affiliate order routing practices shall mean the execution
of an order by a broker-dealer as principal, or the routing of an order by the broker-dealer to an affiliated broker-dealer
or exchange member. Specifically, the amendment to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) would require firms to disclose their
policies for determining where to route customers' orders, absent specific instructions from customers, including
whether orders are executed as principal, orders are routed to an affiliated broker-dealer, or to an unaffiliated
broker-dealer or market center, including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior
to the NBBO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also is proposing to extend the confirmation and account statement valuation requirements to internalized/affiliate
order flow practices. The Commission requests comment on this aspect of the proposed rule and the ability of broker-dealers
to estimate the value of internalized/affiliate order flow. The Commission realizes that, as in the case of non-monetary
payment for order flow, precision in this area may not be possible. Therefore, the Commission seeks the views of commenters
as to whether the value of internalized order flow may be reasonably approximated by reference to the monetary amount
per share that a broker-dealer could have received for such order flow from a competing market center, or by other methods,
such as by measuring the difference between the spread received by a broker-dealer engaging in internalized/affiliate
practices and the amount that the broker-dealer could have received for the order flow from another market center.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is concerned that to the extent that the value of monetary and non-monetary payment for order flow are
quantified but the value of orders subject to internalized/affiliate practices are not, broker-dealers may be encouraged
to engage in the latter practices to a greater degree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission invites commenters to address whether the proposed amendment would provide customers with meaningful
information and would further the goals of section 11A of the Act. To the extent that they believe payment for order
flow and internalized/affiliate practices should be treated differently for regulatory purposes, commenters
are requested to indicate why concerns with respect to internalization are less compelling than those frequently
associated with payment for order flow practices. Similarly, the Commission recognizes that the unequal regulatory
treatment of internalized order flow may result in an increase in the amount of customer orders that are executed directly
by a broker-dealer or its affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

C. Order Routing Disclosure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) would require all broker-dealers to disclose their policies for determining
where to route customer orders absent specific instructions from the customer, as well as a description of the extent
to which orders may receive price improvement. If adopted, this disclosure currently required under Rule 11Ac1&hyph;2
would be required for all orders, regardless of whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow or engaged
in internalized/affiliate order routing practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the proposed disclosure of order routing practices is consistent with its goal of providing
customers with information to enhance their ability to evaluate the quality of execution received, and to make informed
decisions with respect to the selection of broker-dealers. Under Rule 10b&hyph;10 of the Act, the Commission currently
requires broker-dealers to disclose their capacity as agent or principal with respect to customer transactions,
the agency commission received in connection with a particular transaction, and the source and amount of any additional
remuneration to be received in connection with a transaction, among other matters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a result of these disclosures, investors have a better understanding of commissions and other costs associated
with the execution of a transaction. The Commission believes that proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) will further
facilitate the ability of investors to understand order routing possibilities and the decisions made by broker-dealers
in this regard. The Commission believes that such information would be of significant benefit to investors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, a broker-dealer's decision regarding the routing of orders involving securities listed for trading
on national securities exchanges raises the issue of price improvement. Orders in such securities that are routed
to certain exchange facilities typically will receive an opportunity for price improvement,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 while similar orders routed to other market centers_and, currently, generally with respect to all non-listed securities_may
forgo this possibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to enhancing the ability of customers to evaluate the costs and benefits of a broker-dealer's order routing
determinations, the Commission believes that the proposed amendment to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3(a)(2) will help obviate
some of the difficulty in identifying those practices that involve conflicts between the interests of broker-dealers
and their customers. In light of the complexity and the perceived economic similarity between payment for order flow
and other market practices designed to induce or influence order flow, or that present the same concerns_such as internalization
practices_the Commission believes that the requirement that all broker-dealers disclose their order routing practices
will help facilitate equal regulation, reduce investor confusion, and further empower investors to make informed
decisions in their own best interests. Broker-dealers making disclosure under the proposed rule are encouraged
to explain how their order routing determinations are in the overall best interests of their customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission also solicits the views of commenters regarding whether the disclosure of broker and dealer
order routing policies should be set forth in a standardized format on the confirmation involving, for example, general
categories of order routing practices such as internalized/affiliate order flow, order flow subject to payment
for order flow, and order flow routed to unaffiliated market centers, thereby facilitating customer understanding
and ease of comprehension.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 does not apply to exchange-traded options. Although the October 1993 Proposing Release did not
request comment on whether payment for order flow disclosures should be extended to these securities, two exchanges

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In light of the favorable, albeit limited comments, the Commission proposes to amend Rules 11Ac1&hyph;3 and 10b&hyph;10
to include standardized options. The Commission particularly invites comment on whether the disclosure requirements
would result in unique problems for firms effecting transactions in options.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission invites comment on all the issues raised in this release including expanding the definition of payment
for order flow, the proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10, the amendments to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 regarding disclosure
of the value of payment for order flow and internalization/affiliate practices, inclusion of standardized options,
and other approaches that address internalization/affiliate practices and payment for order flow, including a
requirement that broker-dealers describe their order routing practices for all orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also requests commenters to address the feasibility of adopting the proposed amendments to become
effective on April 3, 1995, the date newly adopted Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 are to take
effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the specific requests for comment set forth above, the Commission requests comment on whether the proposed
rule amendments, if adopted, would have an adverse effect on competition or would impose a burden on competition that
is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the Exchange Act. Comments on the inquiry will
be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilities under Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act.

IV. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. sec.
603 regarding the proposed rules. The following summarizes the conclusions of the IRFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IRFA uses certain definitions of ``small entities'' adopted by the Commission for purposes of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. The Analysis notes that the proposed rule amendments would require at the time an account is opened
and on an annual basis thereafter, broker-dealers to disclose their policies for routing customer orders in exchange
listed securities, provide the range of monetary payment for order flow received on a per share basis on the confirmation,
the aggregate value of monetary payment for order flow, an estimate of the aggregate value of non-monetary payment
for order flow and internalized/affiliate orders, and an estimate of the range of non-monetary payment for order
flow and internalized/affiliate orders received by the broker-dealer on a per share basis on the confirmation. The
proposals could necessitate changes to broker-dealer confirmation systems that generally do not provide that specific
information now. Broker-dealers would need to keep records of payment for order flow to fulfill the disclosure requirements
of the proposed rule amendments. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained by contacting
Jill W. Ostergaard, Attorney, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange
Commission, Washington, DC 20549, 202/942&hyph;3197.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 1, 1994, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 38956) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping finding on cadmium from Japan (August 4, 1972). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
this antidumping finding on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under &sect;353.2 (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping finding on cadmium from Japan
is no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking this antidumping finding in accordance
with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the revocation are shipments of cadmium from Japan. This merchandise is currently classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 8107.10.00. The HTS number is provided for convenience and customs
purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department may revoke an antidumping finding if the Secretary concludes that the finding is no longer of any interest
to domestic interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in an antidumping finding when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to revocation (19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 1, 1994, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 38956) its notice of intent to revoke the antidumping findings on titanium sponge from Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan (August 28, 1968).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served written notice of its intent to revoke
these antidumping findings on each domestic interested party on the service list. Domestic interested parties who
might object to the revocation were provided the opportunity to submit their comments not later than the last day of
the anniversary month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no requests for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party, as defined under &sect;353.2 (k)(3), (k)(4), (k)(5), or (k)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Based on these facts, we have concluded that the antidumping findings on titanium sponge
from Estonia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan are no longer of any interest to interested parties. Accordingly, we are revoking these antidumping
findings in accordance with 19 CFR 353.25(d)(4)(iii).

 (59 FR 34410) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on leather wearing apparel from Uruguay (47 FR 31032;
July 17, 1982). Additionally, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(ii), the Department served certified written notice
of its intent to revoke this countervailing duty order on each party listed on its most current service list. Domestic
interested parties who might object to the revocation were provided 30 days to submit their comments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by this order are shipments of Uruguayan leather wearing apparel and parts and pieces thereof. This
product is currently classified under item numbers 4203.10.4030, 4203.10.4060, 4203.10.4085, and 4203.10.4095

Determination To Revoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department may revoke a countervailing duty order if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that the order is no longer
of interest to interested parties. We conclude that there is no interest in a countervailing duty order when no interested
party has requested an administrative review for at least five consecutive review periods and when no domestic interested
party objects to the revocation (19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we received no request for review for five consecutive review periods. Furthermore, no domestic interested
party as defined under &sect;355.2 (i)(3), (i)(4), (i)(5), or (i)(6) of the Department's regulations, has expressed
opposition to revocation. Therefore, we have concluded that the countervailing duty order covering leather wearing
apparel from Uruguay is no longer of interest to interested parties, and we are revoking this countervailing duty
order in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This revocation applies to all shipments of leather wearing apparel from Uruguay exported on or after January 1, 1993.
Shipments of this merchandise exported during the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993, will be subject
to automatic assessment in accordance with 19 CFR 355.22(g)(1). Further, as required by 19 CFR 355.25(d)(5), the
Department is terminating the suspension of liquidation on the subject merchandise as of the effective date of this
notice and will instruct the Customs Service to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, all unliquidated
entries of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1994.

SUMMARY:

 On January 1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the international harmonized system of tariff classification.
On January 11, 1989, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the Conversion to Use of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of Classifications for Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings (54 FR 993; January 11,
1989) (1989 Conversion) for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress
as of January 1, 1989. The Department now proposes to amend the 1989 Conversion governing the countervailing duty
order on certain textile mill products from Argentina. Interested parties are invited to comment on this proposed
amended conversion.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1985, the Department issued a countervailing duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina (C&hyph;357&hyph;404)
(50 FR 9846; March 12, 1985). The scope of this order was originally defined solely in terms of the Tariff Schedules
of the United States Annotated (TSUSA) item numbers; no narrative product description was provided. On January 1,
1989, the United States fully converted from the TSUSA to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Section 1211 of the
Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 directed the Department to ``take whatever actions are necessary to
conform, to the fullest extent practicable, with the tariff classification system of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
[for] all *&blank;*&blank;* orders *&blank;*&blank;*'' in effect at the time of the implementation of the HTS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on January 11, 1989, after reviewing comments received from the public, the Department published the
1989 Conversion for all antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect or investigations in progress as of
January 1, 1989 (54 FR 993). The notice also included the conversion of the scope of the referenced textile mill product
order from TSUSA to HTS item numbers. The 1989 Conversion was based on a one-to-one correspondence of the TSUSA and
HTS item numbers. In the notice, the Department stated that the conversion could be amended, as warranted, at any time
during the applicable proceeding as a result of the submission of comments or new factual information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of comments submitted to the Department by the importing public and advice received from the U.S. Customs
Service, the Department determined that the 1989 Conversion did not accurately reflect the scope of the countervailing
duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina and, therefore, that the conversion should be amended.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To rectify the problems in the 1989 Conversion, the Department, with the assistance of the U.S. Customs Service and
the U.S. International Trade Commission, has once again compared the TSUSA-defined scope and the HTS-defined scope
provided by the 1989 Conversion, and identified those HTS numbers that more reasonably correspond with the TSUSA-defined
scope of the countervailing duty order on Certain Textile Mill Products from Argentina. A new proposed amended conversion
is found in the attached appendix.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (12 months)
from April 1, 1995 to March 31, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15% $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 9, 1994, NMFS published a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice announcing the availability of draft stock assessment reports and PBR workshop reports (59 FR 40527). The
stock assessment reports are required under the new section 117 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of
1994 (Public Law 103&hyph;238). A summary of the stock assessment reports, specifying geographical range, regional
designation, minimum abundance estimate, PBR, and estimated human-caused mortality for each stock, was followed
by a designation of strategic or nonstrategic. The PBR workshop, consisting of NMFS and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
scientists, was convened to develop an initial approach for promoting consistent national interpretation of parameters
to be used in draft stock assessment reports, including the calculation of PBR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial comment period for NMFS draft stock assessment and PBR workshop reports was scheduled to end on November
7, 1994. In response to concern that the public comment period was inadequate, given the scope of the issues surrounding
the assessments and the workshop reports, NMFS extends the comment period and welcomes comments received by December
1, 1994. Comments must be received in the Office of Protected Resources by December 1 to be fully considered. Therefore,
those submitting comments close to that date should fax their comments or call to ensure their comments arrived via
mail.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy and Department of Army announce their
intention to conduct a scoping meeting for the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the
proposed relocation of Navy reservists from the Naval Reserve Readiness Center at Lake Union and the replacement
of the Army Reserve training facilities currently located in the 500 Area at Fort Lawton.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice augments the Notice of Intent to prepare a DEIS for this proposed action that was published in the October
12, 1994

.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chief of Naval Reserve and U.S. Army Reserve Command's preferred alternative is to construct and operate a 120,000
square foot Joint Use Reserve Center in the southwest corner of Fort Lawton, near the existing 124th Army Reserve Command
Headquarters. The DEIS will consider other sites on Fort Lawton, as well as other Federally-owned sites in the Seattle
area. The DEIS will also evaluate taking no action, and constructing separate as well as joint facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A public scoping meeting has been scheduled to solicit comments about the issues that need to be addressed in the DEIS.
The meeting will be held at 7:00 PM on November 17, 1994 at the Blaine Elementary School auditorium, 2550 34th Ave. West,
Seattle, WA. A brief presentation identifying the proposed action and the EIS process will precede a request for public
comments. It is important that federal, state, and local agencies, and interested individuals take the opportunity
to identify environmental concerns that should be addressed in the DEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies and the public are also invited and encouraged to provide written comments on the scoping issues in addition
to, or in lieu of, oral comments at the coping meeting. Each speaker will be limited to five minutes at the meeting. Written
comments must be received by December 15, 1994. Comments should be sent to Engineering Field Activity Northwest,
Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Attn: Mr. Don Morris, Code 232DM, 3505 NW Anderson Hill Road, Silver Dale,
WA 98383&hyph;7929. Questions concerning this notice should be directed to Mr. Morris at (206) 396&hyph;5976.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on October 17, 1994, The Wisconsin Public Power Incorporated System (WPPI) tendered for filing an
application requesting that the Commission order Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO), Wisconsin Power and
Light Company (WP&amp;L), and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) jointly, joint network tariff to provide
network transmission services on a joint, single-system basis to WPPI. The application was filed pursuant to Section
211 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by Energy Policy Act of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 824j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its application, WPPI requests that network service be provided commencing on May 1, 1995, and continuing on a long-term
basis thereafter. The total transmission capacity requested would be sufficient for WPPI to integrate its load in
eastern Wisconsin (now approximately 482 MW) with WPPI's resources. The service requested is network service over
the integrated transmission grid of the EWU. The service requested includes both long and short-term firm and non-firm
use, comparable in all respects to the EWU's use of the EWU grid. WPPI seeks services that will allow it, subject to existing
power purchase contracts, (i) to schedule power and energy from a variety of sources within and outside of the EWU grid
to WPPI's loads within the control areas of WP&amp;L, WEPCO and WPS on an economic dispatch basis and in response to
planned and unplanned outages and (ii) to engage in coordination purchases and sales using the EWU grid in the same
manner as the owners of that grid schedule their power and energy transactions. The service would be costed on single-system
basis for the EWU, with one joint rate for use of the integrated transmission system of three utilities. Revenues would
be shared by the EWU. WPPI also requested that the EWU unbundle their transmission services from power sales services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the application have been served upon the affected parties, WEPCO, WP&amp;L, WPS, the Public Service Commission
of Wisconsin, and upon Madison Gas &amp; Electric Company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received applications for two new licenses for the continued operation
of the Deerfield River Project No. 2323, and the Gardners Falls Project No. 2334. The projects are located on the Deerfield
River, in Windham and Bennington Counties, Vermont, and Franklin and Berkshire Counties, Massachusetts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff has determined that licensing these projects would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the staff intends to prepare an environmental impact
statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric projects in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff's
EIS will objectively consider both site specific and cumulative environmental effects of the projects and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial and engineering analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EIS. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final licensing decisions.

Scoping Meetings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FERC staff will conduct three scoping meetings. The two evening scoping meetings, one each in Massachusetts and Vermont,
are primarily for public input while the day-time meeting will focus on resource agency and non-governmental organization
(NGO) concerns. All interested individuals, organizations, and agencies are invited to attend and assist the staff
in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help focus discussions, a preliminary scoping document outlining subject areas to be addressed at the meeting
will be distributed by mail to interested parties on the FERC mailing list. Copies of the preliminary scoping document
will also be available at the scoping meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the scoping meetings, the staff will: (1) Summarize the environmental issues tentatively identified for analysis
in the planned EIS; (2) solicit from the meeting participants all available information, especially quantifiable
data, on the resources at issue, (3) encourage statements from experts and the public on issues that should be analyzed
in the EIS, including viewpoints in opposition to, or in support of, the staff's preliminary views, (4) determine
the relative depth of analysis for issues to be addressed in the EIS, and (5) identify resource issues that are not important
and do not require detailed analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 18, 1994 and August 29, 1994, National Power Exchange, Corp. (NPEC) submitted for filing a rate schedule
under which NPEC will engage in wholesale electric power and energy transactions as a marketer. NPEC also requested
waiver of various Commission regulations. In particular, NPEC requested that the Commission grant blanket approval
under 18 CFR Part 34 of all future issuances of securities and assumptions of liability by NPEC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 7, 1994, pursuant to delegated authority, the Director, Division of Applications, Office of Electric
Power Regulation, granted requests for blanket approval under Part 34, subject to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within thirty days of the date of the order, any person desiring to be heard or to protest the blanket approval of issuances
of securities or assumptions of liability by NPEC should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and
214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Absent a request for hearing within this period, NPEC is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or
liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided
that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the corporate purposes of the applicant, and compatible
with the public interests, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public nor private interests will be adversely
affected by continued approval of NPEC's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that the deadline for filing motions to intervene or protests, as set forth above, is November
7, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exports of electricity from the United States to a foreign country are regulated and require authorization under
section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 4, 1994, Enron filed an application with the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) of the Department of Energy (DOE)
for authorization to export electric energy to Mexico pursuant to section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. Enron owns
no generation or transmission facilities but has been certified by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
as a power marketer. Enron expects the majority of its transactions to be short-term sales of electricity for which
contracts have yet to be negotiated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the first application for export that FE has accepted from an individual entity that does not own or operate
physical facilities. The FE decision to accept an application from a power marketer, as opposed to the ``traditional''
electric power entities which own and/or operate physical facilities, is based on the marketer taking possession
of the electric energy inside the United States. This situation is distinguished from the power broker which simply
facilitates a sale of electric energy without ever taking ownership of the commodity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The electric energy Enron proposes to transmit to Mexico would be purchased from electric utilities and Federal power
marketing agencies. Enron asserts that such energy would be surplus to the requirements of the entities from which
it would be purchased. Enron would arrange for the exported energy to be wheeled from the selling entities, over existing
domestic transmission facilities, and delivered to the foreign purchaser over one or more of the following international
transmission lines: San Diego Gas and Electric Company's (SDG&amp;E) 230-kilovolt (kV), Miguel-Tijuana transmission
line (PP&hyph;68); the SDG&amp;E 69&hyph;kV line at San Ysidro (PP&hyph;49); the SDG&amp;E 230&hyph;kV, Imperial
Valley-La Rosita line (PP&hyph;79); El Paso Electric Company's 115&hyph;kV lines at Diablo, New Mexico (PP&hyph;92)
and Ascarate, Texas (PP&hyph;48-A); Central Power and Light Company's 138&hyph;kV and 69&hyph;kV transmission
lines at Brownsville, Texas (PP&hyph;94); and the 138&hyph;kV transmission lines permitted to Mexico's Comision
Federal de Electricidad at Eagle Pass (PP&hyph;50), Loredo (PP&hyph;57), and Falcon Dam (PP&hyph;57) in Texas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enron has suggested that the initial FE authorization be sufficient for all short-term exports of 90 days duration
or less, at unspecified rates of transmission, over any of the international transmission facilities identified
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exports over 90 days duration, Enron has suggested that it notify FE prior to commencing exports and that it provide
the following information: (1) The name of the purchaser(s); (2) the term of the agreement; (3) the contract transmission
route(s) and the name of the companies providing transmission wheeling services; (4) the related FERC Rate Schedule,
if applicable; and (5) the point(s) of exportation. Enron further suggests that FE publish a notice of the proposed
transaction in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, stating that the transaction would be deemed approved and allowed to commence unless, within 10 days of publication
of such notice, (1) a protest is filed, or (2) FE notifies Enron that the transaction is not approved. Subject to the
foregoing, Enron could commence exportation at the end of a 10-day comment period. In the case of either a protest or
notification of disapproval by FE, exports could not commence without specific authorization by FE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before FE takes any final action on applications to export, it first must determine that the proposed action will not
impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination
in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. For applications
from ``traditional'' electric power systems, the standard procedure is for the applicant to submit various technical
studies which demonstrate the operation of the regional electric power supply system with the applicant exporting
specified levels of power over identified international transmission lines. The applicant also is required to demonstrate
that it would have sufficient generating capacity to sustain the proposed export under the terms and conditions of
its export agreement, while still complying with any established reserve criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since marketers generally could not be seen as having any ``native load'' requirements, the latter criterion of maintaining
sufficient reserve margins appears inappropriate and unnecessary in this instance. Conversely, FE feels that the
issue of coordinated use of regional transmission (i.e., parallel path flow) becomes more critical in the case of
marketers because of the unspecified nature of the transactions, in terms of the magnitude and sources of the export,
and the export points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FE recognizes the right of the marketer to compete in the electric power arena, as well as the legitimate reliability/operating
concerns of the ``traditional'' electric power systems. Therefore, FE is proposing an alternative means for determining
the reliability impacts in the case of exports by marketers. In lieu of the technical studies (power flow, transient
stability, etc.) usually submitted in support of an export application, FE will consider accepting executed transmission
wheeling/access agreements between the marketer/applicant and the owners of the transmission systems reasonably
expected to be involved in providing transmission service to the export point. FE is considering requiring the submission
of these transmission access agreements prior to any exports (short- or long-term) occurring over any particular
export point. If an export order is granted, the applicant could ``activate'' any or all export points by submitting
appropriate transmission agreements. After submission of the agreement(s), the applicant would be permitted to
engage in short-term exports immediately, and long-term exports subject to the procedures discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FE is soliciting comments particularly on the procedures it is considering for addressing electric reliability
concerns and the authorizing of exports of longer than 90 day duration.

file a petition to intervene under 18 CFR 385.214. Section 385.214 requires that a petition to intervene must state,
to the extent known, the position taken by the petitioner and the petitioner's interest in sufficient factual detail
to demonstrate either that the petitioner has a right to participate because it is a State Commission; that it has or
represents an interest which may be directly affected by the outcome of the proceeding, including any interest as
a consumer, customer, competitor, or a security holder of a party to the proceeding; or that the petitioner's participation
is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final decision will be made on this application after a determination is made by the DOE that the proposed action will
not impair the sufficiency of electric supply within the United States or will not impede or tend to impede the coordination
in the public interest of facilities in accordance with section 202(e) of the Federal Power Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before an export authorization may be issued, the environmental impacts of the proposed DOE action (i.e., granting
the export authorization, with any conditions and limitations, or denying it) must be evaluated pursuant to the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, Public Law 92&hyph;463, EPA gives notice of a two-day meeting of the Ecosystems
Implementation Tools Committee of the National Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology (NACEPT).
NACEPT provides advice and recommendations to the Administrator of EPA on a broad range of environmental policy issues,
and this meeting is being held to discuss the Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee agenda for the coming year.
The Administrator has asked NACEPT to concentrate on ecosystem management and how long-term ecological, economic,
and social needs can be integrated to achieve a place-based approach to environmental management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee will evaluate opportunities to re-orient the Agency's use of its
existing authorities to integrate ecosystem management into its decision-making processes; identify incentives
and barriers to promoting an ecosystems orientation or place-based approach to environmental protection; and identify
opportunities for partnership-building with other federal agencies as well as co-regulators at the state, local,
tribal levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ecosystems Implementation Tools Committee and NACEPT include a representative cross-section of EPA's partners
and constituents. However, in order to gain additional insights and perspectives from all interested parties as
this Committee begins its work, time has been allotted during the meeting for oral comments from the public. Any member
of the public wishing to present oral comments on any of these issues can schedule an appointment by contacting Gwendolyn
Whitt or Debra Miller at the address and telephone numbers below. Due to time constraints, oral presentations will
be strictly held to five minutes, and slots are limited. Available time slots will be allocated on a first-come, first
serve basis to those scheduling a presentation in advance. Written comments will be accepted at any time prior to,
or at, the meeting.

The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that establishment
of the temporary tolerances will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerances have been established
on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The total amount of the active ingredient to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental
use permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Resource Seeds, Inc., must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing
on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the
records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These tolerances expire September 1, 1996. Residues not in excess of these amounts remaining in or on the raw agricultural
commodities after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during
the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerances. These
tolerances may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on
this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12866.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612),
the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing
exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the

antifoulant paints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A conditional registration may be granted under section 3(c)(7)(C) of FIFRA for a new active ingredient where certain
data are lacking because a period reasonably sufficient for generation of the data has not elapsed since the Administrator
first imposed the data requirements, on condition that such data are received by the end of the conditional registration
period and do not meet or exceed the risk criteria set forth in 40 CFR 154.7; that use of the pesticide during the conditional
registration period will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment; and that use of the pesticide
is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Specifically, the Agency has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and

and safety determinations which show that use of ~~~4,5-dichloro-2-

effect on the environment, and that use of the pesticide is in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This conditional registration has been issued even though at this time, no additional ecological effects and environmental
fate data will be required for this manufacturing use product. However, additional requirements for environmental
fate and ecological effects data are being held in reserve pending the review of leaching studies and will be requested
for this manufacturing use product. The leaching from the matrix data will be required for end-use formulators. The
data only supports the formulation of marine antifloulant paints for boats and vessels only. If these conditions
are not complied with, the registration will be subject to cancellation in accordance with FIFRA section 6(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with section 3(c)(7)(C), the Agency has determined that this conditional registration is in the public
interest. Use of the pesticides are of significance to the user community, and appropriate labeling, use directions,
and other measures have been taken to ensure that use of the pesticides will not result in unreasonable adverse effects
to man and the environment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA received an application from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., 6-9, Hiranomachi 2-Chome Chou-ku,
Osaka 541, Japan to register the pesticide product RYH-86NA (EPA File Symbol 63898&hyph;R), containing the active
ingredient 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one at 48.20 percent, an active ingredient not included in any previously
registered product. However, since the notice of receipt of application to register this product did not publish
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, as required by section 3(c)(4) of FIFRA, as amended, interested parties may submit written comments within 30 days
from the date of publication of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
~~~~
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The application was approved on August 11, 1994, as RYH-86NA for formulation into end-use products only (EPA Registration
Number 63898&hyph;1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
~~The Agency has considered all required data on risks associated with the proposed use of 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one,
and information on social, economic, and environmental benefits to be derived from use. Specifically, the Agency
has considered the nature of the chemical and its pattern of use, application methods and rates, and level and extent
of potential exposure. Based on these reviews, the Agency was able to make basic health safety determinations which
show that use of 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one when used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized
practice, will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects to the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More detailed information on this registration is contained in an EPA Pesticide Fact Sheet on 4,5 dichloro-1,2-dithiol-3-one.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of this fact sheet, which provides a summary description of the chemical, use patterns and formulations, science
findings, and the Agency's regulatory position and rationale, may be obtained from the National Technical Information
Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 3(c)(2) of FIFRA, a copy of the approved label and the list of data references used to support
registration are available for public inspection in the office of the Product Manager. The data and other scientific
information used to support registration, except for material specifically protected by section 10 of FIFRA, are
available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division
(7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 1132, CM #2, Arlington, VA 22202 (703-305&hyph;5805).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to facilitate the discharge of its responsibilities as a conservator and liquidator of insured depository
institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) publishes the following notice. The publication
of this notice is intended to comply with Title 16, Section 20 of the Oklahoma Statutes (16 O.S. 20) which, in part, declares
Federal agencies that publish notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 concerning their promulgation of powers of attorney, to be exempt from the statutory requirement of having to record
such powers of attorney in every county in which the agencies wish to effect the conveyance or release of interests
in land.

Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Purusant to Section 11 of the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDI) Act (12 U.S.C. 1821), as amended by Section 212 of the
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), the FDIC is empowered to act as conservator
or receiver of any state or federally chartered depository institution which it insures. Furthermore, under Section
11A of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1821a), as enacted under Section 215 of FIRREA, the FDIC is also appointed to manage the
FSLIC Resolution Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon appointment as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC by operation of law becomes successor in title to the assets
of the depository institutions on behalf of which it is appointed. As a Manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, the FDIC
became successor in title to both the corporate assets formerly owned by the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation (FSLIC), as well as to the assets of the depository institutions for which the FSLIC was appointed receiver
prior to January 1, 1989. In addition, pursuant to Section 13(c) of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1823(c)), the FDIC also acquires
legal title in its corporate capacity to assets acquired in furtherance of providing monetary assistance to prevent
the closing of insured depository institutions or to expedite the acquisition by assuming depository institutions
of assets and liabilities from closed depository institutions of which the FDIC is receiver.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to facilitate the conservation and liquidation of assets held by the FDIC in its aforementioned capacities,
the FDIC has provided powers of attorney to selected employees of its Southwest Service Center Office. These employees
include: Jeffrey C. Conwell, Lawrence O. Greer, John Sears, Tommy K. Sears and John Vernon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each employee to whom a power of attorney has been issued is authorized and empowered to: Sign, seal and deliver as the
act and deed of the FDIC any instrument in writing, and to do every other thing necessary and proper for the collection
and recovery of any and all monies and properties of every kind and nature whatsoever for and on behalf of the FDIC and
to give proper receipts and acquittances therefor in the name and on behalf of the FDIC; release, discharge or assign
any and all judgments, mortgages on real estate or personal property (including the release and discharge of the same
of record in the office of any Prothonotary or Register of Deeds wherever located where payments on account of the same
in redemption or otherwise may have been made by the debtor(s)), and to endorse receipt of such payment upon the records
in any appropriate public office; receipt, collect and give all proper acquittances for any other sums of money owing
to the FDIC for any acquired asset which the attorney-in-fact may sell or dispose of; execute any and all transfers
and assignments as may be necessary to assign any securities or other choses in action; sign, seal, acknowledge and
deliver any and all agreements as shall be deemed necessary or proper by the attorney-in-fact in the care and management
of acquired assets; sign, seal, acknowledge and delivery indemnity agreements and surety bonds in the name of and
on behalf of the FDIC; sign receipts for the payment of all rents and profits due or to become due on acquired assets;
execute, acknowledge and deliver deeds of real property in the name of the FDIC; extend, postpone, release and satisfy
or take such other action regarding any mortgage lien held in the name of the FDIC; execute, acknowledge and deliver
in the name of the FDIC a power or attorney wherever necessary or required by law to any attorney employed by the FDIC;
foreclosed any mortgage or other lien on either real or personal property, wherever located; do and perform every
act necessary for the use, liquidation or collection of acquired assets held in the name of the FDIC; and sign, seal,
acknowledge and deliver any and all documents as may be necessary to settle any action(s) or claim(s) asserted against
the FDIC, either in its Receivership or Corporate capacity, or as Manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) has approved a modification to its Policy Statement on
Payment System Risk regarding net debit caps. Specifically, the Board has approved that the multiple associated
with the de minimis net debit cap be doubled from 20 to 40 percent of risk-based capital. In addition, the Board approved
administrative counseling flexibility for institutions that continue to exceed their net debit caps due to the posting
of non-Fedwire transactions. Under this flexibility, the Reserve Banks will work with affected institutions on
means of avoiding daylight overdrafts, but will not subject these institutions to routine counseling for daylight
overdrafts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board has established a Payment System Risk Policy Statement pursuant to its authority under the Federal Reserve
Act. 12 U.S.C. 221 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In October 1993, the Federal Reserve implemented a set of intraday posting rules for debits and credits affecting
depository institution accounts with Reserve Banks. The posting rules provide for the posting of non-Fedwire transactions
at specific times during the day, in addition to the posting of Fedwire funds and securities transfers as they occur
throughout the day. In contrast, according to the posting rules that were in effect prior to last October, non-Fedwire
payments for each depository institution were netted and, if a net credit resulted, the amount was posted to the institution's
Federal Reserve account as of the opening of business and, if a net debit, as of the close of business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to implementation of the new posting rules, about 200 institutions, on average, exceeded their daylight overdraft
caps during any given two-week reserve maintenance period. Immediately following implementation of the new posting
rules, this number increased to between 1200 and 1500 institutions per period. In anticipation of this increase,
the Board adopted a ``transition period'' for routine administrative counseling in order to provide institutions
with a period of time to implement changes to their Federal Reserve account management procedures in order to reduce
the incidence of daylight overdrafts in excess of daylight overdraft caps. Following nearly one year of ``transition,''
about 750 to 800 institutions per period still typically exceed their caps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new posting rules were intended, in large part, to support the assessment of daylight overdraft fees, which began
on April 14, 1994. The posting rules were developed by the Board over a three-year period and included two separate
requests for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the new posting rules, four general principles were established. First, the intraday posting rules
were designed not to generate intraday float. The old posting rules typically created approximately $30 billion
in intraday float. Second, the new posting rules were to permit depository institutions to anticipate precisely
when transactions would be posted to their account. Under the old posting rules, an institution would not know until
after the close of business whether the net of all non-Fedwire activity was a credit or a debit and, accordingly, whether
the netted amount would be posted as of the opening or closing of business. Third, the posting rules were designed to
be consistent with the legal rights and responsibilities of depository institutions. Under this principle, check
debits would not be posted to an institution's account prior to presentment of the checks. Finally, the new posting
rules were intended to be competitively neutral. That is, neither the Reserve Banks nor private sector providers
of correspondent banking services should be artificially advantaged by the new posting rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these principles, the debit to an institution for any payment is posted at the same time as the credit is posted
to the account of the counterparty to the transaction. The exception to this guideline is for check transactions where,
by virtue of the nature of check processing, it is not possible to match debits and credits on a transaction-by-transaction
basis throughout the day. In addition, because checks should not be debited prior to presentment, a single time for
all check debits and credits would necessarily be later in the day than many depository institutions believed appropriate.
Therefore, debits for checks presented to depository institutions are posted on the next clock hour at least one hour
following presentment, beginning at 11:00 a.m., Eastern Time. Credits for check deposits are either posted (1) at
a single, float-weighted posting time or (2) at multiple times throughout the day, beginning at 11:00 a.m., Eastern
Time, using a set of fractions that are based upon Reserve Bank check collection experience. For check credits, depository
institutions are permitted to select either option, based upon which alternative best meets their needs. Currently,
the earliest float-weighted posting time (Option 1), which enables an institution to have full use of check deposit
credits, is 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On average over a day, these check posting rules result in a minimal amount of intraday check float. At specific points
in time during the day, however, the check posting rules appear to be giving rise to as much as $20 billion in ``credit
float,'' whereby the Reserve Banks have posted debits to depository institution accounts prior to providing corresponding
credits on check transactions to other institutions. The impact of this float, and the measured daylight overdrafts
it creates, appears to be falling primarily on smaller depository institutions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the old posting rules, smaller institutions seldom incurred significant daylight overdrafts and, thus, were
able to make use of the ``exempt from filing'' or ``de minimis'' daylight overdraft caps without incurring a significant
number of cap breaches. Under the new posting rules, however, on average over four recent reserve maintenance periods,
600 of the 775 total institutions with daylight overdrafts in excess of their caps were institutions that had ``exempt
from filing'' or ``de minimis'' daylight overdraft caps. An additional 159 institutions with a zero net debit cap
had cap breaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``exempt from filing'' cap permits an institution to incur daylight overdrafts up to the lesser of $10 million
or 20 percent of risk-based capital. The exempt cap does not require any action by the board of directors of the depository
institution or the filing of any documentation with its Reserve Bank. As additional flexibility, an exempt-from-filing
institution may incur up to two daylight overdrafts in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods before
it is in violation of the Board's payments system risk (PSR) policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In order to incur higher daylight overdrafts, an institution may file a resolution of its board of directors requesting
a de minimis cap, which permits daylight overdrafts up to 20 percent of risk-based capital. To be permitted even larger
amounts of intraday credit, up to 2.25 times risk-based capital on a single day, the institution must undertake a self-assessment
of creditworthiness, intraday funds management and control, and customer credit policies and controls to support
a higher daylight overdraft cap.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For institutions with other net debit cap categories, any daylight overdraft that exceeds the net debit cap would
be subject to administrative counseling by the Reserve Banks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An institution that regularly exceeds its cap is subject to progressively higher levels of administrative counseling
by its Reserve Bank. Under current guidelines, a depository institution that continues to exceed its daylight overdraft
cap ultimately may be assigned a zero cap and be placed on the real-time monitor. In this situation, a depository institution
will be prevented from originating Fedwire funds transfers that would cause, or increase, a daylight overdraft.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board's policy on daylight overdraft caps is intended to address intraday risk to the Federal Reserve arising
from daylight overdrafts. However, most non-Fedwire activity poses primarily interday, rather than intraday,
risk. Escalated counseling, including real-time monitoring, for non-Fedwire-caused daylight overdrafts may
be of limited usefulness in reducing these overdrafts. In addition, most of the daylight overdrafts caused by implementation
of the new posting rules would not result in the assessment of daylight overdraft charges, owing to the deductible
permitted in computing such charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current alternatives available to a depository institution to address the situation where it routinely exceeds
its daylight overdraft cap include: (1) filing for a ``self-assessment'' cap, (2) shifting funding patterns or delaying
the origination of funds transfers, (3) selecting the ``fractional'' check posting option in order to begin receiving
some check credits earlier than the single, float-weighted posting time, (4) having check debits posted to the account
of a correspondent bank, or (5) transferring payment processing business to a private correspondent bank. It should
be noted that filing for a self-assessment cap is an alternative available only to financially healthy institutions
and presents an increased administrative burden to these institutions. In addition, many of the small institutions
adversely affected by the posting rules have a limited amount of Fedwire funds transfer activity. Thus adjustments
to such Fedwire activity may have a minimal impact on such institutions' level of daylight overdrafts. Similarly,
a correspondent bank may be unable to provide funding to respondents earlier in the day without adversely affecting
its own daylight overdraft position.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board considered three alternatives to address cap breaches attributable to the changes in the intraday posting
rules for non-Fedwire activity: (1) increasing the size of the multiples associated with daylight overdraft net
debit caps, (2) adopting, on a permanent basis, counseling flexibility for daylight overdrafts caused by non-Fedwire
activity, or (3) changing the posting rules. Each of these alternatives is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Caps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board analyzed various scenarios to determine whether the level of exempt-from-filing or de minimis cap categories
could be increased without materially increasing risk to Reserve Banks. An increase in the exempt-from-filing daylight
overdraft cap category would require no action on the part of a depository institution, with a potentially substantial
percentage increase in intraday credit to be granted to that depository institution by the Federal Reserve. The Board
believes that any increase in the size of caps, without a self-assessment, should be made in the de minimis cap, which
requires the filing of a board of directors' resolution. This approach will ensure that senior bank management and
directors are aware of the potential amount of credit that may be obtained by the depository institution from the Federal
Reserve during the day.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In studying increases in cap levels, the Board was mindful of the existing structure of cap categories that require
a self-assessment. For example, an ``average'' cap permits daylight overdrafts, on average over a reserve maintenance
period, up to 75 percent of an institution's risk-based capital. In order not to diminish the relevance of an ``average''
cap, which can be obtained by an institution only after conducting a full self-assessment, the Board believes the
cap multiple for the de minimis cap should not approach 75 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At a level of 40 percent of risk-based capital, however, between 85 and 90 percent of cap breaches by institutions that
currently have exempt or de minimis caps would be eliminated, assuming certain exempt-from-filing institutions
file a board of directors' resolution adopting a de minimis cap. Diminishing reductions in cap breaches by institutions
with exempt and de minimis caps are achieved with cap levels beyond 40 percent, with an associated lessening of the
relative benefits of a self-assessed cap. Cap levels below 40 percent do not yield a sufficient reduction in cap breaches
to warrant any increase at all in the level of the de minimis cap. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that any increase in the size of net debit caps, in addition to providing capacity to cover current
cap breaches caused by the posting rules, would also increase the intraday capacity for daylight overdrafts resulting
from irrevocable Fedwire funds and book-entry securities transfers. The Board believes that, for the most part,
institutions with a de minimis net debit cap have a relatively limited amount of Fedwire activity and an increase in
daylight overdraft capacity will likely not increase significantly the risk exposure of the Reserve Banks. Moreover,
Reserve Banks have special procedures in place for dealing with risks posed by depository institutions in poor or
deteriorating financial condition. The Board has, therefore, approved an increase in the multiple associated with
the de minimis net debit cap from 20 percent to 40 percent of risk-based capital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Counseling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the Reserve Banks administratively counsel depository institutions that exceed their caps. For
cap categories other than the exempt-from-filing category, any daylight overdrafts in excess of a depository institution's
cap are subject to counseling by the Reserve Banks. For institutions with an exempt cap, however, only when an institution
incurs three or more daylight overdrafts in excess of its cap within a four-week period would it be subject to counseling.
The Board reviewed this frequency measure to determine whether an increase may be feasible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By increasing the number of permissible daylight overdrafts in excess of the exempt cap from two in two consecutive
two-week reserve maintenance periods to four in two consecutive two-week reserve maintenance periods, 79 percent
of the institutions with exempt-from-filing caps that had cap breaches would not be subject to counseling by their
Reserve Banks. A significant concern with increasing the permissible occurrences of cap breaches, however, is that
there is currently no size limitation on the size of those cap breaches. The Board also believes that increases in the
number of non-counselable daylight overdrafts effectively increases the amount of intraday credit that may be used
by an institution. Should the Federal Reserve decide to increase the amount of intraday credit to be extended to depository
institutions, the Board believes it would be preferable to identify such an increase clearly through an increase
in the size of a cap, rather than an increase in the number of permissible excess daylight overdrafts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another approach to minimize the administrative burden of counseling on both depository institutions and the Reserve
Banks is to exempt daylight overdrafts caused either by check transactions or all non-Fedwire transactions from
counseling. The Board believes, however, that separate treatment under the PSR policy of different types of payment
transactions is not desirable. For example, daylight overdrafts caused by book-entry securities transfers and
ACH transactions were initially excluded from counseling under the PSR policy. The Board decided in 1992 that all
transactions should be treated alike for daylight overdraft measurement purposes. In addition, counseling institutions
for some daylight overdrafts and not for others may lead to confusion, both within the Reserve Banks and at depository
institutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, some degree of counseling flexibility may be appropriate. As noted above, the Reserve Banks have had
in place since October 1993 a policy of administering daylight overdraft counseling on a flexible basis, depending
upon whether cap breaches were attributable to the new posting rules. Continued counseling flexibility appears
to be desirable largely in dealing with institutions that have a zero daylight overdraft net debit cap as well as relatively
small institutions that, by the nature of their business, will continue to exceed a positive net debit cap even after
appropriate adjustments have been made. These institutions may have few alternatives for eliminating non-Fedwire
daylight overdrafts. The institutions that have zero caps for reasons related to their financial condition are typically
already on the real-time monitor in reject or pend mode. In addition, in some cases, zero cap institutions are also
required by the Reserve Banks to prefund certain payments or collateralize any daylight overdrafts. Routinely counseling
such institutions for overdrafts caused by non-Fedwire transactions lessens the credibility of the daylight overdraft
counseling program and appears to do little to lessen the actual risk to Reserve Banks. The Board has approved such
administrative counseling flexibility on an on-going basis.

Posting Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Modifications to the intraday posting procedures would be another way to address the frequency of cap breaches by
small depository institutions. The Board believes any such modifications should be carefully weighed. The check
posting rules were adopted by the Board following a lengthy process involving two requests for public comment and
many discussions with the banking industry, as noted above. For example, the principle of the elimination of intraday
float for checks was specifically addressed through public comment in 1989. The new posting rules have now been in
place about one year and it is possible that institutions may still be adapting to those rules. In addition, changes
to these rules after such a short period of time may impose unanticipated costs associated with changing computer
programs on a large number of depository institutions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further changes to the check posting rules may also lead to the creation of intraday float. As an example, a scheme whereby
check credits are posted at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time and check debits continue to be posted on the clock hour at least
one hour following presentment would generate as much as $23 billion in debit float at 11:00 a.m., and an average of
$6 billion in float over the course of the day. However, even this radical a change to the posting rules would not eliminate
a significant fraction of cap breaches caused by the implementation of the new posting rules. Many non-Fedwire-caused
cap breaches would continue due to the posting of ACH debit transactions, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, and net settlement
entries from private clearing houses, as determined by the individual settlement arrangements. Many small depository
institutions may continue to encounter difficulties in funding these transactions on a timely basis during the day.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another possible change to the check posting rules would be to shift the first check debiting time from 11:00 a.m.,
Eastern Time to 11:00 a.m., Local Time. It was initially believed that such an approach might make the fractional check
crediting option more feasible for many institutions in the Central, Mountain, and Pacific time zones. Upon further
analysis, however, the Board determined that because of the later debiting times in western time zones, the corresponding
crediting times would shift later in the day as well, thereby lessening any positive benefit of the delayed check debits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final alternative is to establish a new set of posting rules for cap administration different from the posting rules
for the assessment of daylight overdraft fees. The Board does not believe such an approach would be desirable, as it
would likely lead to more, rather than less, of an administrative burden on small institutions and could create a significant
amount of confusion in the banking industry about the focus of the PSR initiative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has, therefore, not elected to make any changes to the established intraday posting procedures at this time.

Notice is hereby given under provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of the intent
to repatriate cultural items in the possession of the Cibola National Forest, USDA Forest Service, that meet the definition
of ``sacred object'' under Section 2 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The items consist of 30 essentially complete prayer sticks of aspen and willow, 5 fragments of prayer sticks, one red
flicker feather, one cornhusk, and a small amount of deteriorating organic matter. The items were reportedly gathered
in 1977 or 1978 by an anonymous collector from a cairn/shrine on Mt. Taylor, NM. The items were returned to the possession
of the USDA Forest Service in 1991 or 1992. The precise location of the cairn/shrine is not known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objects in this collection resemble the prayer sticks described and illustrated in Leslie A. White's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Acoma Indians
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Smithsonian Institution, 1932: 126&hyph;129). Representatives of the Pueblo of Acoma have inspected the items
and confirm their identification as prayer sticks. The representatives of the Pueblo of Acoma indicate that prayer
sticks are left as offerings at a cairn/shrine located on Mt. Taylor as part of their traditional religious practice.
Once left as an offering, the Acoma religion requires that such prayer sticks not be disturbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reginald T. Pasqual, governor of the Pueblo of Acoma, has claimed the prayer sticks and associated materials as sacred
objects and requested their repatriation to the Pueblo of Acoma. The Hopi Tribe and the Navajo Nation have been consulted
and both support the claim of the Pueblo of Acoma to this particular collection of prayer sticks from Mt. Taylor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the USDA Forest Service have determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C.
3001 (3)(C), that these items are specific ceremonial objects needed by the traditional religious leaders of the
Pueblo of Acoma for the practice of their traditional religion by its present day adherents. Officials of the USDA
Forest Service have further determined, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), that there is a relationship of shared group
identity which can be reasonably traced between these items and the Pueblo of Acoma. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice has been sent to officials of the Pueblo of Acoma. Representatives of any other Indian tribe which believes
itself to be culturally affiliated with these cultural items should contact Dr. Frank E. Wozniak, NAGPRA Coordinator,
Southwestern Region, USDA Forest Service, 517 Gold Avenue, SW., Albuquerque, NM 87102, telephone: (505) 842&hyph;3238,
before December 2, 1994. Repatriation of these sacred objects to the Pueblo of Acoma may begin after that date if no
additional claimants come forward.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with provisions of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act,
25 U.S.C. 3003(d), of completion of the inventory of human remains from a site near Blossvale, NY, that are presently
in the possession of the Rome Historical Society, Rome, NY. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A detailed inventory and assessment of these human remains has been made by Historical Society curatorial staff,
a contracted specialist in physical anthropology, and representatives of the Oneida Indian Nation (of New York)
and the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1958, Mr. Willard Teelin discovered the human remains along with some associated funerary objects following a
flash flood in Fish Creek near Blossvale, NY. The director of the Fort Stanwix Museum, operated by the Rome Historical
Society, identified the human remains and associated funerary objects as belonging to the Owasco culture. Mr. Teelin
donated the human remains to the Rome Historical Society and retained possession of the associated funerary objects.
Mr. Teelin's descendants are not aware of the whereabouts of the associated funerary objects. Osteological examination
by Dr. Richard G. Wilkinson, Department of Anthropology, State University of New York-Albany, revealed that two
individuals are represented by the human remains. The first individual was approximately 35&hyph;40 years old at
the time of death. The second individual was approximately 16&hyph;20 years old at the time of death. Both are Native
American males from the prehistoric period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inventory of the human remains and review of the accompanying documentation indicates that no known individuals
were identifiable. The Owasco culture is generally recognized in the archeological literature as being ancestral
to the five historically known Indian tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and
Seneca. The Blossvale, NY, area in which the human remains were discovered is well within the historical boundaries
of lands claimed as Oneida territory. The Oneida Indian Nation (of New York) considers itself to be the descendant
of Native Americans who occupied central New York since time immemorial. Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin has
declined to submit a claim for repatriation of these human remains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above mentioned information, officials of the Rome Historical Society have determined that, pursuant
to 25 U.S.C. 3001 (2), there is a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably traced between these
human remains and associated funerary objects and the Oneida Indian Nation (of New York). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice has been sent to officials of the Oneida Indian Nation (of New York) and the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin.
Representatives of any other Indian tribe which believes itself to be culturally affiliated with these human remains
should contact Jon Austin, Executive Director, Rome Historical Society, 200 Church Street, Rome, NY 13440, telephone:
(315) 336&hyph;5870, before December 2, 1994. Repatriation of these human remains to the Oneida Indian Nation (of
New York) may begin after that date if no additional claimants come forward.

John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M.; Revocation of Registration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 2, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order on Show Cause to John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M., of Port Orchard, Washington, proposing to revoke
his DEA Certificate of Registration, AM2446006, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner.
21 U.S.C. 823(f) (1992). The basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Dr. Morrison lacked authority to handle controlled
substances in the State of Washington. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was personally served on Dr. Morrison by DEA investigators on March 2, 1994. More than thirty
days have passed since the Order to Show Cause was served on Dr. Morrison. The Drug Enforcement Administration has
received no response from Dr. Morrison or anyone purporting to represent him. Therefore, pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d),
the Deputy Administrator finds that Dr. Morrison has waived his opportunity for a hearing on the issues raised by the
Order to Show Cause. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter and
enters his final order based on the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that on May 7, 1993, the State of Washington Department of Health Podiatric Medical
Board (Podiatric Board) found that Dr. Morrison had engaged in unprofessional conduct. As a result the Podiatric
Board revoked Dr. Morrison's privilege to practice podiatric medicine and surgery in the State of Washington and
revoked his privilege to prescribe controlled substances. Accordingly, Dr. Morrison is not authorized to administer,
dispense, prescribe, or otherwise handle controlled substances in the State of Washington wherein he is registered
with the DEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator has consistently held that DEA cannot maintain the registration of a practitioner who is
without State authority to handle controlled substances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration concludes that Dr. Morrison's
DEA registration must be revoked. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to the authority
vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate
of Registration, AM2446006, previously issued to John Thomas Morrison, D.P.M., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and
that any pending applications for renewal of such registration, be, and they hereby are, denied.

Pursuant to section 1008 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 958(i)), the Attorney General
shall, prior to issuing a registration under this Section to a bulk manufacturer of a controlled substance in Schedule
I or II and prior to issuing a regulation under Section 1002(a) authorizing the importation of such a substance, provide
manufacturers holding registrations for the bulk manufacture of the substance an opportunity for a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with &sect;1311.42 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), notice is hereby given
that on July 18, 1994, Radian Corporation, 8501 Mopac Blvd., P.O. Box 201088, Austin, Texas, 78720, made written request
to the Drug Enforcement Administration to be registered as an importer of Heroin (9200) a basic class of controlled
substance in Schedule I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firm plans to import a small quantity of this compound to make DEA exempt deuterated and non-deuterated drug reference
standards which will be sold to analytical and forensic laboratories for use in drug testing programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any manufacturer holding, or applying for, registration as a bulk manufacturer of this basic class of controlled
substance may file written comments on or objections to the application described above and may, at the same time,
file a written request for a hearing on such application in accordance with 21 CFR 1301.54 in such form as prescribed
by 21 CFR 1316.47.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any such comments, objections, or requests for a hearing may be addressed to the Deputy Assistant Administrator,
Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration, United States Department of Justice, Washington,
DC 20537, Attention: DEA Federal Register Representative (CCR), and must be filed no later than December 2, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedure is to be conducted simultaneously with and independent of the procedures described in 21 CFR 1311.42
(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). As noted in a previous notice at 40 FR 43745&hyph;46 (September 23, 1975), all applicants
for registration to import a basic class of any controlled substance in Schedule I or II are and will continue to be required
to demonstrate to the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
that the requirements for such registration pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 958(a), 21 U.S.C. 823(a), and 21 CFR 1311.402 (a),
(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) are satisfied.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is issuing this generic letter to notify you that it is reconsidering
its positions concerning certain security measures to protect against an internal threat at nuclear power plants.
It is expected that recipients will review the information for applicability to their facilities and consider actions,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fitness-for-duty rule (10 CFR Part 26) published on June 7, 1989, required power reactor licensees to implement
fitness-for-duty programs. The access authorization rule (10 CFR 73.56) published on April 25, 1991, required power
reactor licensees to implement access authorization programs. One objective of these regulations was to ensure
the reliability and trustworthiness of persons granted unescorted access to protected areas at power reactor facilities.
In light of these regulations, the NRC evaluated security requirements for protection against the insider threat
at nuclear power plants to verify that they remain appropriate. The staff discussed the initial results of this review
in SECY 92&hyph;272, ``Re-examination of Nuclear Power Plant Security Requirements Associated With the Internal
Threat,'' of August 4, 1992. The staff then recommended reducing or eliminating certain security requirements that
gave marginal protection against the insider threat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission reviewed SECY 92&hyph;292 and asked the staff to re-visit the subject and explore alternatives for
allowing reductions in unnecessary or marginally effective security measures. The staff discussed the results
of this re-evaluation in SECY 93&hyph;326, ``Reconsideration of Nuclear Power Plant Security Requirements Associated
with an Internal Threat,'' December 2, 1993.

In a staff requirements memorandum of February 18, 1994, the Commission endorsed staff recommendations to (1) issue
generic correspondence informing licensees of the opportunity to revise certain commitments in their security
plan and (2) proceed with rulemaking regarding specific changes to reduce or eliminate certain security requirements.
This generic letter discusses those areas in which licensees may choose to revise their plans.

(I) Vital Area Access Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC may accept the changes to vital area (VA) access control measures in security plans discussed below upon confirmation
that (1) certain other site-specific measures are in place or will be implemented to demonstrate (e.g., through contingency
drills) a capability, including a protective strategy, to protect against an external adversary after making any
of the changes and (2) measures are in place to examine hand-carried packages for explosives using equipment specifically
designed for that purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Compensatory Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Eliminate compensatory measures for failure of vital area mechanical lock hardware if the access control hardware
and alarms are operable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Extend the timeliness requirements for implementing compensatory measures for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
any
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 malfunctioning element of the vital area access control system from 10 minutes to a period similar to that which technical
specifications permit for safety equipment to be out of service while the plant is in Mode 1 until required to be in Mode
3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee could extend the time to implement compensatory measures only if either the VA door lock or alarms are
operable. The most restrictive limiting condition for the timeliness of the compensatory measure(s) would be the
most restrictive safety equipment in the vital areas accessed by the VA door needing compensatory measures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eliminate separate access authorization lists for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
each 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
vital area of the facility. As an alternative, maintain a single list of persons who have access to any vital area. This
list would have to be revised as status of persons changes in order to maintain its accuracy, especially for removing
vital area access authorization from individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Alarm Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Modify the response to vital area access control alarms (doors). Response would only be needed to vital area access
control alarms that coincide with an unresolved alarm at the protected area perimeter, a known intrusion, or a constant
alarm, such as that caused by an open door.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Locked Condition of Door 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although locking mechanisms and access control systems, including door alarms, would be retained, doors to vital
areas could be left unlocked. A licensee choosing this option would be expected to have the capability to remotely
lock the door(s) from both alarm stations, as necessary, in response to an external threat. Licensees choosing this
option would be expected to demonstrate, as part of the demonstration of their capability to protect against an external
adversary, the ability to remotely lock doors in time to delay the adversary where delay was essential in the protective
strategy. Access control systems retained on vital area doors would continue to maintain a record of personnel access
and generate alarms if the door was open without a proper access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process for licensees to revise their security plans to implement the changes to security measures in vital areas
will depend on the content of their present security plans. Since these changes would reduce slightly the effectiveness
of the security program, most changes would need to be processed in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.90.
Some of the changes may be processed by an exemption request or in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p). If appropriate,
changes in security plans should include commitments to the measures described in paragraph (I) above. To ensure
unrestricted emergency access, the NRC staff notes the advantages of (1) having the ability to remotely unlock doors
to vital areas from each alarm station, (2) ensuring that malfunctions result in doors failing unlocked rather than
locked, and (3) allowing all operators and auxiliary operators to carry metal keys that can override keycard-operated
lock mechanisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(II) Access Search of On-duty Armed Security Guards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC may accept changes to allow armed security officers who (1) are on duty and carry a weapon in accordance with assigned
duties, (2) have already been searched during their current shift, and (3) have left the protected area on official
business, to reenter the protected area without being subject to the metal detector searches (but still be subjected
to explosive searches). If search equipment is a single unit containing both metal and explosive detection equipment,
alarms from the metal detector may be disregarded. This change could be made to security plans in accordance with 10
CFR 50.54(p).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(III) Containment Access Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC may accept changes to allow persons other than security personnel, provided they are appropriately trained in
access control procedures in accordance with the security plan, to control access for personnel and materials entering
the containment any time frequent access is permitted to the containment. This change could be made to security plans
in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(IV) Alternative Measures for Control of Security Badges
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC may accept changes to allow for alternative approaches for accountability of picture badges used for unescorted
access so that certain types of badges may be taken outside the protected area. Alternative approaches need to include
the ability to ensure positive identification of individuals upon entry to the protected area and to ensure the badge
is disabled of its access function when taken out of the protected area. For employees, such changes can be made under
10 CFR 50.54(p) because the regulations currently allow licensee employees to take badges off site. Changes to security
plans to allow contractors to take security picture badges off site would require a request for exemption from the
provisions of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5). Coincident with receiving approval of the exemption request, the licensee would
be able to implement the change in accordance with 10 CFR 50.54(p).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will conduct a public workshop on December 2, 1994, to discuss the Commission's
Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Implementation Plan. The PRA Implementation Plan was developed to ensure that
the increased use of PRA methods and technology in nuclear regulatory activities would be implemented in a consistent
and predictable manner that promotes regulatory stability and efficiency. The purpose of the workshop is to inform
the public of NRC activities related to increasing the use of PRA methods and techniques in regulatory applications
and receive public comments on these activities. The principal focus of this workshop will be PRA applications for
commercial power reactors and while the NRC presentations will be broad in nature, NRC staff representatives will
be present to address specific areas of concern or specific line items in the PRA Implementation Plan.

The Proposed PRA Policy Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To establish top-level guidance on the use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities and aid in development of a detailed
PRA Implementation Plan, the NRC staff proposed a policy statement regarding the use of PRA in regulatory activities.
The policy statement would articulate the Commission's position on the role of PRA in various regulatory programs
and would communicate that position to the NRC staff, the public, licensees, and applicants for licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff discussed its recommendations for a PRA policy statement in SECY&hyph;94&hyph;218, ``Proposed Policy
Statement on the Use of Probabilistic Risk Assessment Methods in Nuclear Regulatory Activities.'' In SECY&hyph;94&hyph;218,
the staff stated that an overall policy on the use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities should be established so
that the many potential applications of PRA can be implemented in a consistent and predictable manner that promotes
regulatory stability and efficiency. In addition, the staff stated that the use of PRA technology in NRC regulatory
activities should be increased. The increased use of PRA methods and technology is intended to complement and enhance
deterministic-based regulations by using PRA technology in activities where methods and data are well understood.
The staff believes the increased use of PRA technology would lead to improved risk-effective safety decisions and
more focused and efficient use of NRC staff and industry resources.

The Commission concludes that increased use of PRA techniques as an integral part of the regulatory decision-making
process is now justified. Consequently, the Commission has proposed a policy to encourage the use of PRA and to expand
the scope of PRA applications in nuclear regulatory matters to the extent supported by the state-of-the-art methods
and data. An important aspect of the expanded use of PRA technology would be a strengthening of NRC's defense-in-depth
philosophy by helping to identify and address weaknesses or overly conservative regulatory requirements for the
physical and functional barriers. In its Staff Requirements Memorandum of October 4, 1994, the Commission directed
the staff to revise the proposed policy statement and publish the proposed policy statement for public comment. The
proposed PRA Policy Statement is scheduled to be published in the

The PRA Implementation Plan was developed in parallel with the Proposed PRA Policy Statement to ensure that the increased
use of PRA methods and technology in nuclear regulatory activities would be implemented in a consistent and predictable
manner that promotes regulatory stability and efficiency. This PRA Implementation Plan is a ``living'' document
that provides the framework for NRC management oversight of the use of PRA methods and technology in regulatory activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, PRA methods have been applied successfully in numerous nuclear regulatory activities
and have proven to be a valuable complement to deterministic engineering approaches. However, the increased use
of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities has broad implications and could result in changes in many areas associated
with our current regulatory framework. These areas, considered by the staff in developing the draft PRA Implementation
Plan, may include: Changes to regulations, guidance documents and inspection programs, a substantial shift in staff
resources including recruiting and training programs to provide the necessary PRA expertise, an increased emphasis
on continued development of PRA methods and decision-making tools, and enhanced reliability data collection. As
discussed in SECY&hyph;94&hyph;218, the expanded use of PRA in nuclear regulatory activities may raise additional
policy, technical, and legal issues that will be considered in subsequent modifications to the PRA Implementation
Plan.

Principal Issues Related to Increasing Use of Risk Assessment

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Four principal issues associated with applying risk assessment methods and techniques to regulatory applications
are highlighted in the PRA Implementation Plan. These issues included development of regulatory decision-making
criteria, collection and analysis of equipment and human performance data, development and use of consistent PRA
models and methods, and development of a systemic PRA training program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure consistent and appropriate decision-making that incorporates PRA methods and results, it is crucial that
coherent and clear criteria are applied. As part of this plan, decision criteria will be established that address
the interdependence of probabilistic risk and deterministic engineering principles. The process of developing
these criteria will involve communications among the NRC, the nuclear industry, and the public to ensure an understanding
by all parties of the role of PRA methods and results in NRC's risk management efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff uses equipment performance data in the conduct of PRAs, reliability analyses, component failure studies,
plant aging studies, identification and resolution of generic issues, preparation for inspections, and reviews
of technical specifications change requests. For these purposes, the staff uses generic data supplemented with
a limited amount of plant-specific data. The use of the generic data can be problematic because the data have not been
verified or updated and do not differentiate between plant-to-plant variations in performance or changes in performance
as reactor plants age. The ad hoc collection of plant-specific data is costly and inefficient.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of human performance data is even more problematic. One reason is the lack of established and accepted
human performance analysis methods and models upon which to base the collection of human performance data. This is
particularly important in the analysis of operator performance in response to events during which both acts of omission
and commission may occur. Human reliability methods and data are currently the focus of research and limited evaluations
of human performance issues raised by analysis of operating reactor events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the NRC and the nuclear reactor industry move toward greater use of PRA, the need for better data on human performance,
plant-specific safety system availability data (at the system train level), and equipment reliability data will
be required to continue to increase the role of PRA in the regulatory decision-making process. Increased availability
of data on equipment and human performance is very important to implementing many risk-based regulation initiatives.
For example, this information is essential for implementing the maintenance rule and in supporting the development
of risk-based technical specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff recognizes the need to collect equipment and human performance data. This information, derived largely
from operating experience, will continue to provide a source of credible performance data for NRC use in the regulatory
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC PRA Working Group identified the need for the development and use of consistent PRA models and methods. Several
tasks that are now being undertaken include the development of more user-friendly computer interfaces; the development
of low-power and shutdown models, external events models, and Level 2/3 PRA models compatible with the needs of NRC
events assessment staff; and the development of methods for consistently identifying the appropriate detailed
PRA model for use in the analysis of individual events or issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that not all of the NRC's risk management activities lend themselves to a risk analysis approach
that uses a probabilistic, fault free methodology. The NRC recognizes that a single approach to risk management is
not appropriate. As part of the PRA Implementation Plan the NRC will develop and validate risk assessment models and
methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another issue is the training of the staff who will not be directly working with PRA methods. As the NRC shifts to grater
use of, and reliance on, PRA methods and risk-based regulation, all technical staff members, including inspectors,
will need to develop an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of PRA methods and their use. The PRA Implementation
Plan includes an extensive training program. This training program is based on the systems approach to training,
which includes completing job task analyses, developing learning objectives, developing and delivering courses,
evaluating trainee mastery of objectives, and modifying the PRA training program as necessary. Because the number
of NRC staff members who will need training is large, a large resource commitment over the next several years will be
required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRA Implementation Plan will require users and developers of the new methods to have significant experience in
PRA methods and statistics. It will take time for these staff members to gain the necessary experience. Some of the
knowledge and skills needed to do this work can be obtained though traditional training. However, on-the-job training,
classroom instruction, and industrial experience will be needed in order to acquire some of the required knowledge
and experience. Recruiting of outside experts and intensified development of current staff members will likely
be necessary to gain this staff experience. This process will take several years to accomplish and will be a major factor
in the success of the PRA Implementation Plan and in establishing the pace of its implementation.

III. Workshop Content and Structure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The workshop is structured to include NRC staff presentations during the morning and to allow interested parties
to make presentations during the afternoon. An opportunity for questions and comments following presentations
is planned.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the afternoon session, participants will be allowed to express their views and make presentations. Participants
who will be making presentations will be scheduled in the order in which they notified the staff of their intention
to make a presentation. Comments will be taken from parties in the order in which they notified the staff of their intent
to comment. The order of comment will be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Parties who notified the staff by November 28, 1994;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Parties registering to comment before 8:30 a.m. the day of the workshop; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Parties who have not given prior notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations that notify the staff by November 28, 1994, of their intent to give a presentation will be limited to
20 minutes. Otherwise organization and individual presentations and comments will be limited to 5 minutes. These
time limits may be adjusted depending on the number of presentations and comments. The workshop will be transcribed,
and the transcript will be available in the NRC Public Document Room.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To foster meaningful discussions during this session and to aid participants in preparing their presentations and
comments, participants should consider the following set of questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What additional areas should be considered regarding the increased use of PRA in regulatory applications?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What areas currently in the PRA Implementation Plan require additional emphasis? What areas are emphasized
too much?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Is the overall impact of the PRA Policy Statement on regulatory activities clearly evident by the activities
in the PRA Implementation Plan?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;What impact will the PRA Policy Statement and the PRA Implementation Plan have on those organizations that
the NRC regulates?

<DOCTITLE>Regulatory Guides; Issuance, Availability</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued revisions to three guides in its Regulatory Guide Series. This series
has been developed to describe and make available to the public such information as methods acceptable to the NRC staff
for implementing specific parts of the Commission's regulations, techniques used by the staff in evaluating specific
problems or postulated accidents, and data needed by the staff in its review of applications for permits and licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.84, ``Design and Fabrication code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III,'' and
Revision 30 of Regulatory Guide 1.85, ``materials Code Case Acceptability, ASME Section III, Division 1,'' list
those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation in the licensing of light-water-cooled
nuclear power plants. Revision 11 of Regulatory Guide 1.147, ``Inservice Inspection code Case Acceptability, ASME
Section XI, Division 1,'' lists those code cases that are generally acceptable to the NRC staff for implementation
in the inserve inspection of light-water-cooled nuclear power plants. These three guides are periodically revised
to update the listings of acceptable code cases and to include the results of public comment and additional staff review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments and suggestions with items for inclusion in guides currently being developed or improvements in all published
guides are encouraged at any time. Written comments may be submitted to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division

<DOCTITLE>Florida Power and Light Company; Turkey Point Unit Nos. 3 and 4; Notice of Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating
License and Opportunity for Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has denied a portion of an amendment request by the Florida Power and
Light Company (FPL or the licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;31 and DPR&hyph;41,
issued to the licensee for operation of the Turkey Point Plant, Units 3 and 4, located in Dade County, Florida. Notice
of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14889).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specification (TS) to delete the frequencies
from the audits performed under the cognizance of the Company Nuclear Review Board (CNRB) and remove the audit of the
emergency and security plans and implementing procedures from TS. The audits would be performed at the frequency
specified in the FPL Topical Quality Assurance Report (TQAR). Some audits would be performed less frequently (biennial
rather than annual in most cases).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has concluded that the portion of the licensee's request regarding audits of the Fire Protection Program
cannot be granted for the reasons stated in letter dated October 26, 1994. The licensee was notified of the Commission's
denial of the proposed change by letter dated October 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By December 2, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the denial described above. Any person affected
by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC, 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered to the
Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date.
A copy of any petitions should also be sent to the office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Harold F. Reis, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, P.C., 1615 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20036, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendments dated February 18, 1994, as
supplemented by letter dated August 5, 1994, and (2) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated October 26, 1994.
These documents are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34711 (September 23, 1994), 59 FR 50304
(October 3, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, CBOE Rule 9.8(c) provides that background and financial information of customers who have been approved
for options transactions must be maintained at both the branch office servicing the customer's account and at the
principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over the branch office. In addition, copies of options customer
account statements over the most recent six months must be maintained at both the branch office supervising the accounts
and at the principal supervisory office with jurisdiction over that branch. The CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rule 9.8(c)
and Interpretation and Policy .03 to enable members' supervisory offices to maintain certain customer account information
at off-site locations as long as the records are readily accessible and promptly retrievable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CBOE states that the substance of CBOE Rule 9.8(c) appears uniformly in the rules of the other options exchanges
and in the options account rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). According to
the CBOE, on-site storage in major financial centers is expensive, and, in today's market environment, automated
and secure facilities for data storage and retrieval make it unnecessary to require on-site storage. The CBOE states
that, given those realities, the Options Self-Regulatory Council (``OSRC'')
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 has recommended that record retention requirements be relaxed and that the exchanges and the NASD amend their rules
to permit supervisory offices to store customer records off-premises as a matter of routine practice.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE concurs with the OSRC's recommendation and believes that its proposal will provide the CBOE's members with
the opportunity to discharge their supervisory responsibilities more efficiently and more cost-effectively.

The OSRC, which was created pursuant to a plan submitted by the options exchanges under Rule 17d&hyph;2 (``17d&hyph;2
plan'') under the Act, includes representatives from each of the registered options exchanges and the NASD. The 17d&hyph;2
plan was developed by the exchanges and approved by the Commission to reduce regulatory duplication and to coordinate
solutions to options-related sales practice issues common to firms which are members of two or more self-regulatory
organizations.

In connection with the OSRC's recommendation, the designated options examining authorities, including the CBOE,
have committed to periodic examinations of the document retention and supervisory practices of firms using off-site
storage arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts
and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements
of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to facilitate
transactions in securities, and to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, by allowing off-site storage of customer account information maintained at supervisory offices,
the Commission believes that the proposal should provide the CBOE's members with a cost-effective means to utilize
computers, facsimile machines, optical disks, and other technology to store the required customer account information
off-site while ensuring that member firms will continue to have easy access to all of the customer account information
necessary to discharge their supervisory responsibilities. In this regard, the proposal provides that options
customer account information stored off-site must be ``readily accessible and promptly retrievable,''
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 thereby preserving the Exchange's ability to access and investigate customer account records. The Commission notes
that the designated options examining authorities, including the CBOE, have agreed to make periodic examinations
of the document retention and supervisory practices of firms using off-site storage arrangements. Thus, the Commission
believes that the proposal strikes a reasonable balance between the CBOE's interest in allowing member organizations
to reduce the cost of storing customer account information and ensuring that the information continues to be available
for supervisory purposes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the CBOE to allow off-site storage of customer account
information maintained at supervisory offices, but not of account information stored at branch offices, because
branch offices are responsible for the day-to-day administration of customer accounts and require immediate access
to account information. For example, by continuing to require branch offices to store customer account information
on-site, the proposal facilitates broker compliance with the suitability requirements applicable to options customers.

II. Description of Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, the Commission approved circuit breaker proposals by the Exchanges.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In general, the Exchanges' circuit breaker rules provide that trading would halt for one hour if the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (DJIA'') were to decline 250 points from its previous day's closing level and, thereafter, trading would
halt for an additional two hours if the DJIA were to decline 400 points from its previous day's close.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 These circuit breaker mechanisms are an important part of the measures adopted by the Exchanges to address market
volatility concerns in the wake of the October 1987 Market Break.

If the 250-point trigger were reached within one hour of the scheduled close of trading for a day, or if the 400-point
trigger were reached within two hours of the scheduled close of the trading day, trading would halt for the remainder
of the day. If, however, the 250-point trigger were reached between one hour and one-half hour before the scheduled
closing, or if the 400-point trigger were reached between two hours and one hour before the scheduled closing, the
Exchanges would have the authority to use abbreviated reopening procedures either to permit trading to reopen before
the scheduled closing or to establish closing prices.

The Commission approved the Amex, Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE''),
NYSE, Phlx and National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'')
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 circuit breaker proposals on a pilot program basis. Circuit breaker proposals by the Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc. (``CBOE''),
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'')
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 and the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE'')
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 were approved by the Commission on a permanent basis rather than as a pilot program. In 1989, the Exchanges and the NASD
filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend their respective pilot programs.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993, the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx filed, and the Commission approved, proposals
to extend their respective pilot programs.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In 1993, the BSE and Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'') (formerly MSE) filed, and the Commission approved, proposals
to extend their respective pilot programs.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In 1990, 1992, and 1993, the NASD filed, and the Commission approved, proposals to extend its pilot program.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 The proposals for the Exchanges are nearing their expiration dates and the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx have filed with the
Commission proposals to extend further their respective pilot program until October 31, 1995.

The circuit breaker mechanisms were enacted in the wake of the October 1987 Market Break. Both the Report of the Presidential
Task Force on Market Mechanisms (``Brady Report'') and the Working Group's Interim Report
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 recommended that coordinated trading halts and reopening procedures be developed that would be implemented in all
U.S. markets for equity and equity related products during large, rapid market declines.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 In response, the SROs submitted proposals to implement circuit breaker procedures that are designed to substitute
planned trading halts for unplanned and destabilizing market closings. In addition, the stock index futures exchanges
have implemented parallel circuit breakers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were approved by the CFTC on a permanent basis.

The Working Group in Financial Markets was established by the President in March 1988 to provide a coordinating framework
for consideration, resolution, recommendation, and action on the complex issues raised by the market break in October
1987. The Working Group consists of the Chairmen of the Commission, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), and the Under Secretary for Finance of the Department of
the Treasury.

In particular, the Working Group recommended a one-hour trading halt if the DJIA declined 250 points from its previous
day's closing level, and a subsequent two-hour trading halt if the DJIA declined 400 points below its previous day's
closing level. The Working Group also recommended that the NYSE use reopening procedures, similar to those used on
Expiration Fridays, that are designed to enhance the information made public about market conditions.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the Exchanges' proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. Specifically, the Commission
believes the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the requirements of section 6(b)(5) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 in that they are designed to remove impediments to, and perfect the mechanism of, a free and open market, and to protect
investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission approved these proposals in October 1988, the DJIA has not experienced a one day, 250-point decline
that would trigger a market halt. Nevertheless, the Commission continues to believe that circuit breaker procedures
are desirable to deal with potential strains that may develop during periods of extreme market volatility, and, accordingly,
the Commission believes that the pilot programs should be extended. The Commission also believes that circuit breakers
represent a reasonable means to retard a rapid, one day market decline that can have a destabilizing effect on the nation's
financial markets and participants in these markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change filed by the Exchanges, including NYSE Amendment
No. 1 and Phlx Amendment No. 1, are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6 and the rules and
regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because there are no changes being made to the current provisions, which originally were subject to the full notice
and comment procedures, and accelerated approval would enable the pilots to continue on an uninterrupted basis.
Due to the importance of these circuit breakers for market confidence, soundness, and integrity, it is necessary
and appropriate that these procedures continue on an uninterrupted basis. Therefore, the Commission believes that
granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule changes is appropriate and consistent with sections 6 and 19(b)(2)
of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Solicitation of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making
written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rules changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating
to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public
in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's
Public Reference Room. Copies of such filings also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal offices
of the above-mentioned exchanges. All submissions should refer to File Nos. SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;94&hyph;40, SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;33,
or SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;44, and should be submitted by November 23, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 that the Amex, NYSE, and Phlx proposed rule changes (SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;40, SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;33
and SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;44), including NYSE Amendment No. 1 and Phlx Amendment No. 1, are approved until
October 31, 1994.

in the custody of a bank meeting the requirements of section 26(a) of the Act, a member firm of a national securities
exchange, the investment company itself, or a system for the central handling of securities established by a national
securities exchange. Section 2(a)(5) of the Act defines ``bank'' to include banking institutions organized under
the laws of the United States, member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and certain banking institutions or trust
companies doing business under the laws of any state or of the United States. Ottoman Bank does not fall within the definition
of ``bank'' as defined in the Act and, under section 17(f), may not act as custodian for registered investment companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Rule 17f&hyph;5 under the Act permits certain entities located outside the United States to serve as custodian
for investment company assets. One such entity is a banking institution or trust company that is incoroprated or organized
under the laws of a country other than the United States, that is regulated as such by the country's government or an
agency thereof, and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S.$200 million. Banque Paribas qualifies as an eligible
foreign custodian under rule 17f&hyph;5. Ottoman Bank, however, does not qualify as an eligible foreign custodian
because it does not meet the minimum shareholders' equity requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act that would exempt them from the provisions of section 17(f)
to the extent necessary for Ottoman Bank to maintain custody of Investment Company Assets. Applicants believe that
the exemption should be granted because it is necessary and appropriate in the public interest and is consistent with
the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe
that the Agreement provides Investment Companies with the safety and security of an eligible foreign custodian under
section 17(f) and rule 17f&hyph;5.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The foreign custody arrangements with Ottoman Bank will comply with the provisions of rule 17f&hyph;5 in all respects,
except those provisions relating to the minimum shareholders' equity requirement for eligible foreign custodians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Banque Paribas currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders' equity requirement
set forth in rule 17f&hyph;5(c)(2)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An Investment Company or a custodian for an Investment Company will deposit Securities with Ottoman Bank only in
accordance with a three-party contractual agreement that will remain in effect at all times during which Ottoman
Bank fails to meet the requirement of rule 17f&hyph;5 relating to minimum shareholders' equity. Each agreement will
be a three-party agreement among (a) Banque Paribas, (b) Ottoman Bank, and (c) the Investment Company or custodian
of the Securities of the Investment Company. Under the agreement, Ottoman Bank will undertake to provide specified
custodial or sub-custodial services. The agreement will further provide that Banque Paribas will be liable for any
loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by Ottoman Bank
of its responsibilities under the agreement to the same extent as if Banque Paribas had been required to provide custody
services under such agreement.

Applicants' Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Fund is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end diversified management investment
company. The Fund is composed of eleven separate portfolios. Currently, shares of the Fund are sold only to Northbrook
Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York (the ``Companies'') to fund flexible premium
variable annuity contracts issued through certain of their separate accounts. Dean Witter InterCapital Inc. (``InterCapital''),
a wholly owned subsidiary of Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co., is the investment manager for the Fund. InterCapital
and the Companies were previously under common control (ultimately owned by Sears, Roebuck and Co.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Fund intends to offer its shares to separate accounts of various insurance companies to fund variable annuity
contracts and variable life insurance contracts (collectively, ``variable contracts''). Insurance companies
whose separate accounts do or will own shares of the Fund are referred to herein as ``participating insurance companies.''
It is anticipated that participating insurance companies will rely on rules 6e&hyph;2 or 6e&hyph;3(T) under the
Act, although some may rely on individual exemptive orders as well, in connection with variable life insurance contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and
variable life insurance separate accounts is referred to as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment
company as the underlying investment medium for separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred
to as ``shared funding.'' ``Mixed and shared funding'' denotes the use of a common management company to fund a variable
annuity separate account of one insurance company and the variable annuity separate accounts of other affiliated
and unaffiliated insurance companies. Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) precludes mixed and shared funding while Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)
permits mixed funding but precludes shared funding. Applicants request an order of the Commission exempting variable
life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of such
an account) from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit mixed and shared funding.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In connection with scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered
under the Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides partial exemption from sections 9(a), 13(a),
15(a) and 15(b) of the Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account (and any investment adviser, principal underwriter
and depositor thereof) by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15), however, are not available with respect to a scheduled premium
variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an investment company that also offers its shares to
a variable annuity separate account of the same or of any affiliated or unaffiliated insurance company (``mixed funding'').
In addition, the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not available if shares of the underlying investment
company are offered to variable annuity or variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance
companies (``shared funding''). Accordingly, Applicants seek an order exempting scheduled premium variable life
insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any investment adviser, principal underwriter and depositor
of such an account) from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) thereunder, to
the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold in connection with both mixed funding and shared
funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered
under the Act as a unit investment trust, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(6)(15) provides partial exemptions from sections 9(a),
13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account (and to any investment adviser, principal
underwriter and depositor thereof) by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) permit mixed funding of flexible premium variable
life insurance but preclude shared funding. Accordingly, Applicants seek an order exempting flexible premium variable
life insurance separate accounts (and, to the extent necessary, any investment adviser, principal underwriter
and depositor of such an account from sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the Act, and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Fund to be offered and sold to separate accounts in connection
with shared funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 9(a) provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter
of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification
enumerated in sections 9(a) (1) or (2). Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) (i) and (ii), and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii),
provide exemptions from section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on mixed and shared
funding. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies
that directly participate in the management or administration of the underlying management company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The application states that the partial relief granted in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) from
the requirements of section 9 of the Act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section
9 of that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section 9. The Applicants state that those Rules
recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act to apply the provisions of section 9(a) to individuals in a large insurance company complex,
most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in (or invested in by) that organization.
Applicants state that it is also unnecessary to apply section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated insurance
companies (or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies) that may utilize the Fund as the funding
medium for variable contracts. Applicants argue that applying the requirements of section 9(a) because of investment
by other insurers' separate accounts would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. The application
states that the participating insurers are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the
Fund and that those individuals who participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same
regardless of which separate accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. Furthermore, the increased monitoring
costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners.

5. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(iii) assume the existence of a pass-through voting requirement
with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. Applicants state that pass-through
privileges will be provided with respect to all variable contract owners so long as the Commission interprets the
Act to require pass-through voting privileges for variable contract owners. However, Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)
and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide exemptions from the pass-through voting requirement with respect to several
significant matters, assuming the limitations on mixed and shared funding are observed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) provide that the insurance company may disregard
the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract
between a fund and its investment adviser, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority. Voting instructions
may also be disregarded by the insurance company if the contract owners initiate any change in the investment company's
investment policies, principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions
is reasonable and based on a specific good faith determination as required under the Rules. Applicants assert that
the rights of an insurance company or of a state insurance regulator to disregard contract owners' voting instructions
are not inconsistent with mixed or shared funding. According to the Applicants, there is no reason why the investment
policies of any portfolio of the Fund would or should be materially different from what it would or should be if it funded
only annuity contracts or only scheduled or flexible premium life contracts and that there is no reason to believe
that different features of various types of contracts will lead to different investment policies for different types
of variable contracts. Applicants represent that the Fund will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular
insurer or type of insurance product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Application states that mixed and shared funding should provide several benefits to variable contract holders.
It would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment, thereby promoting economies of scale, permitting
a greater diversification, and making the addition of new portfolios more feasible. The Applicants believe that
making the Fund available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer variable
contracts, and this should result in increased competition with respect to both variable contract design and pricing,
which can be expected to result in more product variation and lower charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Separate accounts
organized as unit investment trusts have historically been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have
not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. The Fund does not believe that mixed and
shared funding will have any adverse federal income tax consequences.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the requested order is granted, Applicants consent to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A majority of the board of trustees of the Fund (the ``Board'') shall consist of persons who are not ``interested
persons'' of the Fund, as defined by section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, and as modified by any
applicable orders of the Commission, except that if this condition is not met by reason of the death, disqualification,
or bona-fide resignation of any trustee or trustees, then the operation of this condition shall be suspended: (a)
for a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period of 60 days if a vote of shareholders
is required to fill a vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the Commission may prescribe by order upon
Application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Board will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of the life owners and annuity owners and any future owners in the Fund. An irreconcilable material conflict may arise
for a variety of reasons, including: (1) An action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (2) a change in applicable
federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action
or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (3) an
administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (4) the manner in which the investments of any portfolio
are being managed; (5) a difference in voting instructions given by variable annuity contract owners and variable
life insurance contract owners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Participating insurance companies and InterCapital will report any potential or existing conflicts to the Board.
Participating insurance companies and InterCapital will be responsible for assisting the Board in carrying out
its responsibilities under these conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for
the Board to consider any issues raised. This includes, but is not limited to, an obligation by each participating
insurance company to inform the Board whenever contract owner voting instructions are disregarded. The responsibility
to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual obligation of all insurers investing
in the Fund under their agreements governing participation in the Fund and these responsibilities will be carried
out with the view only to interests of the contract owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or a majority of its disinterested Trustee, that a material irreconcilable
conflict exists, the relevant insurance companies shall, at their expense and to the extent reasonably practicable
(as determined by a majority of the disinterested trustees), take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate
the irreconcilable material conflict, up to and including: (1) Withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of
the separate accounts from the Fund or any portfolio and reinvesting such assets in a different investment medium,
including another portfolio of the Fund, or submitting the question whether such segregation should be implemented
to a vote of all affected contract owners and as appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (i.e.,
annuity contract owners, life insurance contract owners, or variable contract owners of one or more participating
insurance companies) that votes in favor of such segregation, or offering to the affected contract owners the option
of making such a change; and (2) establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate
account. If a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of an insurer's decision to disregard contract owner
voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote, the insurer
may be required, at the Fund's election, to withdraw its separate account's investment in the fund and no charge or
penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal. The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a
Board determination of an irreconcilable material conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a
contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their agreements governing participation
in the Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this condition 4, a majority of the disinterested members of the Board shall determine whether or not
any proposed action adequately remedies any irreconcilable material conflicts, but in no event will the Fund or InterCapital
be required to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract. No participating insurance company shall
be required by this condition 4 to establish a new funding medium for any variable contract if an offer to do so has been
declined by vote of a majority of contract owners materially adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Board's determination of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall
be made known promptly to all participating insurance companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Participating insurance companies will pass through voting privileges to all variable contract owners so long
as the Commission continues to interpret the Act as requiring pass-through voting privileges for variable contract
owners. Accordingly, participating insurance companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their separate accounts
in a manner consistent with timely voting instructions received from contract owners. Each participating insurance
company will vote shares of the Fund held in its separate accounts for which no timely voting instructions from contract
holders are received, as well as shares it owns, in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions
are received. Participating insurance companies shall be responsible for assuring that each of their separate accounts
participating in the Fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other participating insurance
companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other separate accounts
investing in the Fund shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their agreements
governing participation in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Fund will comply with all provisions of the Act requiring voting by Shareholders, and in particular the Fund
will either provide for annual meetings (except insofar as the Commission may interpret Section 16 not to require
such meetings), or comply with section 16(c) of the Act (although the Fund is not one of the trusts described in the section
16(c) of the Act) as well as with section 16(a) and, if and when applicable, 16(b). Further, the Fund will act in accordance
with the Commission's interpretation of the requirements of section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of
trustees and with whatever rules the Commission may promulgate with respect thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that (1) the Fund is intended to be a funding vehicle for all types of variable
annuity and variable life insurance contracts offered by various insurance companies, (2) material irreconcilable
conflicts may possibly arise, and (3) the Board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material
irreconcilable conflicts and determine what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflict. The Fund
will notify all participating insurance companies that separate account prospectus disclosure regarding potential
risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If and to the extent that Rule 6e&hyph;2 and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) are amended, or Rule 6e&hyph;3 is adopted, to provide
exemptive relief from any provision of the Act or the rules promulgated thereunder with respect to mixed or shared
funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested in this application,
then the Fund and/or participating insurance companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as may be necessary
to comply with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T), or Rule 6e&hyph;3, as such rules are applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The participating insurance companies shall at least annually submit to the Board such reports, materials or
data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Board or the Fund may fully carry out the obligations imposed upon
them by the conditions contained in the application and said reports, materials and data shall be submitted more frequently
if deemed appropriate by the Board. The obligation of the participating insurance companies to provide these reports,
materials and data to the Board when it so reasonably requests, shall be a contractual obligation of all participating
insurance companies under their agreements governing participation in the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. All reports received by the Board of potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to determining
the existence of a conflict, notifying participating insurance companies of a conflict, and determining whether
any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board or other
appropriate records, and such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.

Applicant's Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trusts are registered under the Act as unit investment trust, and their units of interest are registered under
the Securities Act of 1933. Bear Stearns, one of the cosponsors of the Equity Securities Trust, sponsors the Trusts
and numerous other unit investment trusts. Gruntal, also a cosponsor of the Equity Securities Trust, sponsors various
other unit investment trusts with Bear Stearns (Bear Stearns and Gruntal are collectively referred to as the ``Sponsors'').
Each Trust is organized under a Trust Indenture and Agreement between the Trust, the Sponsors, and United States Trust
Company of New York or Bank of New York, as trustee, which varies from Trust to Trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On August 28, 1991, the SEC issued an order (the ``Prior Order'')
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 permitting unitholders of the Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, to exchange their units for units in another
available Trust or Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, upon payment of a reduced sales charge. The Prior order
also permits a conversion offer in which the unitholders of any registered unit investment trust for which there is
no active secondary market may redeem their units with their respective trustees and apply the proceeds to the purchase
of units of one or more of the Trusts, except the Equity Securities Trust, upon payment of the same reduced sales charge.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Equity Securities Trust is a newly formed unit investment trust consisting of a portfolio of common stock, convertible
securities, American Depository Receipts, and contracts and funds for the purchase of such securities. The Equity
Securities Trust deposits its securities with the trustee, in exchange for certificates representing undivided
interests or units in the principal and net income of the Equity Securities Trust in the ratio of one hundred units for
the indicated initial aggregate value of securities of the Equity Securities Trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. During the initial public offering period, units of the Trust are sold at a sales charge ranging from 3.5% to 5.5%,
depending on the Trust, subject to certain specified volume discounts for purchases exceeding a certain number of
units.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Sponsors, although not obligated to do so, maintain a secondary market for the units of all the existing Trusts
after the initial public offering has been completed. The Sponsors also intend to maintain a secondary market for
any new Trusts after the initial public offering has been completed. The secondary market repurchase and reoffer
price, both during and after the initial public offering period, will be based on the bid prices of the Trust's portfolio
securities. Any units repurchased by the Sponsors in the secondary market may be redeemed by the Sponsors if the Sponsors
deem such redemption to be in their best interest. If a market for the units is not maintained, unitholders will be able
to redeem their units with the trustee at a price based on the aggregate bid side evaluation of the Trust's portfolio
securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants propose to offer unitholders of the Trusts the ability to exchange any or all of their units for units
in one or more available series of the Trusts at a reduced sales charge (the ``Exchange Privilege''). Pursuant to the
Exchange Privilege, the Sponsors' repurchase price during the initial offering period of the units being surrendered
will be based on the aggregate offer price of the Trust's portfolio securities, and, if the initial offering period
has been completed, will be based on the aggregate bid price of the Trust's portfolio securities. Units in a Trust then
will be sold to the unitholder at a price based on the aggregate offer price of the securities in the Trust portfolio
during the initial public offering period of the Trust (or based on the aggregate bid price of the securities in the
Trust portfolio if the initial public offering period has been completed) plus accrued interest and a reduced sales
charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Sponsors reserve the right to suspend, modify, or terminate the Exchange Privilege. The Sponsors will provide
unitholders with 60 days prior written notice of any termination or material amended to the Exchange Privilege, except
as provided in condition 3 below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants also propose to offer a conversion offer (the ``Conversion Offer'') to all unitholders of any registered
unit investment trust in which there is no active secondary market (a ``Redemption Trust''). Pursuant to the Conversion
Offer, unitholders may elect to redeem units of a Redemption Trust at the redemption drive determined as set forth
in the relevant Redemption Trust's prospectus and apply the proceeds of the redemption to the purchase of available
units of one or more series of the Trust. The purchase price for units of a series of a Trust will be based on the aggregate
offer of the Trust's portfolio securities during its initial offering period, or at a price based on the aggregate
bid price of the Trust's portfolio securities if the initial public offering period of the Trust has been completed,
and will include accrued interest and a reduced sales charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Sponsors reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Conversion Offer at any time without prior notice
to unitholders of a Redemption Trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Exchange Privilege and Conversion Offer are substantially similar in all respects to the exchange privilege
and conversion offer already approved by the SEC in the Prior Order, except the Equity Securities Trust, as a newly
formed Trust, was not in existence at the time that order was issued. The requested relief is necessary to enable the
Equity Securities Trust to offer the same exchange privilege to its unitholders as is already permitted to unitholders
of the other Trusts pursuant to the Prior Order, and to revise the reduced sales charge under the Exchange Privilege
and Conversion Offer to be an amount equal to a percentage of the public offering price for each unit (or per 1,000 units
for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for Equity Securities Trust). The requested relief will supersede
the Prior Order in its entirety.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 11(a) of the Act requires SEC approval of an offer to exchange securities between open-end investment companies
of the exchange occurs on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the Securities to be exchanged. Section
11(c) of the Act makes section 11(a) applicable to any type of exchange offer of securities of registered unit investment
trusts for the securities of any other investment company, irrespective of the basis of exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the Exchange Privilege provides investors with a convenient means of transferring their
interests at a reduced sales charge, as their individual investment objectives change, into series of the Trust that
are better suited to meet these changing investment objectives. Applicants also state that the Conversion Offer
provides investors with a means by which unitholders of a unit investment trust in which there is no active secondary
market can redeem those units and invest the proceeds therefrom, at a reduced sales charge, into units of the trusts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Participants in the Exchange Privilege and Conversion Offer for the Trusts will, in the purchase and sale of units
of the Trusts, be subject to the same portfolio pricing terms as are set forth in the prospectus for each Trust and will
purchase and sell units of the Trusts based on the same portfolio pricing terms as all other investors who purchase
and sell units of the Trusts through the Sponsors or the underwriters in regular transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The prospectus for each Trust and any sales literature or advertisement that mentions the existence of the Exchange
Privilege will disclose that the Exchange Privilege is subject to termination and that its terms are subject to change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Whenever the Exchange Privilege is to be terminated or its terms are to be amended materially, any holder of a security
subject to that privilege will be given prominent notice of the impending termination or amendment at last 60 days
prior to the date of termination or the effective date of the amendment, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) No such notice need be given if the only material effect of an amendment is to reduce or eliminate the sales charge
payable at the time of an exchange, to add one or more new series eligible for the Exchange Privilege, or to delete a series
which has terminated, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) No notice need be given if, under extraordinary circumstances, either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) There is a suspension of the redemption of units of a Trust under section 22(e) of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A Trust temporarily delays or ceases the sale of its units because it is unable to invest amounts effectively in
accordance with applicable investment objectives, policies and restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. During the 60 day period described in condition 3 above, the Sponsors will maintain a secondary market in units that
could be acquired by affected unitholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The applicable sales charge for the purchase of units of a Trust for Trust unitholders who wish to exercise the Exchange
Privilege within the first five months from the date of their purchase of units of a Trust, where the applicable public
offering price for the Trust units being purchased includes higher sales charges than the sales charges applicable
to the units being exchanged, will be the greater of the reduced sales charge (up to 1.5% of the public offering price
of each unit (or per 1,000 units for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for the Equity Securities Trust)), or
an amount which, when coupled with the sales charge actually paid on purchase of the units being exchanged, would equal
the sales charge applicable to direct purchases of the quantity of Trust units being acquired, determined as of the
date of the exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The applicable sales charge for the purchase of units of a Trust for Redemption Trust unitholders who wish to exercise
the Conversion Offer within the first five months from the date of their purchase of units of a Redemption Trust, where
the applicable public offering price for the Trust units being purchased includes higher sales charges than the sales
charges applicable to the units being converted, will be the greater of the reduced sales charge (up to 1.5% of the price
of each unit (or per 1,000 units for Mortgage Securities Trust or per 100 units for the Equity Securities Trust)), or
an amount which, when coupled with the sales charge actually paid on purchase of the units being converted, would equal
the sales charge applicable to direct purchases of the quantity of Trusts units being acquired, determined as of the
date of the conversion.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is registered as a closed-end management investment company that was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Delaware. On May 27, 1988, applicant filed a Notification of Registration on Form N&hyph;8A, pursuant
to section 8(a) of the Act. On June 8, 1988, applicant filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;2 pursuant to both
the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. On August 11, 1988, this registration statement became effective
registering 700,000 shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, and applicant commenced the initial public
offering of the stock as soon as practicable thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On March 29, 1991, the applicant's board of directors adopted a resolution recommending liquidation and dissolution
of applicant. On or about April 26, 1991, a proxy statement describing the proposed Plan of Complete Liquidation and
Dissolution (``the Plan'') and relating to the annual meeting of shareholders to be held on May 20, 1991, was mailed
to all shareholders of record. Applicant's shareholders approved the Plan at the annual meeting of shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On May 21, 1991, applicant commenced the sale of its portfolio securities, and sold all of its securities by June
30, 1991. Applicant's common stock ceased trading on the NASDAQ National Market System as of the close of business
on May 20, 1991, the date its shareholders approved the Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. As of May 20, 1991, applicant's 700,100 shares of common stock outstanding were held by 405 record shareholders.
As of May 17, 1991, applicant's common stock had a net asset value per share of $10.0365 ($7,026,553.65 in the aggregate).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. On July 23, 1991, in accordance with the Plan, applicant's board of directors authorized, and applicant deposited
with AmSouth Bank N.A., of Birmingham, Alabama (``the Liquidating Agent''), the amount of $6,825,975.00 for payment,
at $9.75 per share, of the first liquidating distribution to all shareholders of record as of May 20, 1991. The Liquidating
Agent paid this first liquidating distribution to applicant's shareholders upon receipt of their respective stock
certificates or satisfactory lost share affidavits and indemnity agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On November 4, 1991, applicant's board of directors authorized a final liquidating distribution in the amount
of $88,842.69, representing $.1269 per share, for payment to those shareholders entitled to receive the first distribution.
On November 8, 1991, the Liquidating Agent made this final distribution. Six shareholders, owning a total of 440.4062
shares delivered their stock certificates and properly executed letters of transmittal after November 8, 1991 and
received their distributions ($4,349.85 in the aggregate, $9.8769 per share) at various times after November 8,
1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors, the Fund created a liquidating trust to pay off its creditors.
$67,340.55 was transferred to the trust shortly after its creation. All expenses of liquidation have been paid, however,
and no funds remain in the liquidating trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicant's expenses for liquidating were approximately $24,549 in legal fees and costs, $11,608 in accounting
fees and costs, $4,125 in printing fees and costs, and $4,000 in directors' fees, all of which expenses were allocated
to applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicant paid $12,143.92 in brokerage commissions following approval of the Plan. Of that amount, $11,743.92
was paid to Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach, Inc. of Birmingham, Alabama. Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach, Inc. is an ``affiliated
person'' as that term is defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Act, of applicant and of Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Investment
Advisors, Inc., applicant's investment adviser. $400.00 in brokerage commissions was paid to Porter, White &amp;
Yardley, Inc. which is not an ``affiliated person'' of applicant or Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Investment Advisors,
Inc. Applicant represents that the commissions charged by Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach Investment Advisors, Inc. and
by Porter, White and Yardley, Inc. were competitive with the brokerage commissions and fees charged by other brokers
for similar transactions and were consistent with section 17(e) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicant has no shareholders, assets or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant is not engaged, nor does it propose to engage, in any business activities other than those necessary
to wind up its affairs.

The Office of the Secretary of Transportation proposes to add the record system, DOT/ALL&hyph;10, Debt Collection
File. The purpose of the system is the administrative management and collection of delinquent debts. The debts include
past due loan payments, overpayments, fines, penalties, fees, damages, interest, leases, sales of real or personal
property, etc., due to the Department of Transportation and debts due to other Federal departments and agencies that
may be referred to the Department of Transportation for collection to the extent the Department of Transportation
controls funds due the debtor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority for the maintenance of this system is the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89&hyph;508;
Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;365; and Executive Orders 9397 and 11222. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals receiving benefits in the form of salary and/or other forms of compensation already have disclosed the
subject information to a federal agency; therefore this system presents no undue threat to privacy rights of individuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A description of the steps taken to safeguard these records is given under the appropriate heading of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 system of records notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No changes to existing procedural or exemption rules are required for this proposed new system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this report is to comply with the Office of Management and Budget Circular, A&hyph;130, Appendix I,
dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 25, 1993.

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Redisclosure of a mailing address from the IRS may be made only for the purpose of debt collection, including to a debt
collection agency in order to facilitate the collection or compromise of a Federal claim under the Debt Collection
Act of 1982, except that a mailing address to a consumer reporting agency is for the limited purpose of obtaining a commercial
credit report on the particular taxpayer. Any such address information obtained from the IRS will not be used or shared
for any other DOT purpose or disclosed to another Federal, state, or local agency which seeks to locate the same individual
for its own debt collection purpose.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->

e. Data base information consisting of debtor's name, Social Security Number, and amount owed may be disclosed to
the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service or to any other Federal, state,
or local agency for the purpose of conducting an authorized computer matching program in compliance with the Privacy
Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended, so as to identify and locate delinquent debtors in order to start a recoupment
process on an individual basis of any debt owed DOT by the debtor arising out of any administrative or program activities

of unpaid financial obligations owed the U.S. Government from an individual affiliated with the DOT. An exception
to this routine use is an individual's mailing address obtained from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->
Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f)) or the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C.
3701(a)(3)). The disclosure, once determined to be valid and overdue, is limited to information necessary to establish
the identity of the individual, including name, address, and taxpayer identification number (Social Security Number);
the amount, status, and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose for the sole purpose
of allowing the consumer reporting agency to prepare a commercial credit report.

This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1993 BMW 840Ci that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar to a vehicle
that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified by its manufacturer
as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;009) has petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1993 BMW 840Ci passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle
which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1993 BMW 850Ci. Champagne has submitted information indicating
that Bayerische-Motoren Werke A.G., the company that manufactured the 1993 BMW 850Ci, certified that vehicle as
conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards and offered it for sale in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 840Ci to the 850Ci, and found the two models to be substantially
similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1993 model 840Ci, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1993 model 850Ci that
was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1993 model 840Ci is identical to the certified 1993 model 850Ci with
respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

NHTSA to decide whether 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300CE convertible passenger cars (Model ID 124.061) are eligible for
importation into the United States. The vehicle which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1993 Mercedes-Benz
300CE convertible that was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its
manufacturer, Daimler Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300CE convertible to
its U.S. certified counterpart, and found the two vehicle to be substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1993 Mercedes-Benz
300CE convertible, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same
manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300CE convertible is identical
to its U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1991 BMW 325i 4-Door passenger car that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially
similar to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was
certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered
to conform to the standards.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;007)
has petitioned NHTSA to decide whether 1991 BMW 325i 4-Door passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United
States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1991 BMW 325i 4-Door passenger car that
was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer, Bayerische
Motoren-Werke A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1991 BMW 325i 4-Door passenger car to its
U.S. certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with
most Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1991 BMW 325i
4-Door passenger car, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the
same manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1991 BMW 325i 4-Door passenger car is identical
to its U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102
