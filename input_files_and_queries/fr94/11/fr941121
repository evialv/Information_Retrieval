SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The NCUA Board is publishing its official staff commentary to Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations (Truth in Savings).
The commentary applies and interprets the requirements of Part 707 and is a substitute for individual staff interpretations.
The commentary incorporates much of the guidance provided when the regulation was adopted, and addresses additional
questions that have been raised about the application of its requirements. In addition, the Board is implementing
a provision of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, exempting accounts of unincorporated
business associations from coverage of Part 707. A minor housekeeping amendment is also made to Part 707.

(1) Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The purpose of the Truth in Savings Act (``TISA'') (12 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.) is to assist members in comparing share and
deposit accounts offered by credit unions and other depository institutions. TISA requires credit unions to disclose
fees, the dividend or interest rate, the annual percentage yield, and other account terms whenever a member requests
the information and before an account is opened. Fees and other information also must be provided on any periodic statement
the credit union sends to the member. Rules are set forth for share and deposit account advertisements and advance
notices to account holders of adverse changes in terms. TISA restricts how credit unions must determine the account
balance on which dividends or interest are calculated. TISA is implemented by part 707 of the NCUA's Rules and Regulations
(``part 707'') (12 CFR part 707), which becomes effective on January 1, 1995, for most credit unions. TISA authorizes
the issuance of official staff interpretations of the regulation.

(2) Rule Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, included a provision amending TISA. The
amendment changes the definition of account:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
(1) Account._The term ``account'' means any account intended for use by and generally used by consumers primarily
for personal, family, or household purposes that is offered by a depository institution into which a consumer deposits
funds, including demand accounts, time accounts, negotiable order of withdrawal accounts, and share draft accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
12 U.S.C. 4313(1). The Conference Report to the Act clarifies the intent of this amendment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 332 defines the term ``account'' for purposes of [TISA] as an account used by consumers primarily for personal,
family, or household use. The Conferees intend this section to provide a business purpose exemption similar to that
provided in the Truth in Lending Act. Under this provision, accounts of unincorporated businesses (i.e., generally,
non-profit entities) are exempt from coverage under [TISA].

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&hyph;652, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 179 (1994). In order to implement the letter and intent of this
new legislation, the Board is amending the definitions of the terms ``account'' (707.2(a)) and ``member'' (7072(q))
in Part 707, as well as other relevant references to unincorporated association accounts (Proposed Commentary,
comment 2(a)&hyph;3 has been removed from the final commentary). The FRB has already adopted similar changes to Regulation
DD. 59 FR 52657 (October 19, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In addition, a typographical error has been removed from section 707.6(b)(3). The redundant phrase ``dollar amounts
of the'' has been removed; so that the sentence now reads: ``The fees shall be itemized by type and dollar amounts.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is adopting these rule amendments without notice and comment. The Administrative Procedure Act provides
that notice and opportunity for public comment are not required if the Board finds that notice and public comment are
unnecessary or would be contrary to the public interest. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The Board believes such a finding is appropriate
in this case. The Congress has eliminated a class of accounts from Truth in Savings coverage, and the amendments merely
make that change. In light of the Congress' action, the Board has no discretion with regard to the regulatory change;
which is required by law and essentially ministerial. The other amendment removes a confusing redundancy in the rule.
These amendments are technical in nature and not subject to interpretation. For these reasons, the Board has determined
that publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking and providing opportunity for public comment for the following amendments
is unnecessary and would be contrary to the public interest.

(3) Commentary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 3, 1994, the Board published for comment a proposed commentary to Part 707 (59 FR 39486). The commentary is
designed to provide guidance to credit unions in applying the regulation to specific transactions and is a substitute
for, and a supplement to, individual staff interpretations. The Board received 47 comments: 3 from national trade
associations; 14 from state credit union leagues; 1 from a state credit union supervisor; 2 from state-chartered
credit unions; 21 from federal credit unions; 1 from a credit union data processor; 1 from a credit union consultant;
2 from law firms; 1 from an insurance company; and 1 from a bank holding company. Commenters generally supported the
proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board contemplates updating the commentary periodically to address significant questions that arise. Due to
the special needs of small, nonautomated credit unions, and for the reasons explained by the Board in the Final Rule
adopted at the July Board meeting, the Board has decided to extend the compliance date of part 707 until January 1, 1996
for credit unions that are not automated and are under $2 million in assets as of December 31, 1993. 59 Fed. Reg. 39425
(August 3, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In large measure, the commentary incorporates supplementary information accompanying prior rulemakings, and
reflects the views expressed therein without substantive change. (See final rule published on September 27, 1993
(58 FR 50394), and final rule, corrections and correcting amendments, published on March 22, 1994 (59 FR 13435).)
The commentary also addresses issues that have arisen since the publication of the regulation and technical suggestions
or concerns raised by commenters. NCUA's proposed commentary was published before the publication of the FRB's final
commentary to Regulation DD. 59 FR 40217. NCUA's final commentary adopts many of the changes made by the FRB in their
final commentary. The commentary also reflects NCUA staff's understanding of the FRB's interpretations which have
not been publicly published. The commentary, for the most part, does not repeat information provided in part 707.
The Board also notes, in response to seven commenters' requests for a delayed compliance date for all credit unions,
that most credit unions have already been granted 14 months by the Board to get ready for TISA and part 707. In addition,
credit unions can take advantage of the FRB's Regulation DD, and its compliance by other depository institutions,
which was implemented in June of 1993. 58 FR 271 (January 5, 1993). The Board notes that the commentary makes no substantive
changes to the actual regulation, but merely provides guidance. Therefore, the Board declines to extend the compliance
date of the rule; but, to provide credit unions time to comply with the guidance provided in this commentary, and to
provide parity to the compliance period provided by the FRB when it promulgated the final Regulation DD commentary,
the Board has made compliance with this commentary optional until a period of six months after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, at which time compliance with the commentary shall be mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To avoid unnecessary detail, the discussion accompanying the final commentary does not individually mention technical
amendments that clarify the proposed text but make no substantive change in meaning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 6, 1993, the Federal Reserve Board (``FRB'') published a proposal to amend the regulation's rules for
calculating the annual percentage yield for accounts that send dividends or interest prior to maturity (58 FR 64190).
(See also the notice extending the comment period published on January 13, 1994, 59 FR 1921.) This FRB proposed rule
was withdrawn on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24376). In its place, a new FRB proposed rule was published on May 11, 1994 (59 FR 24378),
as amended on July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35271). The FRB amendments focus on two issues: a desire for the annual percentage
yield to reflect the time value of money, and the concern of compliance costs and the impact on depository institutions
if the proposed rule is adopted. The NCUA Board is delaying action regarding any adoption of similar amendments to
part 707 until the completion of the FRB's rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a trade association for thrifts, correctly commented that the purpose of TISA was to enhance consumer
shopping of depository accounts at all financial institutions_credit unions, thrifts, and banks, and urged the
NCUA Board to stress this in the commentary. While the commenter is correct, the NCUA Board notes that the purpose is
already correctly stated in &sect;707.1(c) of the rule, and that the purpose of the commentary is to enhance and explain
the rule. Since this matter is already clearly covered in the rule, the Board has decided not to repeat it in the commentary.
In this same vein, the commenter requested that the NCUA Board encourage credit unions to institute deposit, as opposed
to share, accounts in order to provide uniformity of accounts for consumers. The Board does not agree with this comment
for many reasons. First, the FCU Act and many state acts require credit unions to have share accounts instead of deposit
accounts, and to change these laws is beyond the authority of the Board. Secondly, the members' equity, expressed
in share accounts, is a major defining characteristic of credit unions, and has served the credit union movement well
throughout its history. Thirdly, the Board does not believe that credit union uniformity in all respects with other
financial institutions has been proven to be a desirable goal. While many other financial institutions have been
faltering, credit unions, due to their uniqueness, have been growing better and stronger. The membership structure,
represented by share accounts, has kept them close to their members and enabled them to provide services unavailable
on the same terms from other entities. ``Not for profit, not for charity, but for service'' is a motto that characterizes
the entire credit union movement. For these reasons, the Board declines the commenter's suggestion.

In response to questions raised regarding applicability of the rule to United States-chartered credit unions with
overseas branches or offices, the Board would like to clarify that the rule does cover such operations, if accounts
at such locations are either insured, or insurable, by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). In
addition, if any foreign-chartered credit unions were to establish and maintain branch operations in the United
States under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), if accounts at such foreign-chartered branches were
insured or insurable by the NCUSIF, those operations would also be subject to the coverage of part 707. For this reason,
NCUA deleted a reference to state-chartered and federally-chartered credit unions in comment 1(c)&hyph;1.

One national trade association commenter suggested that the Board should adopt an additional appendix to Part 707
similar to Appendix C to Regulation DD, entitled ``Effect on State Laws.'' 12 CFR Part 230, App. C. Regulation DD's
Appendix C addresses inconsistent state requirements and provides procedures for institutions seeking preemption
determinations from the FRB. After receipt of a preemption request, the FRB generally will issue a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of its intent to make a preemption determination, and provide an opportunity for public comment. Notices of
final preemption determinations are also to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The commenter stated that NCUA had not shown any uniqueness reasons for varying from the FRB in not adopting a similar
appendix for Part 707; or at least by adopting more guidance in the commentary as to the preemption standards to be used,
and means for providing an opportunity to comment by the affected states and other interested parties. The commenter
also pointed out that by allowing affected states and other interested parties to comment, that the impact of any preemption
determination could be minimized upon the state. This is in accord with federal policy, as enunciated in Executive
Order No. 12612. Therefore, the Board has decided to adopt changes in the commentary to provide preemption standards,
and an informal notification process to affected states, allowing sufficient time and opportunity for comment,
before issuing any preemption determinations under Part 707. These changes are made in comments 1(d)&hyph;1 through
4. Four commenters requested that the requirement for the credit union requesting a preemption determination demonstrate
a compliance burden be deleted. One commenter believed that the requirement was reasonable, and should be retained.
The Board notes that demonstration of a burden is a caselaw prerequisite for a finding of preemption. Therefore, the
Board has not modified comment 1(d)&hyph;2.

Comment 2(a)&hyph;1 provides examples of accounts subject to the regulation. The FRB, as did NCUA, proposed to narrow
the regulation's coverage of trust accounts individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and simplified employee pension
(SEP) accounts, to minimize compliance burdens for institutions. Many FRB commenters supported the FRB's general
approach, but questioned whether the regulation should exclude accounts held by individuals pursuant to informal
trust arrangements such as ``Totten'' or payable on death (POD) trusts. These commenters noted the purpose of a Totten
trust is to avoid probate proceedings to transfer funds remaining in an account upon an accountholder's death. It
was also noted that the account's signature card may be the sole evidence of the trust relationship. The FRB commenters
suggested, and the FRB agreed, that consumers opening Totten and POD trust accounts be afforded the protections of
TISA and Regulation DD. Fourteen NCUA commenters agreed with the FRB's approach. The NCUA Board concurs, and the commentary
reflects this approach.

Comment 2(a)&hyph;3 in the proposed commentary was removed to reflect the amendments made in Part 707 to implement
the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. As discussed previously, this change exempts
unincorporated association accounts from coverage of TISA and Part 707. As a result, proposed comment 2(a)&hyph;3
is not incorporated into the final commentary. This change was also requested by thirteen commenters. Comment 2(a)&hyph;2(vii)
adds unincorporated nonbusiness association accounts as being exempt from the coverage of part 707, as required
by the new legislation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Fifteen commenters, including two national trade associations, requested guidance regarding permissible synonyms
for various types of accounts. For instance, whether credit unions could interchangeably use the term ``checking''
for ``share draft''; or the term ``certificate of deposit'' for ``term share.'' It is the opinion of the Board that
the chief overriding factor to the use of synonyms is whether it is accurate and not misleading. The key consideration
is whether a ``share account'' could be confused with being a ``deposit account,'' or vice versa. Generally, if a disclosure
uses the correct legal term of the account once, and the synonym is accurate, the use of the synonym is permissible.
For example, a disclosure stating that an account is a ``share draft'' account, that equates ``share draft'' with
``checking,'' which has a neutral (neither share not deposit) connotation will be permissible. However, it is never
permissible to equate a share account with a deposit account. For example, it is impermissible to call a ``share certificate''
a ``certificate of deposit,'' though both legally are ``term share'' accounts for TISA and Part 707 purposes. Similarly,
it is impermissible to refer to term share accounts as either ``time deposits'' or ``time accounts,'' which are terms
with inaccurate and misleading meanings in the term share context of part 707. The correct use of synonyms is provided
in comment 2(a)&hyph;5.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment 2(b)&hyph;1 illustrates the scope of commercial messages considered to be advertisements. The FRB, as did
NCUA, proposed that advertisements would not include direct oral discussions conducted in person regarding a specific
account. Many FRB commenters urged the FRB to expand the interpretation to include telephone conversations, but
the FRB declined. The FRB believes face-to-face discussions allow prospective customers to learn easily and quickly
about basic terms of the account (thus, fulfilling the purpose of the advertising disclosures). Also, the FRB stated
that at any time during a face-to-face conversation, consumers may request and receive written disclosures at that
time. Thus, the FRB commentary clarifies that except for information about an existing account, commercial messages
delivered via telephone or voice response machines are advertisements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NCUA proposed that telephone conversations initiated by a member or potential member about an account would not be
considered an advertisement. Proposed comment 2(b)&hyph;1. Two commenters, including a national trade association
comments, requested that NCUA maintain this comment in its final commentary. NCUA has kept this provision in the final
commentary, though it seems at variance with the FRB. The Board is mindful that NCUA's rule must be ``substantially
similar'' to the FRB, except where modifications are supported by credit union uniqueness reasons or the limitations
upon which dividends are paid. Unlike other financial institutions, many credit unions rely upon volunteer staffs
who have careers outisde of the financial institutions area. To expect volunteers to follow the technical, complex
advertising requirements while on the telephone to their colleagues, friends and neighbors, constituting their
fellow members, is unreasonable. Furthermore, it places an additional burden upon the volunteers for oral disclosures,
which generally will already have been made, or will be made, in written disclosures. Therefore, after careful review
and application of NCUA's TISA authority, and finding that sufficient uniqueness grounds exist for the NCUA Board
to grant a variance from the FRB's position, the NCUA Board adopts the position taken in the proposed commentary as
comment 2(b)&hyph;2(ii). Of course, telephone conversations remain subject to the requirements for oral responses
to inquiries. 12 CFR 707.3(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

One commenter inquired as to what requirements telephone response machines must follow. Telephone response machines
are subject to the electronic media exemption of &sect;707.8(e)(1), and NCUA's treatment of such machines is identical
to that of the FRB in Regulation DD. See comment 8(e)(1)(iii)&hyph;1. Another commenter requested guidance regarding
whether messages on ATM or other computer screens were subject to the electronic media exemption. They are. The coverage
of the electronic media exemption is discussed at comment 8(e)(2)(i)&hyph;1.

Five commenters criticized the example of $25 being offered to a parent or custodian to open an account for a minor in
proposed comment 2(f)&hyph;2. The commenters stated that under state laws the parent or custodian will often be a
joint accountholder on the minor's account. The Board, wishing to accurately reflect state laws, has deleted this
example from the commentary.

Two commenters requested a clarification regarding whether payment of an annual membership fee or dues (e.g., such
as payment of a membership fee to the National Association of Retired Credit Union Persons (NARCUP) for senior credit
union members) would be considered a bonus. A sufficient showing was made that such membership dues payments are not
made to open, renew, or maintain an account in the credit union, but instead are payments made to a third party (e.g.,
NARCUP) as a benevolent gesture to a certain group of credit union members (e.g., seniors, with regard to NARCUP).
For these reasons, the NCUA Board finds that such payments of an annual membership fee are not bonuses; and a clarification
has been made to comment 2(f)&hyph;3(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Like the FRB, the NCUA has clarified comment 2(f)&hyph;4 discussing the exclusion from bonuses of items of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis value 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
($10 or less). (See 26 CFR 1.6049&hyph;5(a)(2) published by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which discusses
the fair market value of property received.) One law firm commenter noted that the IRS citation provided by the FRB
may not provide a complete picture of the tax consequences of bonuses. The NCUA Board agrees and has deleted the IRS
citation from the final comment. Credit unions are strongly advised to consult their own tax attorneys, accountants,
or consultants regarding the tax consequences of the accounts they offer, as such matters are outside of the jurisdiction
of NCUA.

Eleven NCUA commenters, including a national trade association commenter, like many FRB commenters, expressed
concern about potential violations for failing to disclose as a bonus early in the year an individual item of de minimis
value deemed to be a bonus when aggregated with another de minimis item given in a separate promotional program involving
the same account later in the year. Comment 2(f)&hyph;5 provides guidance about aggregating only the market value
of items offered for the same promotional program.

Seven commenters, including a national trade association commenter, inquired whether the provision of free share
drafts or checks would be considered a bonus. After consultation with the FRB, NCUA has clarified that provision of
free share drafts or checks, whether provided to all members, or only to certain groups, such as minors or seniors,
would be considered the waiver of a fee and not a bonus. This is reflected in comment 2(f)&hyph;6(ii). Another commenter
requested that free meals given to the membership at an annual meeting be included as an example of a bonus, however,
under &sect;707.2(r), such items are considered ``non-dividend membership benefits.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked that the Board clarify whether the granting of a higher dividend rate on an account if the member
elects or uses certain services offered by the credit union (i.e., ATM card, direct deposit, other packaged or linked
account terms) would not be considered a bonus, based on the exclusion of dividends from the definition of bonus. The
Board confirms this in comment 2(f)&hyph;6(vii). Nor, based on definitional reasons, would such higher dividends
be considered an extraordinary dividend; this is confirmed in comment 2(m)&hyph;1.

(i) Dividend and Dividends
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has clarified in comment 2(i)&hyph;1, that state law determines the nature of an account for state-chartered
credit unions. This was generated in response to two commenters requesting clarification regarding whether federal
or state law determined the nature (share or deposit) of accounts offered by state-chartered credit unions. The Board
stresses that this is solely a matter of state law, as expressed in state statutes, regulations, interpretive orders,
or by any other official means. NCUA will not involve itself in determinations of whether an account offered by a state-chartered
credit union is a share or deposit account, but will rely upon applicable state law and the opinion of the relevant state
supervisory authority. Similar changes were made in comments 2(p)&hyph;1 and 2, concerning the definition of interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten commenters, including one national trade association, lamented that FCUs would not be able to offer fixed-rate
accounts, due to the dividend rate setting process described in comment 2(i)&hyph;1 through 3. The NCUA Board wishes
to stress that part 707 does not require FCUs to offer only variable-rate accounts. FCUs may offer fixed-rate accounts
as long as the FCU, by contract, agrees to give at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases in the initially
disclosed dividend rate. However, like a prospective rate set on a variable-rate account, if FCUs offer a fixed-rate
account, the NCUA Board believes that, as discussed in comment 2(i)&hyph;3, every effort should be made in order to
pay the prospective fixed-rate disclosed. The fact that a prospective rate is disclosed on a fixed-rate account,
instead of a variable-rate account, does not change the nature of the dividend setting process for share accounts.
To clarify this point, language has been added to comment 2(i)&hyph;1. Nor does NCUA believe that it is appropriate
to counsel credit unions to make their accounts variable-rate, as opposed to fixed-rate accounts, as requested by
a few commenters. The NCUA Board has no intention of limiting flexibility available under TISA and Part 707; the number,
type, and terms of accounts are decisions within the proper province of each credit union's board of directors and
not the federal government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten commenters believed that proposed comment 2(i)&hyph;2 promulgated a substantive federal dividend-setting
process methodology for all credit unions. The comment is set forth as guidance only, and was not meant to substantively
alter any contrary state laws. Therefore, the Board has modified the final comment to use nondirective language.
In addition, sample dividend-setting resolutions are also provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4, to provide guidance
to the boards' of directors of credit unions. The resolution provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4(i) may be used when the
dividend rate is declared after the close of a dividend period. The resolution provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4(ii)
may be used when the dividend rate is prospectively set before the close of the dividend period in question, but will
be ratified upon the occurrence of certain conditions at the close of the dividend period. Both resolutions contemplate
that a list or table of accounts followed by corresponding dividend rates will be attached to the resolution. This
will prevent credit unions from having to adopt a separate resolution for each account type. These resolutions are
not required, but are provided as guidance of the proper corporate form to be used in declaring dividends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nine commenters, including a national trade association commenter, questioned the guidance provided by proposed
comment 2(i)&hyph;3, which stated that prospective rates may be altered ``if sufficient funds are not available,
or in the event of a superseding event, such as a significant fluctuation in market rates, natural disaster or emergency
that alters the assumptions under which the `prospective rates' were made.'' The commenters questioned the legality
and prudence of the proposed comment. Two commenters supported the comment. Basically, NCUA proposed the comment
in reference to natural disasters, such as the recent California earthquake that destroyed several credit union
offices, resulting in extraordinary expenditures that reduced current and undivided earnings, therefore lessening
the amount of funds from which dividends are properly payable. To provide general guidance to credit unions affected
by disasters and similar situations, in order to reflect the unique nature of the dividend setting process, and to
provide commentary protection in the rare event that a credit union may need to lower a dividend in response to a natural
or man-made disaster, NCUA has retained the comment, as revised. It is the intention of the Board that credit unions
make every effort to meet the disclosed prospective rates on accounts when such rates are properly declarable, available,
and payable, and this guidance has also been added to comment 2(i)&hyph;3. However, the NCUA Board disagrees with
the position taken by the commenters that NCUA could alter applicable legal principles and agency interpretations
on the proper payment of dividends. The questioned statement reflects long-standing NCUA interpretations of section
117 of the FCU Act for federal credit unions, and is supported by well-grounded general corporate law in regards to
dividends, as expressed in legal encyclopedias, hornbooks and other sources. Although NCUA believes that the statement
would also be applicable for many state-chartered credit unions, since applicable state law controls the dividend
process for state-chartered credit unions, this clarification has also been added to the comment. For further information
on dividends, and when they are properly payable, NCUA refers state-chartered credit unions and their members to
relevant state law.

Four commenters requested a clarification as to whether the ``dividend declaration date'' was the date of the actual
board meeting on which a credit union's board of directors declares the dividend, or the actual effective date of the
dividend declaration. The importance of the dividend declaration date is to give members and potential members an
idea of the timing of the last paid, declared dividend. The NCUA Board never intended for the dividend declaration
date to be determined by use of a technical, complex formula. In order to reflect the intent of the use of dividend declaration
date, the Board has provided several examples of the types of statements indicating time periods that would comply
with the definition. The commenter also requested a clarification on whether ``prospective rates'' must be properly
declared by a credit union's board of directors. Because the declaration of a prospective rate is tantamount to the
declaration of an actual rate on an account (since only under rare circumstances would the board not adopt or ratify
a prospective rate), the declaration of a prospective rate should be approached by a credit union's board of directors
with the same responsibility as a formal declaration of an actual dividend rate. Further discussion of the dividend
rate setting process is contained in comments 2(i)&hyph;2 and 3 and an example of a resolution to declare prospective
dividend rates is provided in comment 2(i)&hyph;4(ii).

(m) Extraordinary Dividends
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A national trade association commenter, as well as a few other commenters, suggested that this comment be expanded
to discuss whether loan interest is considered an extraordinary dividend (no, as arises from the loan relationship
and not the share account relationship, FCUs must follow 12 CFR 701.24 in order to make a refund of interest on a loan);
the relationship of extraordinary dividends to the APYE (none, extraordinary dividends are excluded from the definition
of ``dividends'' and ``interest,'' and therefore do not enter into the APYE calculation); and the proper methods
for calculating extraordinary dividends (by any means determined by the board of directors of the credit union).
These changes have been incorporated into comment 2(m)&hyph;1. After study, staff advised the Board that extraordinary
dividends are often paid on bases not related to the amount of dividends in the account, such as evenly dividing the
amount to be distributed by the number of members, or through a formula tied to the number of credit union loan and share
account products used by the member. Since extraordinary dividends are not a component of the dividend rate, annual
percentage yield, or annual percentage yield earned, and are a unique practice of credit unions, the Board has determined
that any procedure devised by a board of directors may be used to figure extraordinary dividends. Of course, it is acceptable
if a board were to use either the daily balance method or average daily balance method to compute extraordinary dividends,
even though those methods are not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve commenters, including a national trade association, requested that credit unions be allowed to use the more
common term ``bonus dividends'' to describe ``extraordinary dividends.'' Originally, the NCUA Board has declined
to use the term ``bonus dividends'' for fears that members would confuse it with ``bonuses,'' as defined by part 707.
Final Rule, 58 FR 50394 at 50402 (September 27, 1993). However, after further reflection, given members' familiarity
with the distinctions between the two terms, and the long-standing credit union tradition of calling such irregular
dividends ``bonus dividends,'' the Board has revised its position. NCUA has no objection to the use of the term ``bonus
dividends'' as a synonym for ``extraordinary dividends,'' as has revised comment 2(m)&hyph;2 accordingly.

E (12 CFR 205.9). But accounts that permit other electronic fund transfers_and thus trigger Regulation E's requirement
to send statements at least quarterly_are not passbook savings accounts, and institutions must comply with the statement
disclosures in &sect;707.6 of this part. Accounts that send statements are not passbook accounts for purposes of

One commenter requested that NCUA clarify that credit unions must provide disclosures to potential members upon
request. This is already required in &sect;707.4(a)(2)(i) of the rule. The purpose of the commentary is to expound
upon, but not to repeat, the rule requirements. However, because the Board believes that it may assist credit unions
in complying with the rule, the regulatory requirement has been repeated in comment 2(u)&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters suggested that NCUA note that proposed comment 2(u)&hyph;2, suggesting that credit unions have
sound written procedures in place to identify those for membership, be modified to note its discretionary, rather
than mandatory, character. The NCUA Board agrees and has so modified comment 2(u)&hyph;2. In the case of a credit union
having a permissible indirect lending arrangement with a third party, such as an automobile dealer, credit union's
may invoke member verification procedures before providing account disclosures when the potential member is not
present at the credit union.

(x) Term Share Account

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed comment 2(x)&hyph;2 distinguishing between regular share club accounts and term share club accounts has
been revised extensively based on comments received and consultation with FRB staff. Basically, although club accounts
typically have one feature of a term share account (a maturity date), club accounts are not term share accounts unless
they also require a penalty of at least seven days' dividends for a withdrawal of funds during the first six days after
the account is opened_subject to exceptions permitted in Regulation D. 12 CFR part 204. As requested by many commenters,
the final comment 2(x)&hyph;2 explains distinctions between term share club accounts and regular share club accounts.
One national trade association commenter requested that NCUA provide the same club account commentary as did the
FRB. The Board agrees with, and has adopted, this approach. One national trade association suggested that all club
accounts should be treated as regular share accounts by NCUA. Since this position was not taken by the FRB in Regulation
DD, and no uniqueness reasons have been proffered to NCUA to differentiate credit union club accounts from club accounts
offered by other depository institutions subject to Regulation DD, this position has not been adopted by the NCUA
Board.

Comment 2(z)&hyph;1 clarifies that a share certificate permitting one or more rate adjustments prior to maturity
at the member's option is a variable-rate account. NCUA, like the FRB, believes it is important for members to receive
disclosures describing when their dividend rate and APY could change, such as any time limitations on when the option
may be exercised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a commenter, the Board has clarified comment 2(z)&hyph;2. In the proposed commentary NCUA summarized
that rate decreases and other term changes members' accounts required 30-day changes-in-terms notices to take effect.
The final comment clarifies that changes-in-terms notices are required for changes in terms adversely affecting
the member. The effective date of other, beneficial term changes would depend upon the account agreement and applicable
state law.

union's other accounts, as long as it is clear which disclosures are applicable to the member's accounts.'' 12 CFR
707.3(a). Since the Board did not mean to place an additional burden upon credit unions, but merely to paraphrase the
rule, to eliminate any potential confusion the Board has revised the comment to more closely pattern after the regulation.

Comment 3(b)&hyph;2 provides guidance on the specificity required when time periods are disclosed. For example,
the FRB believes slight variations in compounding cycles are consistent with the notion of ``monthly'' cycles, which
are often not based on an actual calendar month. Many FRB commenters generally supported the FRB's approach, but expressed
concern about the proposal's limitation of 28&hyph;33 days to describe a month. The FRB decided to adopt a standard
of roughly equivalent intervals occurring during a calendar year. The FRB believes this standard is consistent with
TISA, provides flexibility, and eases compliance. For the reasons provided by the FRB, the NCUA Board also adopts
this approach.

Comment 3(e)&hyph;1 reflects that disclosures need only be made as appropriate. Therefore, if a member telephones
a credit union for information, the credit union need not disclose a telephone number to call, as the member would obviously
already have that information. This clarification, requested by seven commenters, is added to comment 3(e)&hyph;1.
Another commenter requested that the Board clarify that this requirement applies only to employees and volunteers
acting in the course of credit union business. This change has also been adopted by the Board in comment 3(e)&hyph;1,
to reflect the unique nature and position of volunteers in credit unions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters requested that the oral response to inquires disclosures be simplified, such as by eliminating
any reference to past or prospective rates. To do so would require a change in &sect;707.3(e) of the regulation and
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Also, NCUA must stress that the need to disclose that rates are either past or
prospective is important to provide accurate, nonmisleading information to credit union members to reflect the
facts concerning share accounts. A national trade association commenter noted that proposed comment 3(e)&hyph;3
did not closely parallel the language of &sect;707.3(e). The Board agrees with the commenter, and, on further reflection
and to eliminate confusion, has deleted references in comment 3(e)&hyph;3 repetitive of &sect;707.3(e).

Comment 3(e)&hyph;3 has been added to conform to a change made in Regulation DD, as requested by five commenters, including

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRB commenters expressed concern about having to give new account disclosures when funds are transferred from one
account to another, such as when funds in a money market deposit account (MMDA) are transferred to a NOW account because
the consumer exceeded transaction limitations on the MMDA. Some requested clarification that disclosures at the
time of transfer are not required if disclosures (including change-in-terms notices, if appropriate) for both accounts
had previously been given. To minimize possible burdens the FRB adopted that standard in the FRB commentary. For similar
reasons, the NCUA Board adopts this position in comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FRB also received many comments regarding the proposed guidance for ``closed accounts.'' New account disclosures
would have been required if institutions deemed an account closed and then accepted a deposit from the consumer. FRB
commenters noted that consumers with accounts meeting an institution's criteria for a closed account_such as an
account having a $0 balance_do not necessarily intend to close the account. FRB commenters believed consumers would
be confused if new account disclosures were sent when a deposit is subsequently made. FRB commenters also expressed
concerns about the burden of monitoring accounts to ensure compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TISA allows institutions not to pay accrued but uncredited interest when a consumer closes an account. (See 12 U.S.C.
4303(c)(9).) Based on comments received by the FRB and upon further analysis, the FRB believes that if an institution
deems an account closed and treats accrued, but uncredited, interest as forfeited by the consumer, the institution
must deem a new account to be opened when a deposit is subsequently accepted. This approach provides flexibility for
institutions and consistent treatment for consumers regarding ``closed'' accounts. Five NCUA commenters agreed
with the Regulation DD approach. Five NCUA commenters, including a national trade association, disagreed with the
FRB's approach, on grounds that account terms may not have changed between an account's closing and its reopening;
that some credit union's data processing systems automatically opened the account with the former account's number;
and to modify systems would be a costly, unnecessary expense. While sympathetic to credit union's facing this predicament,
because these reasons do not reflect any credit union uniqueness points. NCUA is bound to follow the FRB's rationale,
and the NCUA Board adopts the FRB's approach. However, it is the belief of the Board that a credit union is not required
to grant a new account number to the holder of a reopened ``closed account''; all that is required by this rule is the
distribution of a new set of account disclosures. No data processing changes are contemplated by this commentary,
and this is reflected in a revision to comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1. The Board hopes that this revision will reduce the compliance
burden on credit unions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board does note that account closure for credit unions does not necessarily occur in the same manner as for other
depository institutions. A member may voluntarily close an account by actively terminating membership in a credit
union. For instance, under the Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. II, &sect;4, a member who withdraws all of his shareholdings
ceases to be a member. The membership of a member may also be terminated by action of the credit union. For instance,
a member may be expelled by majority vote of the membership under Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. XVI (and 12 U.S.C. 1764(a));
or an FCU may terminate a member's membership if the board of directors has adopted a nonparticipation policy, which
has been publicized to the membership (12 U.S.C. 1764(b)); or if a member falls outside of the credit union's field
of membership (e.g., the member moves out of the geographical coverage of a community-based credit union), unless
the credit union has adopted a ``once a member, always a member'' policy under Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. II, &sect;5.
If a member merely lets the membership share account drop below the stated par value, neither the membership nor the
account of the member are terminated. Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. III, &sect;3; NCUA Letter to Credit Unions No. 70 (November
29, 1982). Under the Standard FCU Bylaws, once an account is closed, and the membership terminated, both the membership
and the account must be reestablished. Therefore, the ``closed account'' guidance adopted by the NCUA Board conforming
to that of the FRB applies only to accounts closed by the member or the credit union in conformance with applicable federal
or state law. This clarification is made in comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1. This clarification agrees with guidance provided
in the preamble to the final part 707. 58 FR 50394 at 50414 (September 27, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;2 clarifies that an institution acquiring accounts through a merger or acquisition is not
required to provide new account disclosures. However, such accounts are required to calculate dividends by either
the daily or average daily balance method; comply with &sect;707.5(a)(1) if it chooses to change terms of the acquired
account; and follow the periodic statement requirements, if applicable. As the accounts are no longer offered, no
advertising rules should ever be triggered. NCUA does note that certain term share accounts no longer currently offered
may require new account disclosures if they are nonrollover or if new account disclosures would be required under
&sect;707.5. Private merger and purchase of asset and shares transactions are distinguishable, however, from acquisitions
or mergers involving the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). In a government-assisted acquisition,
the acquiring institution receives only the member's funds on account. The account contract or other legal obligation_the
terms and conditions of the account such as fees_stays (and ultimately terminates) with the failed credit union.
Thus, new account disclosures must be provided if the member chooses to open an account with the new institution. Also,
if fees are imposed before the new account relationship is established, the fee must be disclosed prior to imposition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two national trade association commenters, as well as fourteen other commenters, requested that a clarification
be issued regarding guidance in proposed comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1. Two commenters requested that the provision be
deleted as unnecessary and confusing. NCUA had proposed that if a member were to open separate subaccounts from a main
account and if the terms were identical to that of the main account, that new disclosures would not have to be provided
to the member. The commenters noted that the terms of an account will rarely be ``identical'' to those of a subaccount.
The Board agrees with the commenters, therefore the proposed comment (now comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;3) has been amended
to reflect that new disclosures need not be provided if the credit union has already provided combined disclosures
for the main and subaccount within a reasonable time of when the subaccount is opened and the applicable disclosures
are still accurate when the subaccount is opened.

As requested by a national trade association commenter, comment 4(a)(2)(i)&hyph;1 clarifies that institutions
are not required to send new account disclosures for accounts no longer offered to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A national trade association requested that NCUA offer credit unions the choice of offering members and potential
members either account disclosures or rate sheets in responses to requests for disclosures under &sect;707.4(a)(2).
Since the rule only permits account disclosures to be provided upon request, and the proposed rulemaking concerned
only Appendix C, the commentary to part 707, the commenter's request is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. The Board
would violate the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act to consider such an amendment in this final rule.
Also, as no credit union uniqueness arguments were presented, the NCUA Board does not believe that even if such request
were within the scope of this rulemaking, that it would adopt such an amendment.

sends the disclosure. This clarification is based upon a similar change made in the final Regulation DD commentary.

Comments 4(b)(1)(ii)(B)&hyph;1 and 4(b)(1)(ii)(C)&hyph;1, dealing with rate changes within the institution's

of funds, for example, are not ``solely'' in the institution's discretion. In response to FRB commenters' requests,
both comments were revised in Regulation DD for clarity and consistency. A national trade association commenter
has also made the request that NCUA conform to the Regulation DD commentary. For the reasons stated by the FRB, and for
uniformity, the NCUA Board has done so.

As requested by one commenter, comment 4(b)(2)(ii)&hyph;1 is modified from the proposal to reflect that state or
other law may affect an institution's ability to include in its contract specific member actions considered by the
institution to be a request to close the account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters failed to understand the necessity of mentioning the FCU bylaw restrictions on closing member's
accounts in proposed comment 4(b)(2)(ii)&hyph;1. Unlike banks and thrifts which can contractually close accounts
for non activity, an FCU cannot close a member's account when it drops below the par value of one share. Instead, the
FCU must give the member at least six months to bring the account back up to par value. To highlight this very important
membership distinction, the bylaw requirement is mentioned in the comment. The NCUA believes that it is a critical
distinction of the member of FCUs, and some state-chartered credit unions, and declines to remove the comment from
the final commentary.

Three commenters requested that the Board not require the par value of a share to be disclosed, arguing that it is a membership,
not a minimum balance, requirement. The NCUA Board disagrees with this approach. A member is generally not entitled
to membership rights, including transacting on accounts, until the par value of a membership share is fully paid-in.
Therefore, the payment of a full par value share is a minimum balance requirement, as is stated in comment 4(b)(3)(i)&hyph;1.

One national trade association commenter requested that the NCUA delete proposed comment 4(b)(3)(iii)&hyph;1,
as in the commenter's opinion, such disclosures are not necessary for credit unions that begin accruing dividends
for all deposits on the day of deposit. Even if all credit unions did begin to accrue dividends for all deposits on the
day of deposit, which even the commenter admits is not the case, the Board believes that its commentary should remain
substantially similar to that of the FRB. Therefore, the Board has left the proposed comment unchanged in the final
commentary.

The FRB provided additional guidance in comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1 for fees imposed for sending to consumers checks
that otherwise would be held by the institution. Comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;2 clarifies that photocopying fees are incidental
fees not required to be disclosed. NCUA has adopted both of these changes to conform to Regulation DD. In response to
a national trade association commenter, other clarifications have also been made by the NCUA Board: (1) That ``fees
related to the routine use of an account must be disclosed;'' and (2) that fees for statements returned to the credit
union because of a wrong address need not be disclosed. However, the Board disagrees with the commenter, and believes
that it is necessary, in order to conform with the final Regulation DD commentary, that dormant account fees and inactivity
fees be disclosed. This clarification is also made in the final commentary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters requested that the Board classify fee types not discussed in the proposed commentary: dormant account
fees, locator fees, overdraft line of credit access fees, wire transfers, and automated clearing house (ACH) transfers.
These fees have been classified in comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1. In response to another commenter, the Board has added
a reference that merely providing fee information to members in an account disclosure may not be enough to gain the
legal right to impose the fees involved under applicable state law.

(b)(5) Transaction Limitations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eleven commenters, including two national trade associations, requested that NCUA not require disclosures based
upon a credit union's bylaws that could be imposed and act as transaction limitations upon an account. The commenters
stated that it would place credit unions at an unfair competitive advantage with banks. One national trade association
argued that since the bylaw requirements were rarely invoked, that they should not be disclosed unless they were to
be invoked, in which case members would be notified through a change-in-terms notice. After consultation with FRB
staff, NCUA learned that the FRB does not require disclosure of notice of withdrawal, and other unusual, rarely invoked,
requirements under state and local law under Regulation DD. For reasons of parity, uniformity, and conformity, NCUA
also adopts this approach, reflected in comment 4(b)(5)&hyph;1(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Board does encourage credit unions to publicize bylaw limitations, and other policies, that could potentially
affect a member's ability to use his account. Credit unions are different from other financial institutions in that
the bylaws form a contract between the members and the credit union. Any restrictions upon a member's account arising
from the bylaws is as real as a restriction arising from the account contract. In fact, many members are unfamiliar
with their bylaws. There are presently no federal requirements for a credit union to publicize its bylaws among its
members, even though it has long been NCUA policy to encourage credit unions to educate their members regarding the
content of their credit union's bylaws. The Standard FCU Bylaws only require that FCUs make their bylaws ``available
for inspection by any member.'' Standard FCU Bylaws, Art. XIX, &sect;6. In state-chartered credit unions a member's
right to view the bylaws is dependent upon state law, which laws sometimes require a proper business purpose. If credit
unions believe the transaction limitations in the Standard FCU Bylaws to be too restrictive, it is suggested that
they consider petitioning the appropriate NCUA Region for a nonstandard bylaw amendment. However, FCUs are cautioned
that NCUA will not entertain petitions to change either Art. III, &sect;3 (allowing members at least 6 months to increase
a membership share to par in order to retain membership) or Art. III, &sect;5 (reserving the right to require 60 days'
notice on withdrawals, historically to be sued in the event of an emergency). Seven commenters agree with this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One national trade association commented that credit unions should not have to disclose suspension of services policies,
because such policies are not a common practice. For the reasons stated in the preceding paragraph, NCUA agrees with
this approach. While not encouraging their use, NCUA has opined that an FCU may suspend services to members who have
caused a loss to the FCU if a proper suspension of services policy is adopted by the FCU's board of directors. A proper
suspension of services policy should state: (1) When the services will be suspended; (2) which services are suspended
(e.g., ATM services, credit cards, loans, share draft privileges, preauthorized transfers, etc.); (3) note that
the member has a fundamental right to maintain a share account and vote in annual and special meetings; and (4) provide
for methods of reinstatement of services by the member. In addition, the suspension of services policy should be publicized
to members, and not operated discriminatorily, in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Regulation B (12
CFR part 202), the Bankruptcy Code, or any other applicable law. Due to the consequences deriving from a suspension
of services policy, NCUA believes that those credit unions having such policies should publicize them in detail to
their membership.

A national trade association commenter requested a revision of proposed comment 4(b)(8)&hyph;2, to reflect that
if a member already had a share account at a state-chartered credit union offering deposit accounts in accordance
with state law, share account disclosures would not be required. The commenter's position is unfounded. Since the
share account is a currently offered account, there are no grounds under either TISA or Part 707 to exempt it from the
disclosure requirements. Therefore, the final comment is unchanged. Similarly, two other commenters from Georgia
requested that the comment reflect certain unique provisions of Georgia law. NCUA believes that state law determines
whether an account is a deposit account or a share account for accounts in state-chartered credit unions. However,
to revise the comment to reflect one state's laws, to the exclusion of other states, would not be useful. Therefore,
the NCUA Board has modified comment 4(b)(8)&hyph;2 to reflect that state law controls the nature of accounts for accounts
in state-chartered credit unions. The Board believes that this action will enable state credit union supervisors
to provide proper guidance to state-chartered credit unions by interpreting various state laws without federal
interference.

Four commenters requested that NCUA clarify that credit unions that have complied with TISA and part 707 requirements

union to issue new accounts, including new certificates, on the mandatory compliance date of part 707. All that part

 that credit unions send a notice to certain members of the availability of disclosures, or the disclosures themselves,

using the daily balance or average daily balance method. Basically, no new accounts need be issued; only accurate
disclosures conforming to part 707 reflecting accounts need be available.

or disclosures, they cannot change terms by simply providing a change-in-terms notice, and to clarify that change-in-terms
notices can be included as a highlighted portion of a credit union's newsletter provided to all affected members.
Another commenter requested that guidance in the final NCUA Truth in Savings rule allowing notice by means of mail,

refers to those terms required to be disclosed under &sect;707.4(b), if the change may decrease the APY or adversely
affect the member. The NCUA Board believes the spirit and intent of TISA is that most changes in the required account
disclosures should be disclosed to members to enhance the ability of members to comparison shop for accounts.

believes that separate charges for deposit and withdrawal slips, which are typically provided along with checks,

slips are not within the institution's control, since the consumer determines the quantity ordered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters, including a national trade association, stated that proposed comment 6(a)&hyph;3 implied that
periodic statements were required for credit union accounts. The NCUA has revised comment 6(a)&hyph;1 to reflect
that periodic statements are not required on credit union accounts. However, any statement setting forth information
about an account (other than a term share or passbook account) that is provided to a member on a regular basis four or
more times a year, is a periodic statement subject to &sect;707.6. NCUA cautions credit unions that if transaction
information is provided on a periodic statement on a passbook account, that the credit union runs the risk of having
the account deemed a statement savings account subject to full periodic statement requirements. This position has
been taken after consultation with FRB staff.

Comment 6(a)&hyph;1 clarifies that if zero interest is earned during the period, institutions may disclose $0 for
interest earned (and the annual percentage yield earned) or omit the disclosure, at their option. This change was
made to conform to Regulation DD, and in response to one commenter's request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen commenters, including a national trade association commenter, requested that the issue of account status
information in proposed comment 2(t)&hyph;4 be addressed. Commenters questioned whether accounts not expressly
covered by the periodic statement requirement, such as term share and passbook accounts: (1) Were limited to account
status information; or (2) were subject to full application of the advertising regulation (12 CFR 707.8); or (3) whether
they could disclose any information on such accounts, including rate and APY information, as long as such information
was accurate and not misleading. After consultation with the FRB, the proposed comment was moved to comment 6(a)&hyph;3
and clarified to indicate that a credit union may provide any information regarding passbook (unless the provision
of transaction information on the account turns the passbook account into a statement share account covered by &sect;707.6)
and term share accounts on a periodic statement, as long as the information is accurate and not misleading. For definitional
reasons, the periodic statement requirements do not apply. Also, since the information is provided on an existing
account, and not as an inducement to open, maintain or renew an account, the advertising disclosures do not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter also asked whether account status information on covered accounts could include joint accountholders'
names, year-to-date earned dividends, transaction dates, and social security or tax identification numbers. These
issues are addressed in comments 6(a)&hyph;3 and 4.

A national trade association commenter requested a clarification that the ledger balance and collected balance
are not methods to calculate the APYE, but rather methods to determine the balance upon which to pay dividends. This
clarification has been made in comment 6(b)(1)&hyph;1. To provide more flexibility, and to conform to provisions
in Regulation DD, the Board has deleted statements in comment 6(b)(1)&hyph;1 indicating that credit unions must
use the same balance (collected or ledger) to accrue and pay dividends and to determine the annual percentage yield
earned.

To provide uniformity and parity with provisions of Regulation DD, the Board has adopted comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;2,
but has limited its application to interest-bearing deposit accounts. It would be difficult and burdensome, if not
impossible, for a credit union to state the amount of accrued dividends on a statement, since as discussed in comment
2(i)&hyph;3, such dividends are not generally properly declarable until the close of the dividend period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions may use a variety of terms to disclose dividends earned, and
that the regulation does not mandate use of the examples. In response to a national trade association commenter, NCUA
has conformed comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;4 to the final Regulation DD commentary, and credit unions are permitted, but
not required, to show the APYE and dividends as zero, on a closed account on the periodic statement. In response to two
commenters, NCUA has revised comment 6(b)(2)&hyph;5 to reflect that information, other than the dollar amount,
regarding extraordinary dividends may be disclosed on the periodic statement as long as it is not inaccurate or misleading.
The Board believes that information regarding the calculation of the extraordinary dividend, and additional APYE
and dividend rate figures taking into account the extraordinary dividend, would not be inaccurate or misleading
and might offer the member additional useful information on the accounts held by the member.

One national trade association requested that NCUA clarify proposed comment 6(b)(4)&hyph;2, opening or closing
an account midcycle. The commenter stated that when a member opens an account in the middle of a statement period the
credit union should be required to use the actual number of days the account has been opened, as opposed to the number
of days in the statement period. Comment 6(b)(4)&hyph;2 has not been changed, as it is in conformance with Regulation

Comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;1 has been expanded to reflect TISA's legislative history, which cites the ``low balance''
method as an example of a prohibited dividend calculation method.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;6 addressed ``dormant'' accounts. The FRB solicited and received numerous comment
on whether an institution should be permitted to withhold the payment of dividends for dormant accounts. Some FRB
commenters believed institutions should be permitted to withhold the payment of interest for dormant accounts,
if authorized by state or other law and the deposit contract. Other FRB commenters noted that what constitutes a ``dormant''
account varies widely among the states and institutions. These FRB commenters expressed concern about the impact
of the rule if any period of inactivity_however brief_could transform an account to dormant status. Still others
raised concerns whether TISA, which requires that interest be paid on the full amount of principal in the account each
day, permitted such an interpretation. (12 U.S.C. 4306(a).) Based on the comments received and further analysis,
the FRB believes that account inactivity does not affect an institution's duty to pay interest. (See comment 7(c)&hyph;3,
which provides that institutions must accrue interest on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account.) The
FRB believes this position_reflected in comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;6_is consistent with the purposes of TISA and the
rule that interest must be calculated for funds in accounts meeting minimum balance requirements for as along as funds
remain in the account. For the reasons stated by the FRB, the NCUA Board has revised its comment accordingly. Although
two commenters, including a national trade association commenter, requested that the Board revise this comment
to also include sample contract language, the Board notes that the FRB did not provide such language, and since the
language must be in accord with state law, any attempt to provide uniform national language might result in a disclosure
that would not accomplish its objectives in some states. Therefore, the Board declines to provide such sample contract
language. Another commenter insisted that NCUA meant ``inactive account,'' which could be defined by the credit
union by contract, rather than ``dormant account,'' which is defined by the state. However, NCUA has copied this section
from the FRB's Regulation DD, which concerns ``dormant accounts.'' Therefore, NCUA declines to make the nomenclature
change to ``inactive accounts,'' which might create a substantive variance from the FRB.

Several commenters criticized proposed comment 7(a)(1)&hyph;7, insufficient funds, which states that credit
unions are not required to pay dividends on deposits returned for insufficient funds. After consultation with FRB
staff, the NCUA Board, for reasons of parity, uniformity and conformity, declines to change the substance of the comment.
However, the comment has been reworded, as suggested by a commenter, to clarify its meaning.

Three commenters requested clarification on the time of day to determine the day's balance. As long as the time of day
used does not reflect the low balance for the day (such as after debits are taken and before credits are added), any uniform
time of day may be used. The time of day so chosen is not a required disclosure. The guidance was provided in the proposed
commentary and is in this final commentary as comment App. A, Part II, &sect;1&hyph;1.

Since no uniqueness reasons exist, NCUA has revised the proposed commentary to conform to Regulation DD in this final
commentary. The national trade association commenter also requested a definition of ``periodic rate'' in lieu of
proposed comment 7(a)(2)&hyph;2. However, for reasons of uniformity, conformity, and parity, the NCUA Board declines
to so modify this commentary. However, more clarification regarding periodic rates will be provided in a revision

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed comment 8(a)&hyph;2 would have required institutions using indoor signs advertising APY's for tiered-rate
accounts to state both the lower and higher dollar amount for the tier corresponding to the advertised APY. Many FRB
commenters convinced the FRB that stating both dollar amounts is unnecessary. Therefore, for reasons of uniformity
and parity, NCUA has adopted the Regulation DD change and the comment provides that a sign is not misleading or inaccurate
if it states the lower dollar amount of the tier corresponding to the advertised annual percentage yield.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institutions cannot advertise accounts as ``free'' or ``no cost'' (or terms of similar meaning) if maintenance and
activity fees can be imposed. Comment 8(a)&hyph;3 address the scope of ``maintenance and activity'' fees and addresses
advertisements for ``free'' accounts with optional electronic services. FRB commenters were divided on whether
fees for electronic services such as ATM access should preclude institutions from advertising accounts as free.
Based on the comments received and further analysis, the FRB believes that ATM services are not different from other
optional services such as home banking. Fourteen NCUA commenters, including two national trade associations, agreed
with the FRB's reasoning and position. For the reasons stated by the FRB, NCUA follows the FRB and has revised comment
8(a)&hyph;4(vi) accordingly. One commenter requested a cross-reference to comment 4(b)(4)&hyph;1 and 2 regarding
fee disclosures, which cross-reference has been added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FRB received numerous comments on its proposal to consider the term ``fees waived'' as similar to the terms ``free''
or ``no cost.'' Many FRB commenters opposed the proposed comment. They stated that the term ``fees waived'' necessarily
implies the existence of charges, and thus is distinguishable from the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.'' These FRB commenters
believed consumers would be unnecessarily disadvantaged if advertising fee waivers were restricted as proposed.
Others believed most consumers would not distinguish between the terms and that advertising accounts with ``waived
fees'' raised the concerns of Congress had in mind when prohibiting the advertisement of accounts as free or no-cost
or ``words of similar meaning.'' The FRB believes that ``fees waived'' is a term similar to ``free'' or ``no cost;''
thus, comment 8(a)&hyph;5 has been retained as proposed. For reasons of uniformity and parity, NCUA has followed
the FRB's position.

Comment 8(b)&hyph;3 provides guidance on advertising account for which institutions offer a number of versions

(c) When Additional Disclosures are Required
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation requires institutions to disclose additional information when the APY is advertised. Comment 8(c)&hyph;1
provides examples of account descriptions that do not trigger the additional disclosures. The FRB has eliminated
the reference to a bonus of 1% over an institution's current rate for one-year certificates as an example of a trigger
term. Based on comments it received and upon further analysis, the FRB believes a reference to an institution's own
rates (to which a ``bonus'' rate or margin will be applied) is not a trigger term if those rates are not readily determinable
from the advertisement itself. This position is consistent with the rules regarding trigger terms in advertisements
under the FRB's Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226). For these reasons, NCUA has conformed comment 8(c)&hyph;1 in this regard.
This clarification was also made in response to four commenters' requests.

One commenter requested clarification regarding whether messages on ATM and computer screens would be entitled
to this advertising exemption. The regulation states that this exemption is available for broadcast and electronic
media, such as radio and television, outdoor media, such as billboards, and telephone response machines. The Board
believes that ATM and computer screens are similar to these types of media in many respects. First, ATMs are part of
an electronic network, such as radio and television. Second, most ATMs are at locations outside of a credit union branch.
Third, only a limited amount of space is available to make a message available to a member. With this reasoning, the
Board has determined that ATM screens are subject to the electronic media exemption, and has clarified this in comment
8(e)(1)(i)&hyph;1.

(e)(3) Newsletters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A national trade association commenter noted that neither the letter, spirit, nor intent of TISA and part 707 would
be violated if credit unions were permitted to make newsletters available to potential members. Since potential
members must receive all required account disclosures upon becoming a member and opening an account, potential members
could not be harmed by receipt of a member newsletter containing accurate information, but not conforming in every
regard to the advertising requirements of part 707. It was also pointed out by the commenter that newsletters have
traditionally been used by credit unions as a tool to increase membership, and that it would be difficult, if not impossible,
for credit unions to prevent members from sharing newsletters with potential members sharing a common bond. The NCUA
Board, which created the newsletter exemption based upon credit union uniqueness, is sympathetic to these additional
reasons to expand availability of the newsletters to potential members. however, to do so at this time would require
a rule amendment to &sect;707.8(e)(3)(i), which would be beyond the scope of the initial, proposed rulemaking, and
therefore, impermissible under the Administrative Procedures Act. This being the case, the Board has not made any
changes to comments 8(e)(3)&hyph;1 and 2. The Board will continue to monitor this situation, and if additional Truth
in Savings rulemakings are necessary in the future, will consider requesting comments on a proposed amendment to
expand the newsletter exemption to cover potential member distribution. Similarly, another commenter asked that
the Board include information provided on an ATM screen under the newsletter exemption. As the FRB has clearly included
ATM screen messages as covered advertisements in the definition of ``advertisement,'' and NCUA must be substantially
similar to the FRB, NCUA declines to make this change, which also is outside of the scope of this rulemaking. However,
the Board has stated that ATM and computer screen messages may use the electronic media exemption. Comment (e)(1)(i)&hyph;1.

In response to commenters, NCUA has revised comments app.A.I.&hyph;2 and 3. Comment app.A.I.&hyph;2 adds that,
for leap year annual percentage yield calculations, the ``days in term'' figure used in the denominator should be
consistent with the length of term used in the dividends calculation. Comment app.A.I.&hyph;3 clarifies that the
guidance on the first tier of a tiered-rate account only applies when such information is provided in a rate table format,
and not in the written format of sample clauses provided at Appendix B, &sect;B&hyph;1(a)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to another commenter, NCUA added comment app.A.I.&hyph;4, which provides that term share club accounts

it is not in conformity with the FRB's position in Regulation DD and no uniqueness reasons exist for its existence.
As a result, proposed comment app.A.II.&hyph;3 has been renumbered comment app.A.II.&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. General formula. Comment app.A.II.A.&hyph;1 provides guidance about the treatment of accrued, but uncredited,
interest in the balances used to calculate the APYE. The FRB believes an inaccurate APYE would result if institutions
include accrued interest in the balance figure when statements are sent less frequently than interest is credited.
But when periodic statements are issued more frequently than interest is credited, accrued interest must be included
in the balance figure for APYE computation purposes. The NCUA adopts the Regulation DD position.

B. Special formula for use where periodic statements are sent more often than the period for which dividends are compounded.
Comment app.A.II.B.&hyph;1 has been adopted as proposed. Credit unions may use the special formula to calculate
an APYE on a quarterly statement whether or not a monthly statement is triggered by Regulation E during the quarter.
FRB commenters supported this rule as significantly reducing compliance burdens for institutions. For the same
reasons, NCUA adopts the Regulation DD position.

Comment app.A.II.B.&hyph;2 clarifies that the special formula requires institutions to use the actual number of

period is necessary to produce an accurate APYE for a specific consumer's account. For reasons of conformity and parity,
NCUA has also adopted the Regulation DD position.

 This commentary is the means by which the staff of the Office of General Counsel of the National Credit Union Administration
issues official staff interpretations of Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Good faith compliance with this
commentary affords protection from liability under section 271(f) of the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), 12 U.S.C. 4311.

Foreign applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Part 707 applies to all credit unions that offer share and deposit accounts to residents (including resident aliens)
of any state as defined in &sect;707.2(v) and that offer accounts insurable by the National Credit Union Share Insurance
Fund (NCUSIF) whether or not such accounts are insured by the NCUSIF. Corporate credit unions designated as such by
NCUA under 12 CFR 704.2 (definition of ``corporate credit union'') are exempt from part 707.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 Persons who advertise accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Persons who advertise accounts are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented accounts, such
as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members
who form a certificate account investment club. For example, if an agent places an advertisement that offers members
an interest in an account at a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, whether the account
is held by the agent or directly by the member.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 Preemption of state laws/Inconsistent requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 State law requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of TISA and part 707 are preempted to the extent
of the inconsistency. A state law is inconsistent if it requires a credit union to make disclosures or take actions
that contradict the requirements of the federal law. A state law is also contradictory if it requires the use of the
same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law, requires the use of a term different
from that required in the federal law to describe the same item, or permits a method of calculating dividends or interest
on an account different from that required in the federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Preemption determinations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A credit union, state, or other interested party may request the Board to determine whether a state law requirement
is inconsistent with the federal requirements. A request for a determination should be addressed to NCUA's Office
of General Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. Written preemption requests should cite (or include
a copy of) the allegedly inconsistent state law, demonstrate the inconsistency with TISA and part 707 and the burden
on credit unions, and formally request a preemption determination. The Office of General Counsel may provide other
interested parties, particularly affected states, an informal opportunity to comment on any request for a preemption
determination, unless it finds that such notice and opportunity for comment would be impracticable, unnecessary,
or contrary to the public interest. NCUA will publicize any preemption determinations using any means readily at
its disposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of preemption determinations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the Board, through its Office of General Counsel, determines that a state law is inconsistent, a credit union
may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or take actions relying on the inconsistent law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Reversal of determination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board reserves the right to reverse a determination for any reason bearing on the coverage or effect of state or
federal law.

5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of synonyms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Generally, it is not the purpose of part 707 to prohibit specific descriptive terms for accounts. For example, credit
unions can use adjectives and trade names to describe accounts such as ``Best Share Draft Account,'' or ``Ultra Money
Market Share Account.'' Synonyms for share, share draft, money market share, and term share accounts may be used to
describe various types of credit union share and deposit accounts as long as the synonym is accurate and not misleading.
For example, the following synonyms may be used:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The term ``checking account'' may be used to describe share draft accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The term ``money market account'' may be used to describe money market share accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The term ``savings account'' may be used to describe regular share and share accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. The terms ``share certificate,'' ``certificate account,'' or ``certificate'' may be used to describe share
certificates and other dividend-bearing term share accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. However, under no circumstances may a credit union describe a share account as a deposit account, or vice versa.
For example, the term ``certificate of deposit'' or ``CD'' may not be used to describe share certificates and other
dividend-bearing term share accounts. Similarly, the terms ``time account'' (used in Regulation DD, 12 CFR 230.2(u))
and ``time deposit'' (used in Regulation D, 12 CFR 204.2(c)) may not be used to describe term share accounts.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual percentage yield (APY) is required for disclosures for new accounts, oral responses to inquiries about
rates; disclosures provided upon request; initial disclosures (if the credit union chooses to provide full disclosures
instead of the abbreviated notice); notices prior to the renewal of a term share account, if known at the time the notice
is sent, and in advertising. The annual percentage yield shows the total amount of dividends for a 365 day period (or
a 366 day period for a leap year) on an assumed principal amount based on the dividend rate and frequency of compounding
as a percentage of the assumed principal (for accounts such as share or share draft accounts) or for the total amount
of dividends over the term of the account for term share accounts. The annual percentage yield assumes the principal
amount remains in the account for 365 days (366 days for leap year) or for the term of the account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
How Annual Percentage Yield Differs from Annual Percentage Yield Earned.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual percentage yield (APY) differs from the annual percentage yield earned (APYE). The annual percentage
yield earned is required for periodic statements only. The annual percentage yield earned shows the total amount
of dividends earned for the dividend or statement period as a percent of the actual average daily balance in the member's
account. Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals
during the period. The annual percentage yield and the annual percentage yield earned must be calculated according
to the formulas provided in Appendix A to this rule.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the two required methods (the daily balance is the other) of determining the balance upon which dividends must
be accrued and paid. The average daily balance method requires the application of a periodic rate to the average daily
balance in the account for the average daily balance calculation period. The average daily balance is determined
by adding the full amount of principal in the account for each day of the period and dividing that figure by the number
of days in the period.

account. The $20 is not a bonus because the $20 is not paid to the individual opening the account. Any item, including
cash, given or offered to a third party (that is not a joint member or joint owner in an account being opened) in exchange
for a member or potential member opening (or a member renewing or adding to) an account is not a bonus.

iv. Life savings benefits. Many credit unions offer life savings benefits to beneficiaries of deceased members.
Because the benefit accrues to a third party, such life savings plans offered are not bonuses.

Aggregation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. In determining if an item valued at $10 or less is a bonus, credit unions must aggregate per account per calendar year
items that may be given to members. In making this determination, credit unions aggregate per account only the market
value of items that may be given for a specific promotion. To illustrate, assume a credit union offers in January to
give members an item valued at $7 for each calendar quarter during the year that the average account balance in a share
draft account exceeds $10,000. The bonus rules are triggered, since members are eligible under the promotion to receive
up to $28 during the year. However, the bonus rules are not triggered if an item valued at $7 is offered to members opening
a share draft account during the month of January, even though in November the credit union introduces a new promotion
that includes, for example, an offer to existing share draft accountholders for an item valued at $8 for maintaining
an average balance of $5,000 for the month.

 Member savings placed in share accounts are equity investments, and the returns earned on these accounts are dividends.
Federal credit unions may only offer dividend-bearing and non-dividend-bearing share accounts. State-chartered
credit unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. State law, including without limitation
regulations and official interpretations, will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-chartered credit
unions are dividends. Dividends exclude the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during
a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits and extraordinary
dividends. Dividend-bearing accounts must be either fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions must follow appropriate law (state law for state-chartered credit unions and federal law for federal
credit unions) in determining dividend policies and declaring dividends. Generally, dividends may be viewed as
a portion of the available account and undivided earnings of the credit union which is set apart, after required transfer
to reserves, by valid act of the board of directors, for distribution among the members. As a matter of legal procedure,
members are usually not entitled to dividends until the following steps are completed: (1) The board of the credit
union develops a nondiscriminatory dividend policy, by establishing dividend periods, dividend credit determination
dates dividend distribution dates, any associated penalties (if applicable), and the method of dividend computation
for each type of share account; (2) the provisions for required transfers to reserves are made; (3) sufficient and
available prior and/or current earnings are available at the end of the dividend period; (4) the board formally makes
a dividend declaration in accordance with the credit union's dividend policy; and (5) dividends must be paid to members
by a credit to the appropriate share account, payment by check or share draft, or by a combination of the two methods.

3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
When available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions must follow the law of their primary chartering authority to determine when dividends are available.
Generally, it is the declaration of the dividend itself which creates the dividend and the member has no right to receive
a dividend until it is so declared. The decision of when to declare dividends lies within the official discretion of
each credit union's board of directors and cannot be abrogated by contract. An agreement to pay dividends on a share
account is generally interpreted not as an obligation to pay the stipulated dividends absolutely and unconditionally,
but as an undertaking to pay them out of the earnings when sufficiently accumulated from which dividends in general
are properly payable. Generally, ``prospective rates'' are rates set in good faith in advance of the close of a dividend
period, that may be altered if sufficient funds are not available, or in the event of a superseding event, such as a strike,
plant closure, significant fluctuation in market rates and/or a significant change in financial structure, natural
disaster or emergency that alters the assumptions under which the ``prospective rates'' were made. It is the intent
of TISA that all disclosure be accurate when made, and credit unions are urged to make every effort to ratify disclosed
``prospective rates.'' ``Prospective rates'' may also be referred to as ``projected rates'' or similar wording,
but not as ``estimated rates.'' (See comment 3(b)&hyph;2, prohibiting use of estimates).

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The importance of the dividend declaration date is to tie the last paid dividend to a certain period of time to place
members and potential members on notice that the last paid dividend is different from the next dividend to be paid.
In order to achieve this purpose, a credit union may use any of the following methods:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. ``As of 3/15/95'' (the date the board of directors last met and declared the last paid dividend).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. ``As of 3/31/95'' (the last day of the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. ``For the period 1/1/95 to 3/31/95'' (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. ``For the first quarter of 1995'' (the last dividend period upon which a dividend has been paid).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The dividend period is to be set by a credit union's board of directors for each account type, e.g., regular share, share
draft, money market share, and term share. The most common dividend periods are weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually,
and annually. Dividend periods need not agree with calendar months, e.g., a monthly dividend period could begin March
15 and end April 14.

The definition encompasses all irregularly scheduled and declared dividends, and as dividends, extraordinary
dividends are exempt from the ``bonus'' disclosure requirements. Extraordinary dividends do not have to be disclosed
on account disclosures, but the dollar amount of an extraordinary dividend credited to the account during the statement
period does have to be separately disclosed on the periodic statement for the dividend period during which the extraordinary
dividends are earned. Extraordinary dividends, like ordinary dividends, do not include the payment of a bonus or
other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses
or non-dividend membership benefits. See comments 2(f) 1 through 7 and 2(i) 1 through 4. Extraordinary dividends
may be calculated by any means determined by the board of directors of a credit union and may not be used in the annual
percentage yield earned calculation.

Member savings placed in deposit accounts are debt investments, and the return earned on these accounts is interest.
Federal credit unions are not authorized to offer any interest-bearing deposit accounts. State-chartered credit
unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. State law, including without limitation
regulations and official interpretations, will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-chartered credit
unions are interest. Interest excludes the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during
a year, the waiver of reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits, and extraordinary
dividends.

Differences between dividends and interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, dividends are returns on an equity investment (shares); interest is return on a debt investment (deposits).
Dividends, in general, are not properly payable until declared at the close of a dividend period; interest, in general,
is properly payable daily according to the deposit contract. Dividend rates are prospective until actually declared;
interest rates are set according to contract in advance and are earned on that basis. Share accounts establish a member
(owner)/credit union (cooperative) relationship; deposit accounts establish a depositor (creditor)/depository
(debtor) relationship.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A potential member is a natural person eligible for membership in a credit union, who has not yet taken the steps necessary
to become a member. The term also includes natural person nonmembers eligible to hold accounts in a credit union pursuant
to relevant federal or state law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Verification of eligibility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is recommended that credit unions have sound written procedures in place to identify those eligible for membership.
If these procedures include verification measures, such as an application process, verification telephone call
or letter to an employer or association within the field of membership, witnessing by an existing member, or similar
procedure, then the credit union may first verify the membership eligibility of a potential member before providing
account disclosures or other information to the potential member. This process of verifying a member's eligibility
status, making a recommendation for membership, and providing account disclosures should be completed within 20
calendar days. This period also applies when potential members not on credit union premises request disclosures.

 Within its sole discretion, the board of directors of a credit union may provide TISA disclosures to nonmembers who
are ineligible for membership or to hold an account at the credit union. If disclosures are made to such nonmembers,
it is the position of the Board that no civil liability can accrue to the credit union for any errors in such disclosures.

Relation to Regulation D. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulation D permits, in limited circumstances, the withdrawal of funds without penalty during the first six days
after a ``time deposit'' is opened. (See 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1)(i).) But the fact that a member makes a withdrawal as permitted
by Regulation D does not disqualify the account from being a term share account for purposes of this regulation (such
as withdrawals upon the death of the member, or within a ``grace period'' for automatically renewable term share accounts).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Club accounts, including Christmas club, holiday club, and vacation club accounts may be either term share or regular
share accounts, depending on the terms of the account. Although club accounts typically have a maturity date, they
are not term share accounts unless they also require a penalty of at least seven days' dividends for withdrawals during
the first six days after the account is opened.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Tiered-rate accounts are those accounts in which two or more dividend rates are paid on the account and are determined
by reference to a specified balance level. Tiered-rate accounts are of two types: Tiering Method A and Tiering Method
B. In Tiering Method A accounts, the credit union pays the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in
the account. This method is also known as the ``hybrid'' or ``plateau'' tiered-rate account. In Tiering Method B accounts,
the credit union does not pay the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account, but only on the
portion of the share account balance that falls within each specified tier. This method is also known as the ``pure''
or ``split-rate'' tiered-rate account. (See commentary to Appendix A, &sect;I, D.)

Minimum balance accounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. A requirement to maintain a minimum balance to earn dividends does not make an account a tiered-rate account. If dividends
are not paid on amounts below a specified balance level, then the account has a minimum balance requirement (required
to be disclosed under &sect;707.4(b)(3)(i)), but the account does not constitute a tiered-rate account. A zero rate
(0%) cannot constitute a tier. Minimum balance accounts are single rate accounts with a minimum balance requirement.

. Includes accounts in which the credit union does not contract to give at least 30 days advance written notice of decreases
in the dividend rate. An account meets this definition whether the rate change is determined by reference to an index,
by use of a formula, or merely at the discretion of the credit union's board of directors. An account that permits one
or more rate adjustments prior to maturity at the member's option, such as a rate relock option, is a variable-rate
account.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Differences between fixed-rate and variable-rate accounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. All ccounts must either be fixed-rate or variable-rate accounts. Classifying an account as variable-rate affects
credit unions three ways:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Additional account disclosures are required (&sect;707.4(b)(1)(ii));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Rate decreases are exempted from change-in-terms requirements (&sect;707.5(a)(2)(i)); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Advertising notice required (&sect;707.8(c)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fixed-rate accounts require a contract term obligating the credit union to a 30-day advance, written notice to members
before decreasing the dividend rate on the account. Term changes adversely affecting the member and rate decreases
cannot take effect until 30 days after such fixed-rate change-in-terms notices are mailed or delivered to members
(&sect;707.5(a)).

. Alal required disclosures (e.g., account disclosures, change-in-terms notices, term share renewal/maturity
notices, statement disclosures and advertising disclosures) must be made clearly and conspicuously, in a form the
member may retain. Disclosures need be made only as applicable (e.g., disclosures for a non-dividend-bearing account
would not include disclosure of annual percentage yield, dividend rate, or other disclosures pertaining to dividend
calculations).

Design requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Disclosures must be presented in a format that allows members and potential members to readily understand the terms
of their account. Credit unions are not required to use a particular type size or typeface, nor are credit unions required
to state any term more conspicuously than any other term. Disclosures may be made:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. In any order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. In combination with other disclosures or account terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. In combination with disclosures for other types of accounts, as long as it is clear to members and potential members
which disclosures apply to their account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Consistent terminology.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 A credit union must use the same terminology to describe terms or features that are required to be disclosed. For example,
if a credit union describes a monthly fee (regardless of account activity), as a ``monthly service fee'' in account
opening disclosures, the periodic statements and change-in-terms notices must use the same terminology so that
members and potential members can readily identify the fee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions are required to have disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the credit union
and a member at the time the member opens the account. This provision does not impose any contract terms or supersede
state or other laws that define how the legal obligations between a credit union and its membership are determined.

General rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Compliance with Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) is deemed to satisfy the disclosure requirements of this regulation,
such as when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. A credit union changes a term that triggers a notice under Regulation E, and the timing and disclosure rules of Regulation
E for sending change-in-terms notices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. A member adds an ATM access feature to an account, and the credit union provides disclosures pursuant to Regulation
E, including disclosure of fees before the member receives ATM access. (See 12 CFR 205.7.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. A credit union complying with the timing rules of Regulation E discloses at the same time fees for electronic services
(such as balance inquiry fees imposed if the inquiry is made at an ATM) that are required to be disclosed by this regulation,
but not by Regulation E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. A credit union relies on Regulation E's rules regarding disclosures of limitations on the frequency and amount
of electronic fund transfers, including security-related exceptions. But any limitation on the number of ``intra-institutional
transfers'' to or from the member's other accounts at the credit union during a given time period must be disclosed,
even though intra-institutional transfers are exempt from Regulation E.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When an account has multiple natural person member accountholders, delivery of disclosures to any member accountholder
or agent authorized by the accountholder satisfies the disclosure requirements of part 707.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions need not provide rate information orally. Disclosures need be made only as appropriate. For example,
the requirement to give a telephone number for a member to call about rates for interest-bearing accounts and dividend-bearing
term share accounts, would not be necessary for members calling the credit union for information. Also, the disclosure
reqirements are applicable only to credit union employees and volunteers acting the in ordinary course of credit
union business.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation to advertising. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The advertising rules do not cover an oral response to a question about rates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Existing accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph does not apply to oral responses about rate information for existing term share accounts or accounts
not currently offered. For example, if a member holding a one-year term share account requests dividend rate information
about the account during the term, the credit union need not disclose the annual percentage yield, unless the member
is calling for rate information under a maturity notice.

Permissible rounding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The annual percentage yield, annual percentage yield earned and dividend rate must be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth
of one percentage point (.01%) when disclosed. Examples of permissible rounding are an annual percentage yield calculated
to be 5.644%, rounded down and shown as 5.64%; 5.645% would be rounded up and disclosed as 5.65%. For account disclosures,
the dividend rate may be expressed to more than two decimal places.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The tolerance for annual percentage yield and annual percentage yield earned calculations is designed to accommodate

New accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
New account disclosures must be provided when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. A term share account that does not automatically rollover is renewed by a member.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. A member changes the term for a renewable term share account (from a one-year term share account to a six-month term
share account, for instance) (see comment 5(b)&hyph;5 regarding disclosure alternatives).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. A credit union transfers funds from an account to open a new account not at the member's request, unless the credit
union previously gave account disclosures and any change-in-terms notices for the new account (e.g., funds in a money
market share account are transferred by a credit union to open a new account for the member, such as a share draft account,
because the member exceeded transaction limitations on the money market share account).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. A credit union accepts a deposit from a member to an account that the credit union had previously deemed to be ``closed,''
under applicable federal or state law, for the purpose of treating accrued, but uncredited, dividends as forfeited
dividends. New account numbers are not required by this requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Acquired accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
New account disclosures need not be given when a credit union acquires an account through an acquisition of, or merger

New account disclosures need not be given when a member has already received disclosures covering several accounts,
and opens a new account properly disclosed by the already received combination disclosures, if the new account is
opened within a reasonable amount of time after receipt of the combination disclosures and if the received disclosures
and terms are accurate at the time the new account is opened.

Inquiries versus requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A response to an oral inquiry (by telephone or in person) about rates and yields or fees does not trigger the duty to provide
account disclosures. But, when a member asks for written information about an account (whether by telephone, in person,
or by other means), the credit union must provide disclosures unless the account is no longer offered to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When member's or potential member's request disclosures about a type of account (a share draft account, for example),
a credit union that offers several variations may provide disclosures for any one of them. No disclosures need be made
to nonmembers, though a credit union may provide disclosures to nonmembers within its sole discretion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the dividend rate and annual percentage yield, credit unions may disclose a periodic rate corresponding
to the dividend rate. No other rate or yield (such as ``tax effective yield'') is permitted. If the annual percentage
yield is the same as the dividend rate, credit unions may disclose a single figure but must use both terms.

For fixed-rate term share accounts paying the opening rate until maturity, credit unions may disclose the period
of time the dividend rate will be in effect by stating, or cross-referencing, the maturity date. For other fixed-rate
accounts, credit unions may use a date (such as ``This rate will be in effect through June 30, 1995'') or a period (such
as ``This rate will be in effect for at least 30 days'').

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A single composite annual percentage yield must be disclosed for stepped-rate accounts. (See Appendix A, Part I,
Paragraph B.) The dividend rates and the period of time each will be in effect also must be provided. When the initial
rate offered for a specified time on a variable-rate account is higher or lower than the rate that would otherwise be
paid on the account, the calculation of the annual percentage yield must be made as if for a stepped-rate account. (See

Minimum balance accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a credit union sets a minimum balance to earn dividends, the credit union may, but need not, state that the annual
percentage yield is 0% for those days the balance in the account drops below the minimum balance level when using the
daily balance method. Nor is a disclosure of 0% required for credit unions using the average daily balance method,
if the member fails to meet the minimum balance required for the average daily balance period.

Deeming an account closed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A credit union may, subject to state or other law, provide in account contracts the actions by members that will be treated
as closing the account and that will result in the forfeiture of accrued but uncredited dividends. An example is the
withdrawal of all funds from the account prior to the date dividends are credited. Credit unions are cautioned that
bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming a member's account closed until certain time periods are
extinguished if funds remain in a member's account.

Par value. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions must disclose any minimum balance required to open the account, to avoid the imposition of a fee, or to
obtain the annual percentage yield. Since members cannot generally maintain any accounts until the par value of the
membership share is paid in full, this section requires that credit unions disclose the par value of a share necessary
to become a member and maintain accounts at the credit union. The par value of a share and the minimum balance requirement
do not have to be the same amount (e.g., a credit union may have a $5 par value for a membership share, in order for accounts
to be opened and maintained, and a $100 minimum balance requirement, in order for the account to earn dividends). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The explanation of minimum balance computation methods may be combined with the balance computation method disclosures
(&sect;707.4(b)(3)(ii)) if they are the same. If a credit union uses different cycles for determining minimum balance
requirements for purposes of assessing fees and for paying dividends, the credit union must disclose the specific
cycle or time period used for each purpose (e.g., use of a midmonth statement cycle for determining dividends, and
use of a calendar month cycle for determining fees). Credit unions may assess fees by using any method. If fees on one
account are tied to the balance in another account, such provision must be explained (e.g., if share draft fees are
tied to a minimum balance in the regular share account (or a combination of the share draft and regular share accounts),
the share draft account must explain that fact and how the balance in the regular share account (or both accounts) is
determined). The fee need not be disclosed in the account disclosures if the fee is not imposed on that account.

disclose additional information such as the time of day after which deposits are treated as having been received the
following business day, and may use additional descriptive terms such as ``ledger'' or ``collected'' balances to
disclose when dividends begin to accrue. Under the ledger balance method, dividends begin to accrue on the day of deposit.
Under the collected balance methods, dividends begin to accrue when provisional credit is received for the item deposited.

deposits, fees associated with checks returned unpaid, fees for regularly sending to members share drafts that otherwise
would be held by the credit union, and overdraft line of credit access fees (if charged against the share account).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Other fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions need not disclose fees such as the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Fees for services offered to members and nonmembers alike, such as fees for certain travelers checks, for wire transfers
and automated clearinghouse (ACH) transfers, to process credit card cash advances, or to handle U.S. Savings Bond
Redemption (even if different amounts are charged to members and nonmembers).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Incidental fees, such as fees associated with state escheat laws, garnishment or attorneys fees, to change names
on an account, to generate a midcycle periodic statement, to wrap loose coins, for photocopying forms, for statements
returned to the credit union because of a wrong address, and locator fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Amount of fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions are cautioned that merely providing fee information in an account disclosure may not be sufficient
to gain the legal right to impose the fee involved under applicable law. Credit unions must state the amount and conditions
under which a fee may be imposed. Naming and describing the fee typically satisfies this requirement. Some examples
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. ``$4.00 monthly service fee''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. $7.00 and up'' or ``fee depends on style of checks ordered'' for check printing fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Tied-accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions must state if fees that may be assessed against an account are tied to other accounts at the credit union.
For example, if a credit union ties the fees payable on a share draft account to balances held in the share draft account
and in a regular share account, the share draft account disclosures must state that fact and explain how the fee is determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulation E statements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Some fees are required to be disclosed under both Regulation E (12 CFR 205.7) and part 707. If such fees, such as ATM transaction
fees, are disclosed on a Regulation E statement, they need not be disclosed again on a periodic statement required
under part 707.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Examples of early withdrawal penalties are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Monetary penalties, such a specific dollar amount (e.g., ``$10.00'') or a specific days' worth of dividends (e.g.,
``seven days' dividends plus accrued but uncredited dividends, but only if the account is closed'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Adverse changes to terms such as the lowering of the dividend rate, annual percentage yield, or reducing the compounding
or crediting frequency for funds remaining in shares or on deposit.

Relation to rules for IRAs or similar plans. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Penalties imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for certain withdrawals from IRAs or similar pension or savings plans

Disclosing penalties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Penalties may be stated in months, whether credit unions assess the penalty using the actual number of days during
the period or using another method such as a number of days that occurs in any actual sequence of the total calendar months
involved. For example, stating ``one month's dividends'' is permissible, whether the credit union assesses 30 days'
dividends during the month of April, or selects a time period between 28 and 31 days for calculating the dividends for
all early withdrawals regardless of when the penalty is assessed.

Rollover term share accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions are not required to provide a grace period, to pay dividends during the grace period, or to disclose whether
or not dividends will be paid during the grace period. Credit unions offering a grace period on term share accounts
must give the length of the grace period. Commentary, Appendix B, Model Clauses, &sect;B&hyph;1(i)(iv).

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions are required to state the amount and type of bonus, and disclose any minimum balance or time requirement
to obtain the bonus and when the bonus will be provided. If the minimum balance or time requirement is otherwise required
to be disclosed, credit unions need not duplicate the disclosure for purposes of this paragraph.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Dividends are not payable until declared and unless sufficient current and undivided earnings are available after
required transfers to reserves at the close of a dividend period. A disclosure explaining dividends educates members
and protects credit unions in the event that a prospective dividend cannot be paid, or is not properly payable. This
disclosure is required for all dividend-bearing share accounts. Term share accounts need not include a statement
regarding the nature of dividends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
State-chartered credit unions with interest-bearing deposit accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
State law controls the nature of accounts (i.e., whether an account is a share account or a deposit account). If a member
of a state-chartered credit union is opening only an interest-bearing deposit account, or is requesting account
disclosures only for an interest-bearing deposit account (if state law requires the depositor to hold a share account),
the disclosures must generally include the following information on any dividend-bearing share portion of the account
(e.g., membership share): the par value of a share; a statement that the portion of the deposit that represents the
par value of the membership share will earn dividends, and that dividends are paid from current income and available
earnings after required transfers to reserves. Further additional disclosures, such as a separate dividend rate
and annual percentage yield for the membership share, are not required (if the additional disclosures would agree
with the remainder of the account which is invested in an interest-bearing deposit).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Only members who receive periodic statements (provided regularly at least four times per year) and who hold accounts
of the type offered by the credit union as of the compliance date of part 707 (generally January 1, 1995) must receive
the notice. If following receipt of the notice members request disclosures, credit unions have twenty calendar days
from receipt of the request to provide the disclosures. Rate and annual percentage yield information in such disclosures
must conform to that required for disclosures upon request. As an alternative to including the notice in or on the periodic
statement, the final rule permits credit unions to send the account disclosures themselves, as long as they are sent
at the same time as the periodic statement (the disclosures may be mailed either with the periodic statement or separately).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of the notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The notice may be included on the periodic statement, in a member newsletter, or on a statement stuffer or other insert,
if it is clear and conspicuous. The notice cannot be sent in a separate mailing from the periodic statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Timing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The notice may accompany the first periodic statement after the compliance date for part 707, or the periodic statement
for the first cycle beginning after that date. For example, a credit union's statement cycle is December 15, 1994-January
14, 1995. The statement is mailed on January 15, The next cycle is January 15, 1995 through February 14, 1995, and the
statement for that cycle is mailed on February 15. The credit union may provide the notice either on or with the January
15 statement or on or with the February 15 statement, as it covers the first cycle after January 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Early compliance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions that provide the notice to existing members prior to the compliance date of part 707, must be prepared
to provide accurate and timely disclosures when, following receipt of the notice, members ask for account disclosures.
Such disclosures must be provided even if they are requested before the compliance date of part 707. Credit unions
who provide early notice to existing members need to comply with other aspects of part 707, but need not provide disclosures
already provided in compliance with part 707.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Form of notice. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may provide a change-in-term notice on or with a regular periodic statement or in another mailing (such
as a highlighted portion of a newsletter or statement stuffer insert). If a credit union provides notice through revised
account disclosures, the changed term must be highlighted in some manner. For example, credit unions may state that
a particular fee has been changed (also specifying the new amount) or use an accompanying letter that refers to the
changed term. Credit unions are cautioned that unless credit unions have reserved the right to change terms in the
account agreement or disclosures, a change-in-terms notice may not be sufficient to amend the terms under applicable
law.

Terms that change upon the occurrence of an event. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A credit union offering terms that will automatically change upon the occurrence of a stated event need not send an
advance notice of the change provided the credit union fully describes the conditions of the change in the account
opening disclosures (and sends any change-in-term notices regardless of whether the changed term affects that member's
account at that time).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Examples of changes not requiring an advance change-in-terms notice are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The termination of employment for employee-members for whom account maintenance or activity fees were waived

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Maturity dates on nonbusiness days. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the term of a term share account, credit unions may disregard the fact that the term will be extended
beyond the disclosed number of days if the maturity date falls on a nonbusiness day. For example, a holiday or weekend
may cause a ``one-year'' term share account to extend beyond 365 days (or 366, in a leap year), or a ``one-month'' term
share account to extend beyond 31 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Ways to disclose when the annual percentage yield will be available include the use of:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. A specific date, such as ``October 28''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative timing rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the alternative timing rule, a credit union that offers a 10-day grace period would have to provide the disclosures
at least 10 calendar days prior to the scheduled maturity date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Club accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If members have agreed to the transfer of payments from another account to a club term share account for the next club
period, the credit union must comply with the requirements for automatically renewable term share accounts_even
though members may withdraw funds from the club account at the end of the current club period.

In the case of a change-in-terms that becomes effective if a rollover term share account is subsequently renewed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. If the change is initiated by the credit union, the disclosure requirements of this paragraph. (Section 707.5(a)
applies if the change becomes effective prior to the maturity of the existing term share account.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. If the change is initiated by the member, the account opening disclosure requirements of &sect;707.4(b). (If
the notice required by this paragraph has been provided, credit unions may give new account disclosures or disclosures
that reflect the new term.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a member receives a notice prior to maturity on a one-year term share account and requests a rollover to a six-month
account, the credit union must provide either account opening disclosures including the new maturity date or, if
all other terms previously disclosed in the prematurity notice remain the same, only the new maturity date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Providing disclosures within a reasonable time. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, 20 calendar days after an account renews is a reasonable time for providing disclosures. For term share
accounts shorter than 20 days, disclosures should be given prior to the next scheduled renewal date. For example,
if a term share account automatically renews every seven days, disclosures about an account that renews on Wednesday,
December 6, 1995, should be given prior to Wednesday, December 13, 1995.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions are not required to provide periodic statements. If they provide periodic statements, disclosures
need only be furnished to the extent applicable. For example, if no dividends are earned for a statement period, credit
unions need not state that fact. Or, credit unions may disclose ``$0'' dividends earned and ``0%'' annual percentage
yield earned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Regulation E interim statements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When a credit union provides regular quarterly statements, and in addition provides a monthly interim statement
to comply with Regulation E, the interim statement need not comply with this section unless it states dividend or rate
information. (See 12 CFR 205.9). For credit unions that choose not to treat Regulation E activity statements as part
707 periodic statements, the quarterly periodic statement must reflect the annual percentage yield earned and dividends
earned for the full quarter. However, credit unions choosing this option need not redisclose fees already disclosed
on an interim Regulation E activity statement on the quarterly periodic statement. For credit unions that choose
to treat Regulation E activity statements as part 707 periodic statements, the Regulation E statement must meet all
part 707 requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Combined statements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may provide certain information about an account (such as a money market share account or regular share
account) on the periodic statement for another account (such as a share draft account) without triggering the disclosures
required by this section, as long as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The information is limited to information such as the account number, the type of account, balance information,
accountholders' names, and social security or tax identification number; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The credit union also provides members a periodic statement complying with this section for the account (the money
market share account or regular share account, in the example). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Other information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Additional information that may be given on or with a periodic statement, includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Dividend rates and corresponding periodic rates to the dividend rate applied to balances during the statement
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The dollar amount of dividends earned year-to-date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Bonuses paid (or any

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
consideration of $10 or less). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. Fees for other products, such as safe deposit boxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. Accounts not covered by the periodic statement disclosure requirements (passbook and term share accounts) may
disclose any information on the statement related to such accounts, so long as such information is accurate and not
misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
When statement and crediting periods vary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule permits credit unions, on dividend-bearing share accounts, to report the annual percentage yield earned
and the amount of dividends earned on a statement other than on each periodic statement when the dividend period does
not agree with, varies from, or is different than, the statement period. For dividend-bearing share accounts, credit
unions may disclose the required information either upon each periodic statement, or on the statement on which dividends
are actually earned (credited or posted) to the member's account. In addition, for accounts using the average daily
balance method of calculating dividends, when the average daily balance period and the statement periods do not agree,
vary or are different, credit unions may also report annual percentage yield earned and the dollar amount of dividends
earned on the periodic statement on which the dividends or interest is earned. For example, if a credit union has quarterly
dividend periods, or uses a quarterly average daily balance on an account, the first two monthly statements may not
state annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned figures; the third ``monthly'' statement will reflect
the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned for the entire quarter. The fees imposed disclosure must
be given on the periodic statement on which they are imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Length of the period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions must disclose the length of both the dividend period (or average daily balance calculation period)
and the statement period. For example, a statement could disclose a statement period of April 16 through May 15 and
further state that ``the dividends earned and the annual percentage yield earned are based on your dividend period
(or average daily balance) for the period April 1 through April 30.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dividend period more frequent than statement period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions that calculate dividends on a monthly basis, but send statements on a quarterly basis, may disclose
a single dividend (and annual percentage yield earned) figure. Alternatively, a credit union may disclose three
dividends earned and three annual percentage yield earned figures, one of each month in the quarter, as long as the
credit union states the number of days (or beginning and ending date) in each dividend period if it varies from the statement
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional voluntary disclosures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For credit unions not disclosing the annual percentage yield earned and dividends earned on all periodic statements,
credit unions may place a notice on statements without dividends and annual percentage yield earned figures, that
the annual percentage yield earned and dollar amount of dividends earned will appear on the first statement at the
close of the dividend (or average daily balance) period, or similar wording. Credit unions may also choose to include
a telephone number to call for interim information, if desired by a member.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ledger and collected balances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions that accrue interest using the collected balance method may use either the ledger or collected balance
methods to determine the balance used to determine the annual percentage yield earned. Ledger balance means the record
of the balance in a member's account, as per the credit union's records. (The ledger balance may reflect additions
and deposits for which the credit union has not yet received final payment). Collected balance means the record of
balance in a member's account reflecting collected funds, that is, cash or checks deposited in the credit union which
have been presented for payment and for which payment has actually been received. (See Regulation CC, 12 CFR 229.14).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of earned. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``earned'' is defined to include dividends and interest either ``accrued'' or ``paid and credited.'' Credit
unions may use either the ``ledger'' or the ``collected'' balance for either option. (See commentary to &sect;707.2(t).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Accrued interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions must state the amount of interest that accrued during the statement period, even if it was not credited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Terminology. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In disclosing dividends earned for the period, credit unions must use the term ``dividends'' or terminology such
as: ``Dividends paid,'' to describe dividends that have been credited; ``Dividends accrued,'' to indicate that
dividends are not yet credited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Closed accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a member closes an account between crediting periods and forfeits accrued dividends, the credit union may not show
any figures for ``dividends earned'' or annual percentage yield earned for the period (other than zero, at the credit
union's option).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Extraordinary dividends. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Extraordinary dividends are not a component of the annual percentage yield earned or the dividend rate, but are an
addition to the member's account. The dollar amount of the extraordinary dividends paid, denoted as a separate, identified
figure, must be disclosed on the periodic statement on which the extraordinary dividends are earned. A credit union
may also disclose information regarding the calculation of the extraordinary dividends, and additional annual
percentage yield earned and dividend rate figures taking into account the extraordinary dividend, so long as such
information is accurate and not misleading.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Periodic statements must state fees disclosed under &sect;707.4(b) that were debited to the account during the statement
period, even if assessed for an earlier period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Itemizing fees by type. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In itemizing fees imposed more than once in the period, credit unions may group fees if they are the same type. But, the
description must make clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee, for example, ``total fees for
checks written this period.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of fees that may 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 be grouped together are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Monthly maintenance with excess activity fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. ``Transfer'' fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed_such as $.50 for share deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. Fees for electronic fund transfers with fees for other services, such as balance inquiry or maintenance fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Identifying fees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement details must enable the member to identify the specific fee. For example:

i. Credit unions may use a code to identify a particular fee if the code is explained on the periodic statement or in documents
accompanying the statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Credit unions using debit slips may disclose the date the fee was debited on the periodic statement and show the
amount and type of fee on the dated debit slip.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation to Regulation E. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Disclosure of fees in compliance with Regulation E complies with this section for fees related to electronic fund
transfers (for example, totaling all electronic funds transfer fees in a single figure).

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions providing the beginning and ending dates of the period must make clear whether both dates are included
in the period. For example, stating ``April 1 through April 30'' would clearly indicate that both April 1 and April
30 are included in the period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Opening or closing an account mid-cycle. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

If an account is opened or closed during the period for which a statement is sent, credit unions must calculate the annual
percentage yield earned based on account balances for each day the account was open.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibited calculation methods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation methods that do not comply with the requirement to pay dividends on the full amount of principal in the
account each day include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The ``rollback'' method, also known as the ``grace period'' or ``in by the 10th'' method, where credit unions pay
dividends on the lowest balance in the account for the period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The ``increments of par value'' method, where credit unions only pay dividends on full shares in an account, e.g.,
a credit union with $5 par value shares pays dividends on $20 of a $24 account balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. The ``ending balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the balance in the account at the end of the
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. The ``investable balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on a percentage of the balance, excluding
an amount credit unions set aside for reserve requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
v. The ``low balance'' method, where credit unions pay dividends on the lowest balance in the account for any day in
that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of 365-day basis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may apply a daily periodic rate that is greater than 1/365 of the dividend rate_such as 1/360 of the dividend
rate_as long as it is applied 365 days a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Periodic dividend payments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A credit union can pay dividends each day on the account and still make uniform dividend payments. For example, for
a one-year term share account, a credit union could make monthly dividend payments that are equal to 1/12 of the amount
of dividends that will be earned for a 365-day period (or 11 uniform monthly payments_each equal to roughly 1/12 of
the total amount of dividends_and one payment that accounts to the remainder of the total amount of dividends earned
for the period).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Leap year. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may apply a daily rate of 1/366 or 1/365 of the dividend rate for 366 days in a leap year, if the account will
earn dividends for February 29. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Maturity of term share accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions are not required to pay dividends after term share accounts mature. Examples include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. During any grace period offered by a credit union for an automatically renewable term share account, if the member
decides during that period not to renew the account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Following the maturity of nonrollover term share accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. When the maturity date falls on a holiday, and the member must wait until the next business day to obtain the funds.

Dormant accounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Credit unions must pay dividends on funds in an account, even if inactivity or the infrequency of transactions would
permit the credit union to consider the account to be ``inactive'' or ``dormant'' (or similar status) as defined by
state or other law or the account contract.

Insufficient funds
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. Credit unions are not required to pay dividends on checks or share drafts deposited to a member's account that are
returned for insufficient funds. If a credit union accrues dividends on a check that it later determines is not good,
it may deduct from the accrued dividends any dividends attributed to the proceeds of the returned check. If dividends
have already been credited before the credit union determines the item has insufficient funds, the credit union may
deduct the amount of the check and associated dividends from the account balance. The amount deducted will not be reflected
in the dividend amount and annual percentage yield earned reported for the next period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Account drawn below par value of a share
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a member draws his or her account below the par value of a share, dividends would continue to accrue on the account
so long as any minimum balance requirement is met. However, under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 if a member who reduces his or her share balance below the value of a par value share and does not increase the balance
within at least six months, the credit union may terminate the member's membership. State-chartered credit unions
may have similar termination provisions.

Determination of Minimum Balance to Earn Dividends

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Credit unions may set minimum balance requirements that must be met in order to earn dividends. However, credit unions
must use the same method to determine a minimum balance required to earn dividends as they use to determine the balance
upon which dividends will accrue and pay. For example, a credit union that calculates dividends on the daily balance
method must use the daily balance method to determine if the minimum balance to earn dividends has been met. Similarly,
a credit union that calculates dividends on the average daily balance method must use the average daily balance method
to determine if the minimum to earn dividends has been met. Credit unions may have a par value of a share that is different
from the minimum balance requirement to earn dividends. (See commentary to &sect;707.4(b)(3)(i)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Daily balance accounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Credit unions that require a minimum balance to earn dividends may choose not to pay dividends for days when the balance
drops below the required minimum balance if they use the daily balance method to calculate dividends. For example,
a credit union could set a minimum daily balance level of $200 and pay dividends only those days the $200 daily balance
is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Average daily balance accounts
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Credit unions that require a minimum balance to earn dividends may choose not to pay dividends for the average daily
balance calculation period in which the average daily balance drops below the required minimum, if they use the average
daily balance method to calculate dividends. For example, a credit union could set a minimum average daily balance
level of $200 and pay dividends only if the $200 average daily balance is met for the calculation period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Beneficial method
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Credit unions may not require members to maintain both a minimum daily balance and a minimum average daily balance
to earn dividends, such as by requiring the member to maintain a $500 daily balance and a prescribed average daily balance
(whether higher or lower). But a credit union could offer a minimum balance to earn dividends that includes an additional
method that is ``unequivocally beneficial'' to the member such as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. A credit union using the daily balance method to calculate dividends and requiring a $500 minimum daily balance
could choose to pay dividends on the account (for those days the minimum balance is not met) as long as the member maintained
an average daily balance throughout the month of $400.

at least half of the days in the period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Paying on full balance. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions must pay dividends on the full balance in the account that meets the required minimum balance. For example,
if $300 is the minimum daily balance required to earn dividends, and a member deposits $500, the credit union must pay
the stated dividend rate on the full $500 and not just on the $200.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Negative balances prohibited. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The daily or average daily balance on which dividends will be paid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Whether any minimum balance to earn dividends is met. (See commentary to Appendix A, Part II, which prohibits credit
unions from using negative balances in calculating the dividends figure for the annual percentage yield earned.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Club accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions offering club accounts (such as a ``holiday'' or ``vacation'' club accounts) cannot impose a minimum
balance requirement for dividends based on the total number or dollar amount of payments required under the club plan.
For example, if a plan calls for $10 weekly payments for 50 weeks, the credit union cannot set a $500 minimum balance
and then pay only if the member makes all 50 payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Minimum balances not affecting dividends. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may use the daily balance, average daily balance, or other computation method to calculate minimum
balance requirements not involving the payment of dividends_such as to compute minimum balances for assessing fees.

(b) Compounding and Crediting Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions choosing to compound dividends may compound or credit dividends annually, semi-annually, quarterly,
monthly, daily, continuously, or on any other basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawals prior to crediting date. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If members withdraw funds (without closing the account), prior to a scheduled crediting date, credit unions may delay
paying the accrued dividends on the withdrawn amount until the scheduled crediting date, but may not avoid paying
dividends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Closed accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Subject to state or other law, a credit union may choose not to pay accrued dividends if members close an account prior
to the date accrued dividends are credited, as long as the credit union has disclosed that fact. If accrued dividends
are paid, accrued dividends must be paid on funds up until the account is closed or the account is deemed closed. For
example, if an account is closed on a Tuesday, accrued dividends on the funds through Monday would be paid. Whether
(and the conditions under which) credit unions are permitted to deem an account closed by a member is determined by
state or other law, if any. Credit unions are cautioned that bylaw requirements may prevent a credit union from deeming
a member's account closed until certain time periods are extinguished. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Art. III, &sect;3 (members have at least 6 months to replenish membership share before membership can terminate and
the account is deemed closed). Such bylaw requirements may not be overridden without proper agency approval.)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Relation to Regulation CC. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may rely on the Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) and Regulation CC (12 CFR part 229) to determine,
for example, when a deposit is considered made for purposes of dividend accrual, or when dividends need not be paid
on funds because a deposited check is later returned unpaid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Ledger and collected balances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may calculate dividends by using a ``ledger'' balance or ``collected'' balance method, as long as the
crediting requirements of the EFAA are met (12 CFR 229.14).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Withdrawal or principal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions must accrue dividends on funds until the funds are withdrawn from the account. For example, if a check
is debited to an account on a Tuesday, the credit union must accrue dividends on those funds through Monday.

Section 707.8_Advertising
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Misleading or Inaccurate Advertisements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All advertisements are subject to the rule against misleading or inaccurate advertisements, even though the disclosure
applicable to various media differ. The word ``profit'' may be used when referring to dividend-bearing share accounts,
as it reflects the nature of dividends. The word ``profit'' may not be used when referring to interest-bearing deposit
accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Indoor signs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An indoor sign advertising an annual percentage yield is not misleading or inaccurate if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. For a tiered-rate account, it also provides the upper and lower dollar amounts of the tier corresponding to the advertised
annual percentage yield.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. For a term share account, it also provides the term required to obtain the advertised annual percentage yield.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
``Free'' or ``no cost'' accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of determining whether an account can be advertised as ``free'' or ``no cost,'' maintenance and activity
fees include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Any fee imposed if a minimum balance requirement is not met, or if the member exceeds a specified number of transactions.

ii. Check printing fees of any type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

member periodically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. Balance inquiry fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or home electronic credit union services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viii. Stop payment fees and fees for share drafts or checks returned unpaid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Similar terms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 An advertisement may not use a term such as ``fees waived'' if a maintenance or activity fee may be imposed because it
is similar to the terms ``free'' or ``no cost.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Specific account services.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions may advertise a specific account service or feature as free as long as no fee is imposed for that service
or feature. For example, credit unions offering an account that is free of deposit or withdrawal fees could advertise
that fact, as long as the advertisement does not mislead members by implying that the account is free and that no other
fee (a monthly service fee, for example) may be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Free for limited time.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 If an account (or a specific account service) is free only for a limited period of time_for example, for one year following
the account opening_the account (or service) may be advertised as free as long as the time period is stated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditions not related to share accounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions may advertise accounts as ``free'' for members that meet conditions not related to share accounts,
such as the member's age. For example, credit unions may advertise a share draft account as ``free for persons over
65 years old,'' even though a maintenance or activity fee may be assessed on accounts held by members that are 65 or younger.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiered-rate accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An advertisement for a tiered-rate account that states an annual percentage yield must also state the annual percentage
yield for each tier, along with corresponding minimum balance requirements. Any dividend rates stated must appear
in conjunction with the annual percentage yields for each tier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Stepped-rate accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An advertisement that states a dividend rate for a stepped-rate account must state all the dividend rates and the time
period that each rate is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Representative examples. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An advertisement that states an annual percentage yield for a type of account (such as a term share account for a specified
term) need not state the annual percentage yield applicable to every variation offered by the credit union or indicate
that other maturity terms are available. In an advertisement stating that rates for an account may vary depending
on the amount of the initial deposit or the term of a term share account, credit unions need not list each balance level
and term offered. Instead, the advertisement may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Provide a representative example of the annual percentage yields offered, clearly described as such. For example,
if a credit union offers a $25 bonus on all term share accounts and the annual percentage yield will vary depending on
the term selected, the credit union may provide a disclosure of the annual percentage yield as follows: ``For example,
our 6-month share certificate currently pays a 3.15% annual percentage yield.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Indicate that various rates are available, such as by stating short-term and longer-term maturities along with
the applicable annual percentage yields: ``We offer term share certificates of deposit with annual percentage yields
that depend on the maturity you choose. For example, our one-month share certificate earns a 2.75% APY. Or, earn a 5.25%
APY for three-year share certificate.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Trigger terms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are examples of information stated in advertisements that are not ``trigger'' terms: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. ``One, three, and five year share certificates available''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. ``Bonus rates available''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. ``1% over our current rate,'' so long as the rates are not determinable from the advertisement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Specified recent date. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If an advertisement discloses an annual percentage yield as of a specified date, that date must be recent in relation
to the publication or broadcast frequency of the media used. For example, the printing date of a brochure printed once
for an account promotion that will be in effect for six months would be considered ``recent,'' even though rates change
during the six-month period. Dividend rates published in a daily newspaper or on television must be a rate offered
shortly before (or on) the date the rates are published or broadcast. Similarly, dividend rates published in a daily
newspaper or on television must be a rate reflecting either the preceding dividend period, or a prospective rate,
and the option chosen should be noted.

Reference to date of publication. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An advertisement may refer to the annual percentage yield as being accurate as of the date of publication, if the date

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Indoor signs include advertisements displayed on computer screens, banners, preprinted posters, and chalk or peg
boards. Any advertisement inside the premises that can be retained by a member (such as a brochure or a printout from

Members outside the premises. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Advertisements may be ``indoor signs'' even though they may be viewed by members from outside. An example is a banner
in a credit union's glass-enclosed branch office, that is located behind a teller facing members but is readable by
passersby.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rounding for calculations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following are examples of permissible rounding rules for calculating dividends and the annual percentage yield:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The daily rate applied to a balance carried to five or more decimals. For example; .008219178%, 3.00% for a 365 day
year, would be rounded to no less than .00822%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. The daily dividends or interest earned carried to five or more decimals. For example; $.08219178082, daily dividends
on $1,000 at 3% for a 365 day year, would be rounded to no less than $.08219.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Exponents in a leap year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual percentage yield formula's exponent numerator will remain 365 in leap years. The ``days in term'' figure
used in the denominator should be consistent with the length of term used in the dividends calculation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
First tier of a tiered-rate account. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When credit unions use a rate table, the first tier of a tiered rate account is to be disclosed and advertised; ``Up to
but not exceeding *&blank;*&blank;*'', ``$.01 to *&blank;*&blank;*'', or similar language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Term Share Accounts Opened in Midterm.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For club accounts that meet the definition of a term share account, the annual percentage yield is based on the maximum
number of days in the term not to exceed 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Balance method.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The dividend or interest figure used in the calculation of the annual percentage yield earned may be derived from the
daily balance method or the average daily balance method. Regardless of the dividend calculation method, the balance
used in the annual percentage yield earned formula is the average daily balance. The average daily balance calculation
is the sum of the balances for each day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. The balance for each day
is based on a point in time; i.e. beginning of day balance, end of day balance, closing of day balance, etc. Each day's
balance, for dividend accrual and payment purposes, must be based on the same point in time and cannot be based on the
day's low balance.

2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Negative balances prohibited.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions must treat a negative account balance as zero to determine the balance on which the annual percentage
yield earned is calculated. (See commentary to &sect;707.7(a)(2).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. General Formula
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Accrued but uncredited dividends.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 To calculate the annual percentage yield earned, accrued but uncredited dividends:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. May not be included in the balance for statements that are issued at the same time or less frequently than the account's
compounding and crediting frequency. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends
daily and credits dividends monthly, the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily compounding.
Assume a credit union will pay $13.70 in dividends on $100,000 for the first day, $6.85 in dividends on $50,013.70 for
the second day, and $3.43 in dividends on $25,020.55 for the third day. The sum of each days balance is $175,000 (does
not include accrued, but uncredited, dividends amounts $13.70, $6.85, and $3.43), thereby resulting in an average
daily balance for the three days of $58,333.33.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Must be included in the balance for succeeding statements if a statement is issued more frequently than compounded
dividends is credited on an account. For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends
daily and credits dividends quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include dividends that
had accrued for the prior month. Assume a credit union will pay $411.78 in dividends on 30 days of $100,000, $427.28
in dividends on 31 days of $100,411.78, and $415.23 in dividends on 30 days of $100,839.06. The balance (average daily
balance in the account for the period) for the second 31 days is $100,411.78.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Rounding. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The dividends earned figure used to calculate the annual percentage yield earned must be rounded to two decimals to
reflect the amount actually paid. For example, if the dividends earned for a statement period is $20.074 and the credit
union pays the member $20.07, the credit union must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the annual percentage yield
earned. For accounts that pay dividends based on the daily balance method, compound and credit dividends or interest
quarterly, and send monthly statements, the credit union may, but need not, round accrued dividends to two decimals
for calculating the ``projected'' or ``anticipated'' annual percentage yield earned on the first two monthly statements
issued during the quarter. However, on the quarterly statement the dividends earned figure must reflect the amount
actually paid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Compounding frequency using the average daily balance method. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Any compounding frequency, including daily compounding, can be used when calculating dividends using the average
daily balance method. (See comment 707.7(b), which does not require credit unions to compound or credit dividends
at any particular frequency). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Statements triggered by Regulation E. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may, but need not, use this formula to calculate the annual percentage yield earned for accounts that
receive quarterly statements and that are subject to Regulation E's rule calling for monthly statements when an electronic
fund transfer has occurred. They may do so even though no monthly statement was issued during a specific quarter. This
formula must be used for accounts that compound and credit dividends quarterly and that receive monthly statements,
triggered by Regulation E, which comply with the provisions of &sect;707.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Days in compounding period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions using the special annual percentage yield earned formula must use the actual number of days in the compounding
period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Modifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Credit unions that modify the model clauses will be deemed in compliance as long as they do not delete information required
by TISA or regulation or rearrange the format so as to affect the substance or clarity of the disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Format. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may use inserts to a document (see Sample Form B&hyph;11) or fill-in blanks (see Sample Forms B&hyph;4
and B&hyph;5, which use double underlining to indicate terms that have been filled in) to show current rates, fees
or other terms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Disclosures for opening accounts. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The sample forms illustrate the information that must be provided to a member when an account is opened, as required
by &sect;707.4(a)(1). (See &sect;707.4(a)(2), which states the requirements for disclosing the annual percentage
yield, the dividend rate, and the maturity of a term share account in responding to a member's request.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Compliance with Regulation E. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Credit unions may satisfy certain requirements under Part 707 with disclosures that meet the requirements of Regulation
E. (See &sect;707.3(c).) The model clauses and sample forms do not give examples of disclosures that would be covered
by both this regulation and Regulation E (such as disclosing the amount of a fee for ATM usage). Credit unions should
consult appendix A to Regulation E for appropriate model clauses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Duplicate disclosures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If a requirement such as a minimum balance applies to more than one account term (to obtain a bonus and determine the
annual percentage yield, for example), credit unions need not repeat the requirement for each term, as long as it is
clear which terms the requirement applies to. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Guide to model clauses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the model clauses, italicized words indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided
(for example, a credit union might insert ``March 25, 1995'' in the blank for ``(date)'' disclosure). Brackets and
diagonals (``/'') indicate a credit union must choose the alternative that describes its practice (for example,
[daily balance/average daily balance]).

Sample forms. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The sample forms (B&hyph;4 through B&hyph;11) serve a purpose different from the model clauses. They illustrate
various ways of adapting the model clauses to specific accounts. The clauses shown relate only to the specific transactions
described.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Model A320&hyph;111, &hyph;211,
and &hyph;231 airplanes, that requires modification of the currently installed one-stage shock absorbers on the
main landing gear to two-stage shock absorbers. This amendment is prompted by the results of an evaluation of the air-to-ground
sensing logic relative to the operation of other airplane systems during landing in adverse weather conditions.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent a delay in sensing by the air-to-ground logic system that the
airplane is on the ground, which could prevent the airplane from achieving the landing distances specified in the
FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model A320&hyph;111, &hyph;211, and &hyph;231 airplanes was published
in the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 29, 1993 (58 FR 68786). That action proposed to require modification of the currently installed one-stage
shock absorbers on the main landing gear (MLG) to two-stage shock absorbers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter opposes the proposed requirement to modify the currently installed one-stage shock absorber on the
MLG to two-stage shock absorbers. This commenter states that the requirement is unnecessary due to the fact that the
one-stage absorbers currently installed on Model A320 series airplanes, when operated within the certification
standards of the airplane, do not adversely affect the airworthiness of these airplanes. This commenter contends
that the purpose of the two-stage shock absorber is solely to improve passenger comfort. The FAA does not concur that
this rulemaking action is unnecessary. The FAA has determined that the installation of the two-stage shock absorber
will improve the airplane's ability to achieve the landing distances specified in the FAA-approved Airplane Flight
Manual (AFM). Earlier activation of supplemental braking devices, which would be available by installing two-stage
shock absorbers, will enhance deceleration of the airplane when necessary to meet the required landing distances.
The FAA has re-evaluated the air-to-ground sensing logic, has reviewed all other available data, and has determined
that an unsafe condition exists with regard to the airplane failing to achieve the landing distances specified in
the FAA-approved AFM. Further, the FAA has determined that this AD action is necessary for airplanes of this type design
that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserts that the FAA is taking action contrary to the normal course of action by proposing to issue the
AD, when the French Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority
for France, has not issued a parallel AD. From this comment, the FAA infers that the commenter is requesting that the
rule be withdrawn or delayed until the DGAC issues a similar mandatory action. The FAA does not concur. While the United
States and France observe the provisions of the bilateral airworthiness agreement, it remains the responsibility
of the FAA to monitor and maintain the continuing airworthiness of U.S.-type certificated and registered airplanes.
The bilateral airworthiness agreements do not restrict the FAA from issuing AD's based upon its own finding of an unsafe
condition, regardless of the decision made by another airworthiness authority relative to the same subject. In that
the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists, and that action is necessary to correct that condition in the
fleet, the issuance of this AD is not only appropriate, but warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that the issuance of this rule be delayed until such time that a lower cost alternative can be
developed by the manufacturer. In the interim, this commenter suggests that the proposal be revised to require a periodic
inspection to be performed at 15-month intervals. The FAA does not concur. To delay this action would be inappropriate,
since the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists, a corrective modification is currently available,
and the modification must be accomplished to ensure continued safety. However, paragraph (b) of the final rule does
provide affected operators the opportunity to obtain approval from the FAA for alternative methods of compliance
by presenting justification for those alternatives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters request that the proposed compliance time of 12 months be extended to accomplish the proposed modification
of the shock absorbers. One of these commenters requests that the compliance time be extended to 24 months. The other
commenter requests that the compliance time be extended to 60 months, in light of the low probability of duplicating
the combination of factors that may result in an accident. This commenter notes that, due to the unavailability of
manpower and tooling, the proposed modification would result in a minimum of three days of downtime per airplane.
Both commenters state that the manufacturer may be unable to provide an adequate number of MLG pistons to accomplish
the modification within the proposed 12-month compliance time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs that the compliance time may be extended somewhat. The FAA acknowledges the low probability of duplicating
all of the factors that may result in an accident. However, in the unlikely event that all of the factors should be duplicated,
airplanes equipped with dual stage shock absorbers would be able to activate, at an earlier stage of the landing roll,
all available braking devices, including the deployment of ground spoilers, application of wheel brakes, and deployment
of thrust reversers. Proper activation of braking devices would permit the airplane to land within the distances
specified in the FAA-approved AFM. In light of the potential for these airplanes to overrun the end of the runway due
to delayed onset of braking, the FAA cannot concur with the one commenter's request to extend the compliance time to
60 months; the FAA considers that such an extension (five times the amount of time proposed) would adversely affect
safety. However, it was not the FAA's intent to impose an undue economic burden on operators by requiring them to take
airplanes out of service for an extended period of time due to the problem posed by a lack of available parts to accomplish
the modification required by this AD. Although the airframe manufacturer has indicated that ample modification
parts are currently available, the supplier of those parts has indicated that shipping to operators may take an extended
period of time. In light of this, the FAA has determined that an extension of the compliance time to 18 months is appropriate;
it will allow sufficient time for operators to obtain the parts necessary to accomplish the modification, while minimizing
the economic burden on operators. The FAA finds that this extension of the compliance time will not adversely affect
the safety of the fleet. Accordingly, paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised to extend the compliance time
to accomplish the modification of the shock absorber to 18 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined
that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 35 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 58
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $16,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $671,650, or $19,190 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

of certain modifications and inspections that will enhance the controllability of these airplanes in the unlikely
event of flight control malfunction or failure. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure airplane survivability
in the event of damage to fully powered flight control systems.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Lockheed Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 9, 1994 (59 FR 29745). That action proposed to require various modifications and inspections of the flight
controls, doors, and horizontal stabilizers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that reworking and changing the part number of the cross-tie interlock bungees on the servo
of the stabilizer, as described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;280, should be considered terminating
action for reworking the bungee, as described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;279. The FAA recognizes
that accomplishment of the actions in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;280 is an acceptable means of
compliance for accomplishment of the inspection and modification described in Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;27&hyph;279.
The FAA finds that no change to the final rule is necessary, since this provision was included in NOTE 2 under paragraph
(a) of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the compliance time of four years, as specified in paragraph(a) of the proposal, be revised
to coincide with parts availability. The commenter suggests a compliance time of four years after all required parts
kits are available or five years after the effective date of the AD. The FAA does not concur. In developing an appropriate
compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the
subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required parts and the practical aspect of installing the required
modifications within a maximum interval of time allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without
compromising safety. The FAA is not aware of any parts availability problem at this time and, therefore, assumes that
an ample number of required parts will be available for modification of the U.S. fleet within the proposed compliance
period. However, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments
to the compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable level
of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same commenter requests that the compliance time for accomplishment of Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;55&hyph;030
be extended. This commenter performs work in the area addressed by the service bulletin at heavy maintenance checks,
which occur at intervals of 27,000 flight hours. The commenter suggests that even a five-year compliance time would
be inadequate for accomplishment of this service bulletin. However, the commenter does not request a specific compliance
time. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time. The actions described in
Lockheed Service Bulletin 093&hyph;55&hyph;030 should take only five work hours to complete. The FAA has determined
that these actions can be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance visits (other than heavy maintenance
checks) or inspection activities without having a significant adverse effect on airplane scheduling. However,
paragraph (b) of the final rule does provide affected operators the opportunity to apply for an adjustment of the compliance
time if data are presented to justify such an adjustment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 236 Model L&hyph;1011&hyph;385 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 117 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
87 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts for certain modifications will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Required parts
for certain other modifications will be minimal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S.
operators is estimated to be $559,845 or $4,785 per airplane.

The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the accomplishment of the actions required
by this AD were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, the 4-year compliance time specified in paragraph
(a) of this AD should allow ample time for the modifications and inspections to be accomplished coincidentally with
scheduled major airplane inspection and maintenance activities, thereby minimizing the costs associated with
special airplane scheduling.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Jetstream Model HS 748 Series 2A and 2B
airplanes. This action requires repetitive replacement of the structurally significant items (SSI) on the nose
landing gear (NLG) and main landing gear (MLG) with serviceable SSI's. This amendment is prompted by fatigue testing
which revealed that the SSI's on the NLG and the MLG have a limited service life. The actions specified in this AD are
intended to ensure the replacement of the SSI's that have reached the maximum life limit; SSI's that are not replaced
could fail and lead to the failure of the NLG and MLG during taxi, take-off, or landing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Jetstream Model HS 748 series 2A and 2B airplanes. The CAA advises that
results of fatigue testing, conducting by Dowty [the manufacturer of the nose landing gear (NLG) and main landing
gear (MLG) components], revealed that certain components in the NLG and MLG specified as structurally significant
items (SSI) have a limited service life. Investigation revealed that these SSI's, upon attaining or exceeding a certain
number of landings, can fail due to fatigue-related stress. If not replaced in a timely manner, the SSI's could fail
and lead to the failure of the NLG and MLG during taxi, take-off, or landing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dowty has issued Service Bulletin 32&hyph;104E, dated January 20, 1993, which describes procedures for determining
the number of landings accumulated on the SSI's on the NLG and MLG, and repetitively replacing these SSI's with serviceable
SSI's at regulator intervals. The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to ensure the replacement of the SSI's that have reached
the maximum life limit. This AD requires initially determining the number of landings accumulated on the SSI's currently
installed in the NLG and MLG, and repetitively replacing the SSI's with serviceable SSI's, upon the accumulation
of a certain number of landings. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin
described previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There currently are no Jetstream Model HS 748 series 2A and 2B airplanes on the U.S. Register. All airplanes included
in the applicability of this rule currently are operated by non-U.S. operators under foreign registry; therefore,
they are not directly affected by this AD action. However, the FAA considers that this rule is necessary to ensure that
the unsafe condition is addressed in the event that any of these subject airplanes are imported and placed on the U.S.
Register in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should an affected airplane be imported and placed on the U.S. Register in the future, it would require approximately
40 work hours to accomplish the required actions, at an average labor charge of $60 per work hour. Based on these figures,
the total cost impact of this AD would be $2,400 per airplane, per replacement cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this AD action does not affect any airplane that is currently on the U.S. register, it has no adverse economic
impact and imposes no additional burden on any person. Therefore, notice and public procedures hereon are unnecessary
and the amendment may be made effective in less than 30 days after publication in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In keeping with the President's initiative to streamline government, the Department of State (DOS) has determined
that it will cease processing applications for the international crewmember certificate after December 31, 1994.
By this document, the FAA is informing the public that applications for international crewmember certificates,
currently processed under 14 CFR 121.721, 121.723 and 135.43, will no longer be processed by the FAA. These certificates,
which facilitate the entry and clearance of those crewmembers into International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
contracting states, will no longer be issued, and crewmembers will have to obtain standard international passports.
This document is intended to allow air carriers, pilots, and other affected individuals sufficient time to make alternative
arrangements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of State (DOS) informed the FAA that it will cease processing applications for the international crewmember
certificate after August 1, 1994, and recommended that the FAA require all applicants to possess valid passports
in accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2705. Since the FAA cannot verify an applicant's citizenship, and because DOS will cease
processing for the international certificate, the FAA also planned to cease processing applications by August 1,
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA requested an extension of the procedure, including DOS processing, beyond the August 1, 1994, deadline until
rulemaking could be completed to withdraw regulations (14 CFR 121.721, 121.723 and 135.43) that will be obsolete
due to DOS's actions. DOS agreed to extend its deadline until December 31, 1994. Since the FAA's notice and final rule
will not be complete before DOS ceases processing applications, the FAA is publishing this document to inform the
public that it will be futile to submit applications for the international crewmember certificate to the Flight Standards
District Office (FSDO) after December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is initiating rulemaking action to eliminate the regulatory procedures that will be obsolete after December
31, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving a proposed amendment to the Illinois regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Illinois
program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Illinois proposed revisions to
three statutes in the Illinois Surface Coal Mining Land Conservation and Reclamation Act (State Act) pertaining
to small operator assistance, vegetation requirements for lands eligible for remining, and fees and civil penalties.
The amendment is intended to incorporate the additional flexibility afforded by SMCRA, as amended by the Abandoned
Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. It is also intended to improve operational efficiency.

II. Submission of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated September 9, 1994 (Administrative Record No. IL&hyph;1550), Illinois submitted a proposed amendment
to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Illinois submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative. The proposed amendment
pertains to changes to the State Act (225 ILCS 720) which were enacted through Public Act 88&hyph;599 (HB 2349) and
signed into law by the Governor of Illinois on September 1, 1994. Illinois proposed to revise 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b)
concerning small operator assistance, to add new subsection 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e) concerning the responsibility
period for successful revegetation on lands eligible for remining, and to revise 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a) concerning
the deposit of fees and civil penalties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the September 29, 1994,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings
concerning the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 225 ILCS 720/2.02 Contents of Permit Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Illinois proposed revisions to 225 ILCS 720/2.02 pertaining to the Illinois Small Operator Assistance Program (SOAP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. At 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b), Illinois proposed to increase the amount of probable total annual production allowed
for SOAP applicants from 100,000 to 300,000 tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 5, 1990, the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 1990 amended section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA to increase the
amount of probable total annual production allowed for SOAP applicants to 300,000 tons. Therefore, the Director
finds Illinois' proposed revision at 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b) is consistent with and no less stringent than the counterpart
provision in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. At 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b), Illinois also proposed the deletion of existing program services at subsections (b)(1)
through (b)(3) and the addition of the following new or enhanced program services at subsections (b)(1) through (b)(6):
(1) The determination of probable hydrologic consequences, including the engineering analyses and designs necessary
for the determination; (2) the development of cross-section maps and plans; (3) the geologic drilling and statement
of results of test borings and core samplings; (4) the collection of archaeological information and any other archaeological
and historical information required by the Department, and the preparation of plans necessitated thereby; (5) pre-blast

plans for fish and wildlife habitats and other environmental values required by the Department under this Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 24, 1992, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA by adding substantively the same
new and enhanced program services at paragraphs (A) through (F). The Director finds that the provisions for program
services at 225 ILCS 720/2.02 (b)(1) through (b)(6) are consistent with and no less stringent than the provisions
for program services at section 507 (c)(1)(A) through (c)(1)(F) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. At 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b), Illinois also proposed the following SOAP assistance reimbursement requirement: A coal
operator that has received assistance pursuant to this subsection shall reimburse the regulatory authority for
the cost of the services rendered if the program administrator finds that the operator's actual and attributed annual
production of coal for all locations exceeds 300,000 tons during the 12 months immediately following the date on which
the operator is issued the surface coal mining and reclamation permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 24, 1992, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended SMCRA by adding section 507(h) which contains substantively
the same reimbursement requirement as the Illinois proposal for services rendered under section 507(c)(1) or section
507(c)(2) of SMCRA. The Illinois proposal is consistent with section 507(h) of SMCRA with one exception. It does not
require reimbursement for services provided under section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM currently interprets section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to require that the Secretary of the Interior, and not the State
regulatory authority, provide or assume the cost of training coal operators. In accordance with that interpretation,
Illinois is not, at this time, obligated to propose statutory provisions consistent with section 507(c)(2) and section
507(h) of SMCRA with regard to training assistance. Therefore, the Director finds the new provision at 225 ILCS 720/2.02(b)
is consistent with and no less stringent than the counterpart provision at section 507(h) of SMCRA as it relates to
reimbursement of costs for services rendered under section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA.

2. 225 ILCS 720/3.15 Vegetation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Illinois proposed to amend 225 ILCS 720/3.15 by adding two provisions at new subsection (e) pertaining to the responsibility
period for successful revegetation on lands eligible for remining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Illinois proposed to add a provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e) which requires that the responsibility period for
successful revegetation on lands eligible for remining shall be two full years after the last year of augmented seeding,
fertilizing, irrigation or other work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 24, 1992, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended SMCRA by adding section 515(b)(20)(B) which contains a substantively
identical requirement for lands eligible for remining. Therefore, the Director finds that the provision at 225 ILCS
720/3.15(e) is consistent with and no less stringent than the counterpart provision in section 515(b)(20)(B) of
SMCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Illinois also proposed a provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e) which clarifies that the requirement discussed in finding
2.a does not preclude application of responsible land management practices if they are deemed necessary and approved
by Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although section 515(b) of SMCRA does not contain a similar provision, this provision is not inconsistent with the
Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4) and 817.116(c)(4) which allow approval of selective husbandry practices
without restarting the responsibility period for revegetation if the regulatory authority obtains prior approval
from the Director that the practices are normal husbandry practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Illinois program contains counterpart regulations which allow approval of selective husbandry practices at
62 Illinois Administrative Code (IAC) 1816.116(a)(2)(C) and 1817.116(a)(2)(C). Illinois limits its approval
to normal conservation and land use management practices for the State of Illinois that are included in its regulations
at 62 IAC 1816.116 and 1817.116. The selective husbandry practices included in the Illinois program have been approved
by OSM as normal husbandry practices in accordance with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4) and 817.116(c)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director finds Illinois' proposed provision at 225 ILCS 720/3.15(e), when read in light of the regulatory
limitations at 62 IAC 1816.116(a)(2)(C) and 1817.116(a)(2)(C), is not inconsistent with the requirements of section
515(b)(20)(B) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(c)(4) and 817.116(c)(4).

3. 225 ILCS 720/9.07 Fees and Forfeitures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Illinois revised 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a) by requiring all fees and civil penalties collected under the State Act be deposited
into the Coal Mining Regulatory Fund instead of the general revenue fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision was proposed to comply with new requirements in the State Finance Act (30 ILCS 105). Illinois Public Act
88&hyph;599 established the Coal Mining Regulatory Fund and added section 6z&hyph;36 to the State Finance Act. Section
6z&hyph;36 requires all moneys collected as fees and civil penalties under the State Act be deposited into the Coal
Mining Regulatory Fund. The moneys in the fund will then be annually appropriated to the Department of Mines and Minerals
for the enforcement of coal mining regulatory laws and rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no direct Federal counterpart to 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a). However, the proposed amendment is not inconsistent
with the general requirements for permit fees at section 507(a) of SMCRA or 30 CFR 777.17 of the Federal regulations,
which establish provisions for permit fees. Also, the proposed amendment is not inconsistent with the general requirements
for civil penalties at Section 518 of SMCRA or 30 CFR 845 of the Federal regulations, which establish provisions for
assessment of civil penalties. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed revision to 225 ILCS 720/9.07(a)
is not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on the proposed amendment from various Federal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM is required to obtain the written concurrence of the EPA with respect to those
provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the
authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). None of the revisions that Illinois proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards.
Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (Administrative Record
No. IL&hyph;1551). EPA responded on September 27, 1994, that it had reviewed the proposed amendment and had no comment
to offer (Administrative Record No. IL&hyph;1554).

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above findings, the Director approves the proposed amendment as submitted by Illinois on September 9,
1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director is also taking this opportunity to make a correction to 30 CFR 913.10. The Department of Mines and Minerals
was empowered by the State Act at 225 ILCS 720/9.02 (formerly Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 96 1/2, Section 7909.02) to act
as the regulatory authority for the State of Illinois under SMCRA. Therefore, the existing designation at 30 CFR 913.10
which deems the Department of Mines and Minerals, Division of Land Reclamation as the regulatory authority in Illinois
is being removed. The Department of Mines and Minerals is designated as the regulatory authority in Illinois, and
30 CFR 913.10 is being revised to reflect this decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 913, codifying decisions concerning the Illinois program, are being amended
to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
the oversight of the Illinois program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Illinois of only such provisions.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the corresponding
Federal regulations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rulemaking establishes an interim Federal permitting program solely for sources participating in the Early
Reductions Program under section 112(i)(5) of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended. It is designed to provide a temporary
permitting mechanism until such time as permanent permitting programs become effective pursuant to title V of the
Act. Under this interim program, EPA will be able to permit early reductions sources in a timely manner, thus ensuring
that emission reductions achieved are maintained and providing assurance to participating sources that they have
qualified for the benefits of the Early Reductions Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also promulgated in this rulemaking are two amendments to the Early Reductions Rule. The first appends to enforceable
commitments made under the Early Reductions Program information on emission reduction measures employed to achieve
early reductions and the second clarifies deadlines for submitting post-reduction emission information to EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 rewrote existing section 112, which directs the EPA to establish national emission
standards for hazardous air pollutants (HAP). A new provision, section 112(i)(5), offers to sources that achieve
substantial early reductions of HAP emissions an extension in the compliance date for applicable standards to be
promulgated under section 112(d). To help implement this ``Early Reductions Program,'' EPA is acting in this notice
to promulgate an interim, limited scope permit program, pursuant to title V of the Act. This interim program will allow
EPA to process applications under the Early Reductions Program in a timely manner, until such time as comprehensive
title V permitting mechanisms become available. A detailed rationale for this rulemaking accompanied the proposal
notice, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 29, 1993 (57 FR 68804).

II. Summary of Significant Comments and Changes Since Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for the proposed early reductions permits rule ended on March 3, 1994, and EPA received five comment
letters. Copies of the comments reside in the docket for this rulemaking and are available for public inspection (see
``Docket'' in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section of this preamble for further information). A summary of public comments and EPA's responses to the comments
are contained in the background information document mentioned in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration of these comments and other deliberations within the Agency led to a few changes from the proposed permits
rule, although none of the changes altered the rule significantly. A brief summary of the more notable changes appear
in the list below (an expanded explanation of these changes is contained in the background information document).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A definition of ``post-reduction year'' has been added, as well as clarifying language pertaining to deadlines
for filing post-reduction emission information. These changes make clearer the requirements for demonstrating
that qualifying reductions have been achieved, and provide more flexibility to sources that wish to make reduction
demonstrations before the statutory deadline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed requirement to submit an application in a computerized format, in addition to the typed application,
has been deleted. The EPA has not yet settled on a computer format for such submittals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed rule contained a provision requiring permittees to report any deviations from permit terms or conditions
within ten days of occurrence. This requirement has been revised to require ``prompt'' reporting of deviations,
where ``prompt'' will be defined in each early reductions permit and will be based on the type and degree of the deviation.
This is consistent with similar language in the part 70 for State title V permit programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The procedures for making administrative amendments to existing early reductions permits have been revised.
The revisions are consistent with recently proposed revisions to the administrative amendments procedures specified
in the part 70 rule for State title V programs. The revised procedures clarify the permittee's actions in initiating
an administrative amendment and set the effective date of an amendment at 60 days after receipt by the Administrator
of the amendment application (assuming the Administrator does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not reject the amendment prior to that time).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also changed under the administrative amendments provisions of the rule is the list of actions qualifying as administrative
amendments (&sect;71.26(c)(1)). A new provision (&sect;71.26(c)(1)(v)) allows certain additional permit revisions
to be treated as administrative amendments provided that the Administrator determines, on a case-by-case basis,
that a proposed revision is similar to those qualifying actions already specifically listed. The new provision is
based upon a similar provision in the part 70 rule and is a response to certain commenters requests for additional flexibility
to make relatively insignificant changes at an early reductions source without having to wait for a lengthy EPA approval
process. Under the new provision, EPA would be able to process through administrative amendment procedures certain
changes not listed in paragraphs &sect;71.26(c)(1)(i) through (iv) but which are ministerial in nature and therefore
do not require the exercise of judgment on the part of EPA, or review by the public or affected States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Another proposed provision deleted in the final rule was the requirement that specialty permit applications contain
a statement indicating the source's compliance status with any applicable enhanced monitoring and compliance certification
requirements of the Act. This provision was included in the proposal because a similar provision appears in the part
70 rule. However, upon further reflection, EPA has realized that the provision is not relevant to early reductions
permit applications. This specialty permit program focuses narrowly on implementing the Early Reductions Program
for a defined early reductions source and associated HAP emissions, and within that context the only monitoring and
compliance certification requirements applicable to the early reductions source will be those delineated in the
specialty permit issued later to the participating company. Each specialty permit will implement the Act directive
to provide for enhanced monitoring on major sources by specifying monitoring requirements tailored to the early
reductions source and consistent with the characteristics of the Early Reductions Program. Compliance certification
requirements also will be imposed to comply with title V of the Act. However, it is inappropriate to ask a source to discuss,
in the permit application, its compliance status for these requirements because they do not yet exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rule preamble, EPA requested comment on whether the final early reductions permits rule should contain
procedures for minor permit revisions. Such procedures would be used to process changes that could not be processed
as administrative amendments but which encompass relatively minor changes to the source or its operation and, therefore,
would not warrant the longer (12 month) review and issuance process allotted to significant source changes. Two commenters
requested that EPA include minor permit revision procedures in the final rule to provide sources the ability to make
certain changes in the early reductions source quickly, which they consider to be key to remaining competitive within
their respective industries. The EPA has carefully considered the commenters' requests for a more expedited permit
revision procedure, and has decided not to include such a procedure at this time. There are two primary reasons for
this decision. First, the part 70 permit revision procedures are currently the subject of litigation in the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals. In part as a response to this litigation, EPA has proposed revisions to these part 70 procedures.
The current uncertainty over EPA's legal discretion to provide for expeditious permit revision procedures cautions
against providing for any such procedures here in this final rule. Second, as stated in the preamble to the proposal
of this rule, EPA believes the nature of these specialty permits, containing limitations that are uniquely tailored
to the facility, should reduce the need for permit revisions. Another factor that deemphasizes the need for a more
expedited revision procedure is the fact that a specialty permit will, relatively soon after permit issuance, be
transferred to the jurisdiction of the State, following which it will be subject to the revision procedures of the
State program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA may in the future decide to revise this rule to provide more expedited procedures for minor permit revisions.
However, EPA currently intends await the outcome of the revisions to part 70 before taking any such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, this notice also contains amendments to the Early Reductions Rule. One of the amendments, proposed
along with the early reductions permits proposal, is promulgated without change and appends to enforceable commitments
made under the Early Reductions Program the information on emission reduction measures employed to achieve early
reductions. Such information is required as part of a participant's post-reduction emission demonstration. The
other amendments mirror the changes described in item 1 of the above list pertaining to the post-reduction emissions
demonstration. These amendments make the Early Reductions Rule consistent with the permits rule promulgated in
this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The docket for this regulatory action is A&hyph;93&hyph;08. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the
information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The principal purposes
of the docket are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the rulemaking process, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The docket is available for public inspection at the EPA's Air
Docket, which is listed under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES

B. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, 10/04/93), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant''
and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order.
The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments
or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligation
of recipients thereof; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the ``Executive Order.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of Executive
Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that the specialty permits rule and the amendments
to the Early Reductions Rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business
entities. The EPA estimates that this rule will have no direct economic impact on any business entities for two reasons.
First, the Early Reductions Program is a voluntary program, an alternate means of complying with otherwise applicable
standards forthcoming under section 112(d) of the Act. Generally, companies would participate in the program if
they thought their compliance costs would be less than those associated with meeting otherwise applicable standards.
Costs could be less because the 90 (95) percent reduction threshold to qualify for an extension likely will be lower
than the reduction required by applicable section 112(d) standards. Moreover, the Early Reductions Rule provides
owners or operators considerable flexibility to average qualifying reductions among participating emissions
units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the specialty permits program rulemaking simply adapts for earlier use the intended mechanism for eventually
delineating and enforcing all Act requirements at individual facilities, namely the title V permit. Sources not
electing to participate in the Early Reductions Program would have to obtain title V permits anyway when comprehensive
title V. Therefore, this rulemaking does not add any additional requirements to participants. The impacts from the
requirements of title V were considered in the promulgated part 70 rule for State comprehensive programs (57 FR 32250).
Moreover, the proposed change to the Early Reductions Rule would have no economic effect on any large or small business
entities.

D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information collection requirements in this rule have been approved by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction
Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq., and has been assigned the OMB control no. 2060&hyph;0276. An Information Collection Request
(ICR) document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1650.01), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information
Policy Branch (PM&hyph;223Y), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460, or
by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information is estimated to have a public reporting burden averaging 554 hours per respondent
for one-time burden items and 43 hours per respondent annually for recurring burden items. This includes time for
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing
and reviewing the collection of information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2136); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M Street, SW, Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''

as the post-reduction year. For most sources, the post-reduction year would begin with the date of proposal of the
first section 112(d) standard applicable to the early reductions source; however, for sources that have made enforceable
commitments, it would be the year from January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994.

shall notify the permitting authority of any change made to the source during calendar year 1994 which affects such
control measure information and shall mail the notice within 5 days (postmark date) of making the change. The notice

(a) The regulations in this subpart provide for a limited, Federal, title V, permit program to establish alternative
emission limitations for early reductions sources that have demonstrated qualifying reductions of hazardous air
pollutants under section 112(i)(5) of the Act. A permit issued under this subpart which establishes such an enforceable
alternative emission limitation shall grant all emissions units in the early reductions source a six-year extension
from otherwise applicable dates of compliance for standards promulgated under section 112(d) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After approval of a State's comprehensive permit program pursuant to title V of the Act, the Administrator may
continue to issue specialty permits under this subpart only under the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The early reductions source filed a permit application under this subpart before the State obtained approval
of a comprehensive title V permit program but the permit had not been finally issued at the time of State program approval;

before a comprehensive permit application is required by the State under the approved program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When a circumstance described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section occurs, the primary consideration
in the Administrator's decision to issue a specialty permit is the degree of delay anticipated by deferring to the
State for permit issuance.

(i) Submittal of reports of all required monitoring at least every 6 months. All instances of deviations from permit
requirements must be clearly identified in such reports; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Prompt reporting of any deviations from permit requirements, including those attributable to upset conditions
as defined in the permit. Such reports shall include the probable cause of such deviations and any corrective actions
or preventive measures taken. The Administrator will define ``prompt'' in the permit for each situation and will
do so in relation to the degree and type of deviation likely to occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) A severability clause to ensure the continued validity of the various permit requirements in the event of a challenge
to any portions of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Provisions stating the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The permittee must comply with all conditions of part 71 permit issued under this subpart. A violation of an alternative
emission limitation, as well as any other requirement established in a permit issued under this subpart, is enforceable
pursuant to the authority of section 113 of the Act, notwithstanding any demonstration of continuing 90 percent (95
percent in the case of hazardous air pollutants which are particulates) emission reduction over the entire early
reductions source. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the Act and is grounds for enforcement action
or for permit termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a defense for a permittee in an enforcement action
that it would have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the
conditions of this permit;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The permit may be revised, revoked, reopened, and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request
by the permittee for a permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or of a notification of planned
changes or anticipated noncompliance does not stay any permit condition;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any exclusive privilege; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The permittee shall furnish to the Administrator, within a reasonable time, any information that the Administrator
may request in writing to determine whether cause exists for revising the permit, revoking and reissuing, or terminating
the permit or to determine compliance with the permit. Upon request, the permittee shall also furnish to the Administrator
copies of records required to be kept by the permitee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Terms and conditions for reasonably anticipated operating scenarios identified by the early reductions source
in its application as approved by the Administrator. Such terms and conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Shall require the early reductions source, contemporaneously with making a change from one operating scenario
to another, to record in a log at the permitted facility a record of the scenario under which it is operating. Provided
that an emitting unit is monitored in a way that provides contemporaneous identification that a change to a particular
alternate scenario has occurred, no notice to the Administrator is required. Otherwise, when such a change is made,
the permittee at the beginning of the following week shall place in regular mail to the Administrator notice that a
change to a particular alternate operating scenario has occurred; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Must ensure that the terms and conditions of each such alternative scenario meet the alternative emission limitation
and the requirements of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Terms and conditions, if the permit applicant requests them, for the trading of hazardous air pollutant emissions
increases and decreases among emissions units within the early reductions source without permit revision or case-by-case
approval of each emissions trade, provided that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Such terms and conditions include all terms required under paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section to determine
compliance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions do not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The changes in hazardous air pollutant emissions are not modifications under any provision of title I of the
Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Administrator determines that the emissions are quantifiable and that replicable procedures or other practical
means exist to enforce the emission trades; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The early reductions source owner or operator provides the Administrator written notification at least 7 days
in advance of the proposed changes and includes in the notification a description of the change in emissions that will
occur, when the change will occur, and how the increases and decreases in emissions will comply with the alternative
emission limitation and other terms and conditions of the permit.

Permit shield. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Administrator will expressly include in a permit issued pursuant to this subpart a provision stating that
compliance with the conditions of the permit shall be deemed compliance with part 63, subpart D, of this chapter (the
Early Reductions Rule), as of the date of permit issuance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A permit shield may be extended to all permit terms and conditions for alternate operating scenarios pursuant
to paragraph (a)(9) of this section or that allow increases and decreases in hazardous air pollutant emissions pursuant
to paragraph (a)(10) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nothing in this paragraph (d) or in any permit issued pursuant to this subpart shall alter or affect the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The provisions of sections 112(r) and 303 of the Act (emergency orders);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The liability of an owner or operator of an early reductions source for any violation of applicable requirements
prior to or at the time of permit issuance; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The ability of the Administrator to obtain information from an early reductions source pursuant to section
114 of the Act.

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An ``emergency'' means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control
of the early reductions source, including acts of God, which situation requires immediate corrective action to restore
normal operation, and that causes the early reductions source to exceed an emission limitation under the permit,
due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance
to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of preventative maintenance, careless or improper operation,
or operator error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effect of an emergency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An emergency constitutes an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such an emission limitation
if the conditions of paragraph (e)(3) of this section are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The affirmative defense of emergency shall be demonstrated through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) An emergency occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the emergency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) During the period of the emergency the permittee took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that
exceeded the emission limitation, or other requirements in the permit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The permittee submitted notice of the emergency to the Administrator within 2 working days of the time when emission
limitations were exceeded due to the emergency. This notice fulfills the requirement of paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of
this section. This notice must contain a description of the emergency, any steps taken to mitigate emissions, and
corrective actions taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking to establish the occurrence of an emergency has the burden
of proof.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The Administrator has received a complete application for a permit or permit revision; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The requirements for public participation under &sect;71.27 have been followed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The conditions of the proposed permit or permit revision meet all the requirements of &sect;71.25 and provide
for compliance with an alternative emission limitation reflecting the emissions reduction which qualified the
early reductions source for a compliance extension under part 63, subpart D, of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator will take final action on each permit application (including a request for permit revision)
within 12 months after receiving a complete application, except that final action may be delayed where an applicant
fails to provide additional information in a timely manner as requested by the Administrator under &sect;71.24(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Administrator will promptly provide notice to the applicant of whether the application is complete. Unless
the Administrator requests additional information or otherwise notifies the applicant of incompleteness within
45 days of receipt of an application, the application shall be deemed complete. For revisions that qualify as administrative
amendments and are processed through the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section, a completeness determination
need not be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If a source submits a timely and complete application for permit issuance, the source's failure to have a title
V permit for purposes of any requirements under section 112 pertaining to the early reductions source is not a violation
of this part until the Administrator takes final action on the permit application. This protection shall cease to
apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination made pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and as
required by &sect;71.24(d), the applicant fails to submit by the deadline specified in writing by the Administrator
any additional information identified as being needed to process the application.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permit renewal and expiration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Permits issued under this subpart shall not be renewed. Permit renewal for expiring permits issued under this
subpart shall be accomplished according to the requirements of title V of the Act for comprehensive permits for the
facility containing the early reductions source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, permit expiration terminates the early reductions source's
right to operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If, consistent with the requirements of title V of the Act, a timely and complete application for a comprehensive
title V permit for the facility containing the early reductions source has been submitted but the permitting authority
has failed to issue or deny the comprehensive permit prior to expiration of a permit issued under this subpart, then
the existing permit for the early reductions source shall not expire until the comprehensive title V permit for the
facility has been issued or denied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative permit amendments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An ``administrative permit amendment'' is a permit revision that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Corrects typographical errors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Identifies a change in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the permit, or provides a
similar minor administrative change at the source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Requires more frequent monitoring or reporting by the permittee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Allows for a change in ownership or operational control of an early reductions source where the permitting authority
determines that no other change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement containing a specific
date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and liability between the current and new permittee has been
submitted to the permitting authority; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Incorporates any other type of change which the Administrator has determined to be ministerial in nature and,
therefore, similar to those in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative permit amendment procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative permit amendments may be made to a permit issued under this subpart using the following procedures:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The source shall submit to the Administrator an application containing a proposed addendum to the source's permit.
The application shall demonstrate how the proposed change meets one of the criteria for administrative amendments
set forth in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section, and include certification by the responsible
official consistent with &sect;71.24(f) that the change is eligible for administrative amendment procedures.
The addendum shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Identify the terms of the part 71, subpart B permit the source proposes to change; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Propose new permit terms consistent with the provisions of this subpart applicable to the change; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Designate the addendum as having been processed under the procedures of this paragraph (c); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Specify that the addendum will be effective 60 days from the date of the Administrator's receipt, unless the Administrator
disapproves the change within such period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Administrator will allow the source to implement the requested change immediately upon making all required
submittals, including the proposed addendum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The proposed addendum will become effective 60 days after the Administrator receives the submittal, provided
the Administrator has not disapproved the request in writing before the end of the 60-day period. The Administrator
shall record the change by attaching a copy of the addendum to the part 71, subpart B permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the Administrator disapproves the change, he or she shall notify the source of the reasons for the disapproval
in a timely manner. Upon receiving such notice, the source shall comply with the terms of the permit that it had proposed
to change, and thereafter the proposed addendum shall not take effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The process in this paragraph (c) may also be used for changes initiated by the Administrator that meet the criteria
under paragraphs (c)(1) (i), (ii), and (iv) of this section. For such changes, the Administrator will notify the source
of the proposed change and its effective date, and shall attach a copy of the change to the existing permit. On the effective
date of the proposed change, the source shall comply with the provisions of the proposed change.

Criteria.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Permit revision procedures shall be used for applications requesting permit revisions that do not qualify as administrative
amendments. Nothing in this paragraph (d) shall be construed to preclude the permittee from making changes consistent
with this subpart that would render existing permit compliance terms and conditions irrelevant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Permit revisions shall meet all requirements of this subpart, including those for applications, public participation,
and review by affected States, as they apply to permit issuance. The Administrator will complete review on permit
revisions within 9 months after receipt of a complete application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reopening for cause. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Each issued permit shall include provisions specifying the conditions under which the permit will be reopened.
A permit shall be reopened and revised under any of the following circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The Administrator determines that the permit contains a material mistake or that inaccurate statements were
made in establishing the emission limits or other terms or conditions of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Administrator determines that the permit must be revised to assure compliance with the alternative emission
limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proceedings to reopen and issue a permit shall follow the same procedures as apply to initial permit issuance and
shall affect only those parts of the permit for which cause to reopen exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Reopenings under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not be initiated before a notice of such intent is provided
to the early reductions source by the Administrator. Such notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of the
date that the permit is to be reopened, except that the Administrator may provide a shorter time period in the case of
an emergency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EPA review under State programs for issuing specialty permits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If the Administrator approves a State program for the implementation of this subpart, the State program shall
require that the Administrator receive a copy of each permit application (including any application for permit revision)
each proposed permit, and each final permit issued pursuant to this subpart. The State program may require that the
applicant provide a copy of any permit application directly to the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Administrator will object to the issuance of any proposed permit determined by the Administrator not to be
in compliance with requirements under this subpart or part 63 of this chapter. If the Administrator objects in writing
within 45 days of receipt of a proposed permit and all necessary supporting documentation, the State shall not issue
the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any EPA objection to a proposed permit will include a statement of the Administrator's reasons for objection and
a description of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to respond to the objections. The Administrator
will provide the permit applicant a copy of the objection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Failure of the State to do any of the following also shall constitute grounds for an objection: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Comply with paragraph (f)(1) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Submit any information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Process the permit under procedures approved to meet paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the State fails, within 90 days after the date of an objection under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, to revise
and submit a proposed permit in response to the objection, the Administrator will issue or deny the permit in accordance
with the requirements of this subpart. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public petitions to the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within 60 days after expiration of the Administrator's 45-day review period, any person may petition the Administrator
in writing to make an objection. Any such petition shall be based only on objections to the permit that were raised with
reasonable specificity during the public comment period provided for and consistent with &sect;71.27, unless the
petitioner demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period, or unless the grounds
for such objection arose after such period. If the Administrator objects to the permit as a result of a petition filed
under this paragraph, the permitting authority shall not issue the permit until EPA's objection has been resolved,
except that a petition for review does not stay the effectiveness of a permit or its requirements if the permit was issued
after the end of the 45-day review period and prior to an objection. If the permitting authority has issued a permit
prior to receipt of an EPA objection under this paragraph, the Administrator will revise, terminate, or revoke such
permit, and shall do so consistent with the procedures in 40 CFR 70.7(g)(4) or (g)(5)(i) except in unusual circumstances,
and the permitting authority may thereafter issue only a revised permit that satisfies EPA's objection. In any case,
the source will not be in violation of the requirement to have submitted a timely and complete application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Permits may be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated either at the request of any interested person (including
the permittee) or upon the Administrator's initiative. However, permits may only be revised, revoked and reissued,
or terminated for the reasons specified in &sect;&sect;71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e). All requests shall be in writing
and shall contain facts or reasons supporting the request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) If the Administrator decides the request is not justified, he or she shall send the requester a brief written response
giving a reason for the decision. Denials of requests for revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination are
not subject to public notice, comment, or hearings. Denials by the Administrator may be informally appealed to the
Environmental Appeals Board by a letter briefly setting forth the relevant facts. The Board may direct the Administrator
to begin revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination proceedings under paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
The appeal shall be considered denied if the Board takes no action within 60 days after receiving it. This informal
appeal is, under 42 U.S.C. 307, a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of EPA action in denying a request for revision,
revocation and reissuance, or termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (i) Except in the case of administrative amendment of a permit, if the Administrator tentatively decides to revise
or revoke and reissue a permit under &sect;&sect;71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e), he or she shall prepare a draft permit
under paragraph (b) of this section incorporating the proposed changes. The Administrator may request additional
information and, in the case of a revised permit, shall require the submission of an updated application. In the case
of revoked and reissued permits, the Administrator shall require the submission of a new application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In a permit revision under this subsection, only those conditions to be revised shall be reopened when a new draft
permit is prepared. All other aspects of the existing permit shall remain in effect for the duration of the unrevised
permit. When a permit is revoked and reissued under this subsection, the entire permit is reopened just as if the permit
had expired and was being reissued. During any revocation and reissuance proceeding the permittee shall comply with
all conditions of the existing permit until a new final permit is reissued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Administrator tentatively decides to terminate a permit under &sect;&sect;71.25(a)(7) and 71.26(e),
he or she shall issue a notice of intent to terminate. A notice of intent to terminate is a type of draft permit which follows
the same procedures as any draft permit prepared under paragraph (b) of this section. A notice of intent to terminate
shall not be issued if the Administrator and the permittee agree to termination in the course of transferring permit
responsibility to an approved State under &sect;71.21(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any request by the permittee for revision to an existing permit shall be treated as a permit application and shall
be processed in accordance with all requirements of &sect;71.24.

Draft permits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Once an application is complete, the Administrator shall tentatively decide whether to prepare a draft permit
or to deny the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the Administrator tentatively decides to deny the permit application, he or she shall issue a notice of intent
to deny. A notice of intent to deny the permit application is a type of draft permit which follows the same procedures
as any draft permit prepared under this subsection. If the Administrator's final decision is that the tentative decision
to deny the permit application was incorrect, he or she shall withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare
a draft permit under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the Administrator decides to prepare a draft permit, he or she shall prepare a draft permit that contains the
permit conditions under &sect;71.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All draft permits prepared under this subsection shall be publicly noticed and made available for public comment.
The Administrator shall give notice of opportunity for a public hearing, issue a final decision and respond to comments.
For all early reductions permits, an appeal may be taken under paragraph (l) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statement of basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Administrator shall prepare a statement of basis for every draft permit. The statement of basis shall briefly
describe the derivation of the conditions of the draft permit and the reasons for them or, in the case of notices of intent
to deny or terminate, reasons supporting the tentative decision. The statement of basis shall be sent to the applicant
and, on request, to any other person.

(ii) No public notice is required in the case of administrative permit amendments, or when a request for permit revision,
revocation and reissuance, or termination has been denied under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Written notice
of that denial shall be given to the requester and to the permittee.

All persons, including applicants, who believe any condition of a draft permit is inappropriate or that the Administrator's
tentative decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must raise
all reasonably ascertainable issues and submit all reasonably ascertainable arguments supporting their position
by the close of the public comment period (including any public hearing). Any supporting materials which are submitted
shall be included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless they are already part of the administrative
record in the same proceeding, or consist of State or Federal statutes and regulations, EPA documents of general applicability,
or other generally available reference materials. Commenters shall make supporting materials not already included
in the administrative record available to EPA as directed by the Administrator. (A comment period longer than 30 days
may be necessary to give commenters a reasonable opportunity to comply with the requirements of this paragraph (g).

decision to deny an application, terminate a permit, or prepare a draft permit is inappropriate, must submit all reasonably
available factual grounds supporting their position, including all supporting material, by a date, not less than
60 days after public notice under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section, set by the Administrator. Thereafter, any
person may file a written response to the material filed by any other person, by a date, not less than 20 days after the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) On his or her own motion or on the request of any person, the Administrator may direct that the requirements of
paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section shall apply during the initial comment period where it reasonably appears that
issuance of the permit will be contested and that applying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section
will substantially expedite the decisionmaking process. The notice of the draft permit shall state whenever this
has been done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If any data, information, or arguments submitted during the public comment period appear to raise substantial
new questions concerning a permit, the Administrator may take one or more of the following actions:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prepare a new draft permit, appropriately modified; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or arguments submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

response shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

comment period, EPA may document its response to those matters by adding new materials to the administrative record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The response to comments shall be available to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The 30-day period within which a person may request review under this subsection begins with the service of notice
of the Administrator's action unless a later date is specified in that notice. The petition shall include a statement
of the reasons supporting that review, including a demonstration that any issues raised were raised during the public
comment period (including any public hearing) to the extent required by these regulations unless the petitioner
demonstrates that it was impracticable to raise such objections within such period or unless the grounds for such
objection arose after such period, and, when appropriate, a showing that the condition in question is based on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A finding of fact or conclusion of law which is clearly erroneous; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) An exercise of discretion or an important policy consideration which the Environmental Appeals Board should,
in its discretion, review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Board may also decide on its initiative to review any condition of any permit issued under this subpart. The
Board must act under this paragraph within 30 days of the service date of notice of the Administrator's action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Within a reasonable time following the filing of the petition for review, the Board shall issue an order either
granting or denying the petition for review. To the extent review is denied, the conditions of the final permit decision
become final agency action. Public notice of any grant of review by the Board under paragraph (l) (1) or (2) of this section
shall be given as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Public notice shall set forth a briefing schedule for the
appeal and shall state that any interested person may file an amicus brief. Notice of denial of review shall be sent
only to applicant and to the person(s) requesting review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A petition to the Board under paragraph (l)(1) of this section is, under 42 U.S.C. 307(b), a prerequisite to the
seeking of judicial review of the final agency action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) For purposes of judicial review, final agency action occurs when a final permit is issued or denied by EPA and agency
review procedures are exhausted. A final permit decision shall be issued by the Administrator: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the Board issues notice to the parties that review has been denied; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the Board issues a decision on the merits of the appeal and the decision does not include a remand of the proceedings;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Upon the completion of remand proceedings if the proceedings are remanded, unless the Board's remand order
specifically provides that appeal of the remand decision will be required to exhaust administrative remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Neither the filing of a petition for review of any condition of the permit or permit decision nor the granting of

 This final rule modifies or establishes administrative review procedures for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled
in health maintenance organizations (HMOs), competitive medical plans (CMPs), and health care prepayment plans
(HCPPs). Specifically, it requires that an HMO or CMP complete a reconsideration, requested by a Medicare enrollee
for denied services or claims, within 60 days from the date of receipt of the reconsideration request; extends to HMO
and CMP enrollees the right to request immediate review by a Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization
of an HMO's, CMP's, or hospital's determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary; and requires
an HCPP to establish administrative review procedures for its Medicare enrollees who are dissatisfied with decisions
on denied services or claims.

I. General Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Payment for services provided to Medicare beneficiaries under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) is
generally made on a fee-for-service basis or on a prepayment basis. This rule deals with Medicare services provided
to beneficiaries by entities paid on a prepayment basis. We refer to these entities collectively as ``prepaid health
care organizations.'' Under the prepayment method, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), competitive medical
plans (CMPs), and health care prepayment plans (HCPPs), enter into contracts or agreements with us to provide a range
of services to Medicare beneficiaries who voluntarily enroll in these plans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1876 of the Act provides the authority for us to enter into contracts with HMOs and CMPs to furnish Medicare
covered services to beneficiaries and specifies the requirements these organizations must meet. Contracting HMOs
and CMPs may be paid on either (1) a risk basis, under which they are paid a prospectively determined per capita monthly
payment, or (2) a cost basis under which interim per capita payments are made on the basis of a budget and a retrospective
cost settlement occurs to reflect the reasonable costs actually incurred by the HMO or CMP for the covered services
it furnishes to enrolled members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1833 of the Act provides the basis for regulations under which we enter into written agreements with HCPPs
to furnish or arrange to have furnished covered Medicare Part B services to a defined population on a prepayment basis.

II. Additional Background and Provisions of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 7, 1992, we published a proposed rule (57 FR 46119) in which we proposed to amend the Medicare regulations
governing administrative review rights and procedures for Medicare enrollees in prepaid health care organizations
to: (1) Impose a 60-calendar-day limit for an HMO or CMP to complete a reconsideration requested by a Medicare enrollee
(or authorized representative) for denied services or claims; (2) permit an HMO or CMP enrollee (or authorized representative)
to request immediate Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) review of an HMO, CMP, or hospital
notice of a determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary; and (3) require HCPPs to establish
administrative review procedures for Medicare enrollees similar to those that we require HMOs and CMPs to establish
for Medicare enrollees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Time Limit on Reconsiderations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1876(c)(5)(A) of the Act requires a contracting HMO or CMP to establish procedures for hearing and resolving
grievances between the organization and its Medicare enrollees. Section 1876(c)(5)(B) provides specific administrative
and judicial review rights to Medicare enrollees who are dissatisfied with determinations by the HMO or CMP regarding
services and claims. These rights are similar to those available to beneficiaries in the fee-for-service system,
except that, under the existing regulations at 42 CFR 417.614 and 417.620, the initial level of review is by the HMO
or CMP rather than by a PRO, intermediary, or carrier. Issues that are subject to the full scope of administrative and
judicial review are those in which beneficiaries believe they: (l) Have been denied access to a service to which they
are entitled, or (2) are required to pay an amount that is the responsibility of the HMO or CMP. (Other issues are only
subject to the HMO's or CMP's internal grievance procedures.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at &sect;&sect;417.600 through 417.638 describe the administrative and judicial review process.
Under the first step of the process, the rules provide that the HMO or CMP must make a timely determination and notify
the beneficiary of the reasons for the determination. A determination regarding a request for payment must be made
within 60 days of receiving the claim. If the decision is unfavorable (in whole or in part), the beneficiary (or his
or her authorized representative) may request that the HMO or CMP reconsider the decision. (The beneficiary must
request reconsideration before proceeding to the next step in the review process.) An organization may issue a reconsidered
determination on a case only if the reconsidered determination is entirely favorable to the beneficiary. If the organization
reaffirms its denial of payment or services, in whole or in part, the organization may not issue a reconsidered decision
to the beneficiary. Instead, the organization must prepare a written explanation and refer the case to us, along with
a justification for its initial denial, so that we may make a new and independent determination concerning coverage
of the services at issue. This step is considered part of the reconsideration process. If our reconsideration determination
is not fully favorable to the beneficiary, the beneficiary has a right to request a hearing before an administrative
law judge (ALJ) of the Social Security Administration if the amount remaining in controversy is $100 or more. If the
ALJ hearing does not result in a fully favorable determination, the beneficiary may request Appeals Council review
of the ALJ decision. Following the administrative review process, the beneficiary is entitled to judicial review
of the final determination if the amount remaining in controversy is $1,000 or more. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations do not establish time limits for an HMO or CMP to complete a reconsideration. A beneficiary may
not proceed to the next level of administrative review, however, until the HMO or CMP issues its decision or refers
the matter to us. Therefore, we proposed to amend &sect;417.620 (``Responsibility for reconsideration; time limits'')
to require the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That an HMO or CMP act on the beneficiary's reconsideration request within 60 calendar days from the date of
receipt of the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;That, if the decision made by the organization is entirely favorable to the beneficiary, the organization
so notify the beneficiary within the 60-calendar-day period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;That, if the organization cannot make a decision that is fully favorable to the beneficiary, the organization
must submit the case file to us (or our designated agent) within the 60-calendar-day period described above.

B. PRO Review of Decisions for Hospital Discharges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1154(e) of the Act, as amended by section 9351 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (Public Law
99&hyph;509), provides Medicare beneficiaries with the right to an immediate review by a PRO and, in some cases, certain
financial protections when a hospital, with the concurrence of the attending physician, determines that the beneficiary
no longer requires inpatient hospital care. To exercise the immediate review right, after receiving the hospital's
notice of noncoverage, the beneficiary must request (by telephone or in writing) that the PRO review the validity
of the hospital's decision. The beneficiary must make the request by noon of the first working day after receipt of
the notice. The PRO then must determine within 1 full working day of the request (and receipt of pertinent information
and/or records from the hospital) the appropriateness of the hospital's decision that the beneficiary no longer
requires inpatient hospital care. The hospital cannot charge the beneficiary for the cost of additional hospital
days until noon of the day after receipt of the PRO's determination that the hospital's decision was correct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under current law, if the hospital (rather than the HMO or CMP) sends the discharge notice, the beneficiary is entitled
to request immediate review by a PRO whether or not he or she is enrolled in an HMO or CMP. However, while a beneficiary
enrolled in an HMO or CMP may be protected from being charged by the hospital, he or she is not necessarily protected
from potential financial liability. If the PRO upholds the hospital's notice of noncoverage, there is no regulation
prohibiting the HMO or CMP from billing the beneficiary for the extra days of care while the PRO is reviewing the case
if the extra days result in additional costs to the HMO or CMP. (Depending on the payment arrangement with the hospital,
it is possible that the HMO or CMP will not incur any additional costs by virtue of the patient's additional days in the
hospital. For example, if there is no contract between the HMO and the hospital, the hospital may not charge more than
the amount Medicare would pay. Under the prospective payment system (PPS), that amount remains the same regardless
of the length of the hospital stay, unless outlier payment is involved, that is, additional payment for covered services
for extended length-of-stay cases. Similarly, a contract between an HMO and a hospital might provide that the hospital
is paid on a basis similar to PPS, rather than on a per diem basis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the HMO or CMP, rather than the hospital, makes the determination of noncoverage, the current regulations do not
specifically afford an immediate PRO review right to the enrollees. Therefore, we proposed to amend &sect;417.440
(``Entitlement to health care services from an HMO or CMP''), &sect;417.454 (``Charges to Medicare enrollees''),
and &sect;417.604 (``General Provisions'') and add a new &sect;417.605 (``Immediate PRO review of a determination
of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care'') to provide the Medicare HMO or CMP enrollee with the same administrative
review rights and financial protection as are available to beneficiaries under the fee-for-service system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to require that an HMO or CMP that has not delegated the discharge decision to the hospital and attending
physician: (l) Have the concurrence of the attending physician before making a determination that an enrollee no
longer needs inpatient hospital care; and (2) give the beneficiary a written notice of noncoverage that specifies
the effective date of his or her liability, states why the HMO or CMP believes he or she no longer requires a hospital
level of care, and explains immediate review procedures.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed to revise the beneficiary administrative review procedures to offer an immediate review by the PRO with
which the hospital has an agreement under &sect;466.78. We proposed to adopt the same timeframes for immediate PRO
reviews for HMO and CMP enrollees that are applicable to fee-for-service beneficiaries. Upon receiving a written
notice from the HMO or CMP or a hospital of a determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary, the
enrollee (or authorized representative) would have until noon of the first working day after receipt of the notice
to file (by telephone or in writing) a request for immediate PRO review. The PRO would notify the HMO or CMP that an appeal
has been filed and require the HMO or CMP to provide any pertinent records or information by close of business of the
first working day immediately following the day the beneficiary made the appeal. Further, in response to a request
from the HMO or CMP, the hospital would be required to submit medical records and other pertinent information to the
PRO by close of business of the first full working day immediately following the day the HMO or CMP makes its request.
The PRO would also solicit the views of the enrollee who requested immediate PRO review (or the enrollee's authorized
representative). The PRO would have 1 working day after receipt of the information from the HMO or CMP to make a determination.
The HMO or CMP would be financially liable for the costs of the hospital stay until noon of the calendar day following
receipt of the PRO determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we also proposed to prohibit the HMO or CMP from billing the Medicare beneficiary for the added cost of
hospital days during the immediate review process. An enrollee who requests immediate PRO review would not be entitled
to any subsequent review, under the HMO's or CMP's administrative review process, of the issue of whether hospitalization
was still needed. However, the PRO determination would be subject to appeal under the administrative and judicial
review process set forth in 42 CFR part 473 (that is, PRO reconsiderations and hearings and judicial review of PRO reconsiderations).
As under the current fee-for-service system, the beneficiary who requests that a PRO reconsider its determination
would not be protected from financial liability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, the hospital would not be required to be a concurring party in a discharge decision if the HMO
or CMP issues the notice of noncoverage. However, the hospital could submit the request to the PRO for immediate review
on behalf of the HMO or CMP enrollee. We proposed to clarify that, with one exception, the HMO or CMP is financially responsible
for the costs of the hospital stay until noon of the calendar day following the day the PRO notifies the enrollee of its
review determination. Under the exception, a hospital may not charge the HMO or CMP (or the beneficiary) for the costs
of the continued hospital stay during the PRO review process if the hospital files the request for immediate PRO review
on behalf of a beneficiary and the PRO upholds the noncoverage determination made by the HMO or CMP.

C. Providing Administrative Review Rights to HCPP Members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1833(a)(l)(A) of the Act provides that an organization that furnishes services on a prepayment basis may
elect to receive payment for Part B services on a reasonable cost basis rather than a reasonable charge basis. There
is no indication that the Congress intended to deny Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these organizations (referred
to in these regulations as health care prepayment plans (HCPPs)) their full administrative review rights under section
1869 of the Act because they receive services through an organization that chooses this alternate payment option.
The regulations at 42 CFR part 417, subpart D, applicable to HCPPs, do not, however, specifically address administrative
review rights for Medicare enrollees of HCPPs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fact that existing regulations do not specifically provide for administrative review of HCPP decisions is an
oversight we proposed to correct by amending &sect;417.801 (``Agreements between HCFA and health care prepayment
plans'') and adding new &sect;&sect;417.830 through 417.840 to establish administrative review procedures for
Medicare enrollees of HCPPs who are dissatisfied with denied services or claims. We proposed to adopt under these
sections administrative review procedures for HCPP enrollees that are the same as those for HMO and CMP enrollees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also proposed to make several clarifying technical changes to the regulations relating to administrative reviews
for HMO or CMP enrollees: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Subpart Q, &sect;&sect;417.600, 417.604, 417.606, 417.608, 417.610, 417.612, 417.614, 417.616, 416.618,
416.620, 417.622, and 417.638_We proposed to change the term ``initial determination'' to ``organization determination''
to distinguish between a determination made by the HMO or CMP and one made by us. We also proposed to delete references
to carriers and intermediaries making determinations on behalf of HMOs and CMPs. Carriers and intermediaries now
make only fee-for-service determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Sections 417.604 and 417.610_We proposed to revise &sect;417.604(a)(4) to clarify that physicians and other
individuals who furnish items or services under arrangements with an organization do not have a right to appeal under
the regulations. We proposed to make a conforming change to &sect;417.610(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 417.614_We proposed to clarify the language by making a distinction between an original determination
and a revised or reopened determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 417.630_We proposed to clarify that the reference to the ``amount in controversy'' as a condition
for a party to request a hearing is the amount ``remaining'' in controversy, not the amount of the total bill. We also
proposed to add a phrase to clarify that if beneficiaries combine bills to meet the amount in controversy requirements,
they can use both Part A and Part B bills.

While many of the commenters supported the proposed time limit for issuing reconsideration determinations, two
commenters expressed concern about the initial organization determination. The concern is that HMOs and CMPs deny
(or delay) referrals and other services without providing a written notice and, because there is no record of a denial
or a decision date, it is unclear whether and when a request for reconsideration may be filed. One commenter proposed
that written notices be given for all services granted or denied.

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations at &sect;417.608(c) state that failure by an HMO or CMP to make timely notification of an adverse organization
determination constitutes an adverse determination and may be appealed. In addition, no provision of &sect;417.616
(``Request for reconsideration'') prevents or impedes a Medicare enrollee from filing a request for reconsideration
if the HMO or CMP failed to provide the enrollee with written notice that a service is denied. Thus, if a Medicare enrollee
maintains that he or she is being denied a covered service but is unable to obtain an explicit denial, we believe that
the regulations permit the enrollee to move to the next step of the appeals process and file a request for reconsideration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written notices for all decisions to grant or deny services, as proposed by the commenter, would require an inestimable
amount of additional paperwork, with marginal benefit. This requirement would also eliminate the current flexibility
of the regulations which allows enrollees to file for a reconsideration without a written denial.

Two commenters expressed concern that the Medicare appeals process does not recognize the need for expedited determinations
in time-sensitive medical situations. One commenter proposed incorporation of an expedited appeals process for
denied services, depending on the relative urgency of the perceived need for the service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We recognize that there are medical situations in which outcomes are greatly affected by the promptness of treatment.
We also recognize that our regulations do not specifically address these situations. In order to establish an expedited
process for organization determinations, however, we would need the benefit of proposed rulemaking and public comment.
We will consider the need for regulations in this area in the near future. In the interim, we believe that regulations
at &sect;417.608(c), as noted above, permit the Medicare enrollee some flexibility in assuming a service is denied
and seeking a timely reconsideration. Medicare enrollees also may obtain denied services outside the plan and use
the appeals process to pursue payment, or complain in writing or by telephone to the HCFA regional office for the area.
Complaints to the regional office are not intended to, and usually will not, circumvent the appeals process, but introduce
Federal followup and tracking of HMO/CMP responses in these situations.

Even in the absence of specific regulatory requirements, we expect Medicare contracting HMOs and CMPs to expedite
any initial coverage determination and reconsideration if a delay in the decision, and a subsequent postponement
or suspension of treatment, could have serious, adverse consequences on the health status of the beneficiary (for
example, cause impairment of any bodily function and/or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part).

Two commenters believed that the 60-day time period frequently is not long enough, and that the time limit should apply
only to ``clean cases'' or should begin after all materials are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 60-day limit is consistent with the time period allowed in making the initial organization determination, is
supported as reasonable by most commenters on the proposed rule, and should be adequate in most circumstances. Nonetheless,
while we do not agree with the specific suggestion of the commenters, we are amending &sect;417.620 (Responsibility
for reconsideration; time limits) to allow extensions for ``good cause.'' The ``good cause'' extension authority
will not diminish the new time limit requirement, but will allow for unusual circumstances such as natural disasters
or circumstances that make it difficult or impossible for the enrollee to provide necessary information in a timely
way. This will benefit both the enrollee and the health plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not accept this comment. In order to provide meaningful review of the HMO's/CMP's decision, we (or the independent
reviewer with which we contract) must have the complete record of the dispute. When the HMO/CMP conducts a reconsideration
of its original decision, it presumably has all of the documentation it considered relevant to its initial decision.
However, our experience demonstrates that the independent reviewer must often request that additional material
be submitted. Our current policy allows the HMO time to obtain the additional information. If the information is not
received, the contractor will make its decision based on the record available. Since legitimate delays may occur,
however, we believe it would be to the parties' advantage to have a flexible deadline for the independent review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are, on the other hand, concerned that beneficiaries not suffer undue financial hardship during an appeal. We monitor
the activities of the contractor and the status of reconsiderations as part of our overall monitoring of compliance
with program requirements. Our contract with the independent reviewer also contains a 30-day timeliness standard
for clean claims, as stipulated in

One commenter suggested that the appeals regulations explain the consequences of failure to meet the 60-day time
limit or to issue written determinations. One commenter urged a system of intermediate sanctions for HMOs/CMPs that
fail to make timely organization or reconsideration determinations.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with the commenter that there should be consequences for failure to provide determinations in a timely manner
and within established time standards. As explained in an earlier response to a comment, we believe that the regulations
at &sect;417.608(c) permit a Medicare enrollee to move to the reconsideration process if timely notification of
an adverse organization determination is not made. To ensure that the 60-day limit serves as a time ceiling for this
stage of the appeals process, we are adding a provision to &sect;417.620. This provision clarifies that failure to
complete the reconsideration within the time allowed, or to obtain a ``good cause'' extension from us, constitutes
an adverse determination and the appeals file must be submitted to us. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations were published on July 15, 1994 (59 FR 36072) that allow us to impose intermediate sanctions and civil
money penalties for a number of performance violations on the part of HMOs and CMPs. Though the sanction and penalty
authorities are untested at this time, we will be assessing how information from the appeals process may be used to
improve plan performance or initiate a sanctions process in response to suspected violations such as a substantial
failure to provide required medically necessary services and the failure adversely affects the enrollee.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While many of the commenters supported the proposed provision, several commenters opposed it on several accounts,
including that it would have an adverse economic impact on HMOs/CMPs, that adequate enrollee protections already
exist, and that it would interfere with the patient-physician relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are aware that the right to immediate PRO review may add to the costs of caring for Medicare enrollees. It is difficult
to assess the degree to which this will affect HMOs and CMPs, because many Medicare-contracting plans delegate the
discharge decision to the physician and hospital. In these circumstances, PRO review has already been in effect and
no additional financial impact is anticipated. In addition, some HMOs/CMPs pay hospitals on a diagnosis-related
group basis and hospital payments may not be affected. In circumstances where the HMO/CMP makes the discharge decision
in conjunction with its affiliated physicians and pays the hospital on a per diem basis and thus faces additional hospital
charges, we do not concur with the commenters' position, that is, that the HMO/CMP not be held financially accountable
for the additional hospital days. For risk-contracting HMOs/CMPs, the Medicare payment rate is based on fee-for-service
costs, and the costs of extra hospital days during the PRO review process are incorporated into these calculations.
Therefore, the average cost for hospital inpatient days during the PRO review period in the HMO's/CMP's area are already
included in the adjusted average per capita cost rate. Since all cost-contracting HMOs/CMPs currently choose to
have the hospital seek payment directly from the fiscal intermediary, there should be no additional costs to the health
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While we do not have evidence of early discharge complaints against HMOs and CMPs, it is possible that some Medicare
enrollees are dissatisfied but have no mechanism for expressing it. Moreover, in the interests of due process, we
believe it is important to provide beneficiaries comparable rights whether they do or do not enroll in an HMO/CMP,
and whether or not they have the need to take advantage of those rights. Moreover, if there really are no complaints,
then this will not be a burdensome requirement on HMOs and CMPs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, in response to concern about the patient-physician relationship, there has been no problem of this type arising
out of the right to immediate PRO review under the fee-for-service program. Also, HMOs/CMPs, because they coordinate
their enrollees' total health care needs, generally have a strong relationship between their Medicare enrollees
and physicians (as well as other health plan staff). We believe that HMOs/CMPs that maintain positive communications
and relationships with their Medicare enrollees will not experience any difficulty in this area.

One commenter was concerned about frivolous claims and the potential incentives to appeal to the PRO for review. This
commenter suggested that either the Medicare program or the enrollee be responsible for the expense of extra hospital
days if the noncoverage decision is upheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our experience with immediate PRO review of hospital discharge (noncoverage) decisions does not support a concern
about frivolous claims. Relative to the number of discharges under the Medicare fee-for-service program, the number
of appeals to the PRO is extremely small. We expect that HMOs/CMPs, because they are more involved in the health care
of their enrollees, would have a similar experience, and may even experience fewer PRO appeals if they communicate
effectively with their enrollees and have adequate safeguards against premature discharges.

With respect to financial liability for extra hospital days, the adjusted average per capita cost calculation includes
these costs. We would be overpaying if a separate payment was made to plans for these charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will not shift these costs to the Medicare enrollee because fee-for-service beneficiaries are already protected,
and we believe that beneficiaries should be treated similarly whether they choose managed care or fee-for-service.
We do not believe this difference in protections should have to be a factor in the beneficiaries' choice. Further,
we believe that financial responsibility for extra hospital days related to an appeal would be a strong disincentive
to any beneficiary who questions the appropriateness of a discharge decision. Such a requirement would undermine
the intent of an appeals process.

One commenter stated that we mischaracterized the HMO's and CMP's responsibility for discharge decisions in the
preamble of the proposed rule. The commenter stated that the final authority for discharge rests with the physician
and that HMOs/CMPs cannot discharge enrollees from a hospital.

Response:

We agree that the preamble should have referred to ``noncoverage'' decisions by the HMO/CMP rather than ``discharge''
decisions. The right to immediate PRO review affects 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
noncoverage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decisions in cases in which the HMO/CMP and its affiliated physicians agree that a Medicare enrollee no longer requires
hospitalization and the hospital does not make the noncoverage decision. We also believe that the use of the term ``attending
physician'' in proposed &sect;&sect;417.440 (f)(2) and (f)(4) (which require concurrence of a physician in the
discharge decision) does not clearly express the relationship between the HMO/CMP and its affiliated physician
providers. Therefore, in the final rule we have removed the term ``attending physician'' and inserted ``its affiliated
physician responsible for the hospital care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP'' in
its place.

Usually, the HMO/CMP-affiliated physician makes the decision that a Medicare enrollee is ready for discharge. Some
HMOs/CMPs make use of an extended treatment team, such as case managers, discharge coordinators, or utilization
review coordinators, and a member of this team may believe an enrollee is ready for discharge when the physician does
not. In these situations, the health plan's internal procedures will provide guidance for making the discharge decision.
HMO/CMP physicians have legal arrangements or contracts with their health plans, and must abide by the plan's procedures.
We support the HMO/CMP structure for the delivery of health care, and we would not support a policy that undermines
the nature of managed care operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases in which the physician caring for a hospitalized enrollee is not under contract or bound by the terms of an arrangement

We do not agree with the commenter. Under the fee-for-service Medicare program, hospitals have their charts ready
to submit to the PRO at the same time that the notice of noncoverage is given. This, in effect, gives the PRO another working
day to review the medical chart. We believe HMOs/CMPs can adopt the same efficiencies and that it is in the financial
interest of the HMO/CMP to ensure that all records are submitted as soon as possible. In regard to PRO timeliness, the
PROs have an excellent record for completing these reviews in the time allotted and, in many cases, earlier.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters expressed concern about our regulations extending the section 1876 managed care administrative
review requirements to HCPPs and disagreed with our interpretation of the intent of the Congress in this regard. It
was the opinion of both commenters that the Congress should expressly legislate these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted previously, section 1833 of the Act simply permits entities that provide Part B services on a prepayment basis
to be paid reasonable costs rather than reasonable charges. There is no indication that the Congress intended to deprive
enrolled beneficiaries of meaningful appeal rights. Our regulations governing HCPPs were designed to establish
a workable mechanism for reimbursing them, in light of the fact that the way they do business is more comparable to HMOs
and CMPs than it is to physicians, suppliers, and providers who are paid under Part B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As certain aspects of the Medicare program have been improved over the years, such as the addition of beneficiary protections,
we have not revised HCPP regulations to reflect these changes. Recently, we have embarked on an effort to identify
actions that are within our authority, to ensure that the HCPP program is administered prudently and that Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in these plans have rights and benefits comparable to those that beneficiaries have in the
fee-for-service system and in HMOs/CMPs. We believe that we have administrative authority to ensure that these beneficiaries
are given appropriate appeal rights.

by specifying that a determination regarding services that are not covered under the HCPP's agreement with HCFA is
not an organization determination.

 One commenter stated that disputes over the level or manner in which a service is provided, such as model variations
of durable medical equipment, should not be subject to the appeals process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The appeal rights of Medicare enrollees of an HCPP pertain to disputes involving an organization determination.
We believe that &sect;417.838(a), which identifies actions that are organization determinations, responds to
this concern. Section 417.838(a) limits the applicability of the appeals process to a refusal, on the grounds that
the services are not covered by Medicare, to furnish or arrange for services or pay for services furnished to the beneficiary.

 One commenter sought clarification on whether an HCPP's refusal to pay coinsurance on services obtained out-of-plan
(and paid for by the carrier) would be subject to the appeals process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The HCPP's obligation to pay coinsurance amounts, where the plan's Medicare premium covers such amounts, would depend
on the circumstances. If an enrollee is denied a service by the HCPP, then obtains the service out-of-plan, and subsequently
the service is determined to be a covered service and paid for by the carrier under Medicare principles of reimbursement,
the enrollee can request that the health plan pay the coinsurance amount. Then, if the HCPP makes an organization determination
that is adverse to the enrollee, or fails to complete its review in 60 days, the matter would be referred to us for reconsideration.

 One commenter suggested allowing HCPP enrollees to retain existing appeal rights through Medicare carriers if the
HCPP review process proves futile or ineffective.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. One intent of this rule is to ensure that HCPP enrollees have the same appeal rights as other beneficiaries
in Medicare managed care. A back-up system does not exist for other Medicare beneficiaries and cannot be justified
on either a cost or programmatic basis. When this rule takes effect, HCPP performance in operating an effective administrative
review process will be added to our contractor monitoring process.

 One commenter stated that the estimate for additional paperwork burden on HCPPs related to these new requirements
is grossly underestimated.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Health plans that contract with us as HCPPs vary in their administrative systems and capability to adapt to the new
requirements. While we agree that the estimate may underrepresent the additional burden on some health plans, it
may not for others. We attempted to estimate an ``average'' additional workload, given that most HCPPs have a grievance
system for commercial enrollees on which to build an appeals system for Medicare enrollees.

 One commenter stated that they opposed a change to &sect;417.630 (``Right to a hearing'') regarding ``amounts remaining
in controversy'' to qualify for a hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Addition of this phrase is a clarification of existing practice, not a substantive change. Beneficiary appeals made
to Medicare managed care organizations may be denied in full or in part. Once a service or a claim has been covered by
an HMO/CMP, even if the service is only one part of the appeal, &sect;417.604(a)(2) specifies that the service or claim
is no longer subject to appeal. Only those services that continue to be denied may be moved through the process of reconsideration
to hearing.

 One commenter opposed the change in terminology from ``initial determination'' to ``organization determination.''
The commenter is concerned that policy issues may be mislabeled as ``organization issues'' and be misdirected to
the appeals process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The concern of the commenter, we believe, is that communications to an HMO or CMP questioning the plan's coverage policies
will be misinterpreted and directed to the plan's appeal process. We believe that HMOs and CMPs can distinguish between
challenges to the plan's coverage policies, in general, and appeals of coverage decisions for specifically requested
services, if clearly communicated. We do not believe that the commenter's rationale warrants a change from using
the terminology ``organization determination'' as proposed.

 We have considered this suggestion. However, because the commenter is suggesting a significant change that was not
addressed in the proposed rule, we cannot address this issue at this time. The issue of HMO and CMP appeal rights, as
well as other appeals process issues, will be evaluated and considered for development as a separate regulation.

 One commenter questioned allowing HMOs/CMPs to request a reopening of a determination and another commenter recommended
that an HMO/CMP request for a reopening should not delay implementation of the reconsideration determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With regard to the first comment, the regulations impose no limitation on who may request a reopening, although the
decision whether to reopen is discretionary with the decisionmaker. In response to the second comment, &sect;417.626
provides that a reconsidered determination is ``final and binding'' on all parties unless a hearing request is filed,
or the determination ``is revised'' in accordance with a reopening decision. Therefore, if an HMO's or CMP's denial
of a service or claim is overturned upon reconsideration, the plan must abide by the determination unless and until
the termination is overturned as the result of the reopening.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Existing &sect;417.604(c) (``Written description of appeals procedure'') requires HMOs/CMPs to provide enrollees
with written materials on appeal procedures. We believe that this is a better method for ensuring that all enrollees
are informed. Further, this approach makes the information readily available in the enrollee's own home. With regard
to the need for a national communication, we agree that beneficiaries should be made aware of the new appeal rights
and procedures. We will modify the Medicare Handbook and other booklets and pamphlets routinely distributed by us
to incorporate the policies of this final regulation.

 While we disagree that a special education program is needed, we agree that HMOs/CMPs must inform Medicare enrollees
of these new protections. HMOs/CMPs have various means of communicating with enrollees, including written material
(for example, newsletters), and use of these means for informing Medicare beneficiaries of these new appeal rights
is acceptable to us. The requirement at &sect;417.604, discussed above, is adequate for this purpose and another
regulatory requirement is unnecessary. HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs must notify their enrollees of the changes/additions
to the appeal rights and when they are effective.

 We assume that the commenter is referring to &sect;418.801(b)(4). In the amendatory language of the proposed rule,
we stated that ``In &sect;417.801, the introductory language of paragraph (b) is republished, paragraph (b)(4)
is revised, paragraph (b)(5) is redesignated as paragraph (b)(6), and a new paragraph (b)(5) is added to read as follows:''.
That amendatory language contained technical errors. Paragraph (b)(4) was not revised; the language published
in the proposed rule is the same as existing paragraph (b)(4). Additionally, existing paragraph (b)(5) should not
have been redesignated; existing paragraph (b)(6) should have been redesignated as paragraph (b)(7) and a new paragraph
(b)(6) added. These errors have been corrected in the final rule.

IV. Provisions of This Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have adopted the provisions of the October 7, 1992, proposed rule, with the following changes, which have been discussed
above: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;417.440(f) (``Notice of noncoverage of inpatient hospital care''). This
proposed section required that, before giving notice of noncoverage, the HMO or CMP must obtain the concurrence of
the attending physician. We have revised ``attending physician'' to ``its affiliated physician responsible for
the hospital care of the enrollee, or other physician as authorized by the HMO or CMP''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Proposed &sect;417.454 (``Charges to Medicare enrollees'') is revised to restore existing provisions that
were erroneously removed in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised paragraph (c) of proposed &sect;417.620 (``Responsibility for reconsiderations; time limits)
to require that the HMO or CMP issue the reconsidered determination to the enrollee, or submit an explanation and file
to us, within 60 days from the date of receipt of the request for reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;417.838(b) (``Actions that are not organization determinations'') by adding
a new paragraph (3). New paragraph (3) specifies that a determination regarding services that are covered under the
HCPP's agreement with us that the enrollee obtained from unaffiliated providers or physicians, in violation of the
HCPP's enrollment agreement, is not an organization determination for purposes of administrative review procedures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the above changes, in a number of sections, we made a nomenclature change by substituting ``HMO or CMP''
and its plural and possessive forms for the words ``organization'', ``organizations'' and ``organization's'',
respectively. This change was made to use consistent terminology throughout part 417. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also have made technical changes and minor editorial changes that do not affect the substance of the provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Paperwork Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 417.440(f), 417.605, 417.620, and 417.836 of this rule contain additional requirements that are subject
to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
Chapter 35). HMOs and CMPs are required to notify beneficiaries if the HMO or CMP refers a request for reconsideration
to HCFA. We estimate that this reporting burden will be approximately 5 minutes per case. Also, before a hospital discharge,
HMOs and CMPs are required to provide Medicare enrollees with a written notice of a determination that an enrollee's
inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary. We estimate that the reporting burden for an HMO or CMP that has not
delegated the discharge decision to the hospital to provide the written notice of noncoverage to be approximately
10 minutes per notice; for a Medicare enrollee of an HMO or CMP to complete a request for immediate PRO review of a notice
of a determination that an inpatient hospital stay is no longer necessary to be approximately 10 minutes per request;
for the HMO or CMP to submit requested medical information to the PRO, to be approximately 1/2 hour per response. HCPPs
are required to develop appeal procedures and inform Medicare enrollees of appeal rights. We estimate that it will
take an HCPP 40 hours to develop these appeal procedures and 1 hour to process each appeal. A notice will be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

VI. Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), we prepare a regulatory flexibility
analysis unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we consider all HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to be small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule provides the Medicare HMO or CMP enrollee with the same administrative review rights and financial
protections as are available to beneficiaries in the fee-for-service system. To the extent that current Medicare
membership in HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs to which this rule will apply is low (approximately 7 percent of the total Medicare
population), we do not expect any significant increased costs or savings as a result of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the Secretary
certifies, that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
or a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management measures aimed at protecting lives and new
construction from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized
flood insurance is now available for property in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary.

The Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale
of flood insurance.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In this rulemaking proceeding, the Commission completes the initial implementation of sections 3(n) and 332 of the
Communications Act of 1934 (``Communications Act'' or ``Act''), as amended by section 6002(b) of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). As required by Congress, the Commission adopts changes to our technical,
operational, and licensing rules for common carrier and private mobile radio services that are necessary to implement
the statute and to establish regulatory symmetry among similar mobile services. The establishment of this regulatory
framework also sets the stage for the future evolution of mobile services. In this respect, these rules changes mark
an important step in the Commission's continuing effort to enhance competition among mobile services providers,
promote the development of new and technologically innovative service offerings, and ensure that consumer demand,
not regulatory decree, dictates the course of the mobile services marketplace.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 604, a final regulatory flexibility analysis
has been prepared and is presented below. It is available for public viewing as part of the full text of the decision,
which may be obtained from the Commission or its copy contractor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. section 603, an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
(IRFA) was incorporated into the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252. Written comments on the proposals in the Further Notice, including the IRFA, were requested.

A. Need for and Purpose of Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to implement Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended. The policies adopted herein will carry out Congressional intent to establish a consistent regulatory framework
for all commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) providers. Specifically, this Order ensures that CMRS providers
who compete with one another will be subject to comparable technical, operational, and licensing rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Issues Raised by the Public in Response to the Initial Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were submitted specifically in response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in this proceeding offered numerous proposals. The commenters supported the major tenets of the proposed changes,
and some commenters suggested changes to some of the Commission's proposals. The regulatory burdens we have retained
for all CMRS licenses, including small entities, are necessary to carry out our duties under the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended. For example, we have extended section 309 notice and comment procedures to all CMRS applicants.
We also minimized regulatory burdens, where possible, for all CMRS licensees. For example, we adopt a unitary application
form for all mobile services applicants and eliminate most end user eligibility requirements and restrictions on
permissible uses of CMRS systems. In addition, our proposal to impose a cap on the amount of CMRS spectrum that licensees
may aggregate in a given geographic area was discussed by many commenters. We conclude that the spectrum cap as proposed
should not be adopted but, rather, that a more specific cap on aggregation of PCS, cellular and SMR spectrum should
be adopted. A copy of the Report and Order shall be sent to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.

Synopsis of the Third Report and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Last year, in the Budget Act, Congress created the CMRS regulatory classification and mandated that similar commercial
mobile radio services be accorded similar regulatory treatment under the Commission's Rules. The broad goal of this
action is to ensure that economic forces_not disparate regulatory burdens_shape the development of the CMRS marketplace.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Budget Act directs the Commission to take certain steps toward that goal not later than August 9, 1994. These steps
include revising our rules to ensure the services reclassified as CMRS by the Budget Act are ``subjected to technical
[and operational] requirements that are comparable to the technical requirements that apply to licensees that are
providers of substantially similar common carrier services.'' The Commission also must adopt rules for licensing
CMRS, including reclassified services, pursuant to the radio common carrier licensing provisions of the Act. Finally,
the Budget Act mandates that the Commission take appropriate steps to ensure an orderly transition to the new CMRS
regulatory structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 20, 1994, the Commission adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further Notice) 59 FR 28042 (May
31, 1994) to address pending issues relating to the implementation of the statute. In particular, the Commission
sought to address the impact of the amended statute on our technical, operational, and licensing rules for all mobile
services, and particularly on the rules affecting those Part 90 services that were reclassified as CMRS by the CMRS
Second Report and Order, 59 FR 18493 (April 19, 1994). As required by section 6002(d)(3) of the Budget Act, the Commission
proposed to amend these rules to the extent necessary to ensure that competing mobile services would be subject to
comparable regulatory requirements, and that inconsistencies in our regulation of substantially similar services
would be eliminated to the extent practical. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Further Notice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
indicated that the Commission would act on its proposals not later than the August 9, 1994, deadline established by
Congress for adoption of rules implementing the statute. On May 19, 1994, the Commission revised the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Further Notice 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on its own motion to seek comment on the additional issue of whether the amount of spectrum that CMRS licensees may aggregate
in a given geographic area should be limited. The Commission received 61 comments and 70 reply comments in response
to the Further Notice.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this Order the Commission takes four steps to implement both the broad goal of the Budget Act and the more narrowly
focused requirements generated by its August 9, 1994, transition deadline. First, the Order determines which reclassified
services are ``substantially similar'' to existing common carrier services in order to implement the Budget Act
requirement that such services be subject to ``comparable'' regulation. Second, the Order revises part 90 and part
22 technical and operational rules governing those services to ensure that the rules are, indeed, ``comparable.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, to effectuate the broad congressional goal of ensuring that competition shapes the development of the CMRS
market, the Order adopts rules that cap at 45 MHz the total amount of combined broadband personal communications services
(PCS), cellular, and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) spectrum in which an entity may have an attributable interest
in any geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, to carry out Budget Act requirements concerning the licensing of CMRS services, the Order adopts uniform
rules for licensing CMRS services, including reclassified services. The Commission is also modifying its licensing
rules for part 22 CMRS and part 90 commercial services, where appropriate, to adopt filing windows for the filing of
competing initial applications and conclude that competitive bidding procedures should be used to select from among
mutually exclusive applications. Moreover, as the Further Notice tentatively concluded the Commission is taking
the additional step of adopting a single, uniform application form for use by all CMRS and PMRS applicants in all terrestrial
mobile services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summarized in the following section are the principal decisions the Commission is adopting in connection with each
of the four actions taken in this Order. Before doing so, it is important to note that while all the rules adopted in this
Order become effective on January 2, 1995, some of those rules do not apply immediately to the reclassified CMRS entities
that will continue to be treated as private carriers under the grandfathering provisions of the Budget Act. Specifically,
until the grandfathered period ends on August 9, 1996, with regard to existing licensees, such entities will not be
subject to technical, operational, or licensing rule changes made in this Order that apply exclusively to CMRS. Instead,
they will be subject to regulation as private carriers under part 90 of our rules. Grandfathered carriers should note,
however, that they are governed by modifications to rules the Commission makes in this Order that are applicable to
private carriers.

1. Substantially Similar Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order establishes the framework for implementing the mandate of the Budget Act that the Commission revise its
rules to the extent necessary and practical to ensure that providers of reclassified CMRS services are subjected
to technical and operational rules comparable to those that apply to providers of substantially similar common carrier
services. To that end, the Commission's initial task was to identify reclassified CMRS services that are ``substantially
similar'' to common carrier services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goals of the Budget Act serve as the Commission's guidepost for this task: (1) To create a level regulatory playing
field for CMRS; (2) to establish an appropriate level of regulation for the administration of CMRS; (3) to resolve
``substantial similarity'' issues with a view toward ensuring that unwarranted regulatory burdens are not imposed
on reclassified CMRS providers; and (4) to promote the economic goals discussed in the CMRS Second Report and Order,
including fostering economic growth, promoting investment in mobile telecommunications infrastructure, and
enabling access to the national information superhighway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these goals, the Order concludes that the appropriate analytical framework for determining whether services
are substantially similar is to assess whether licensees in those services actually or potentially compete to meet
the needs and demands of consumers. The Order concludes that all reclassified private mobile radio services actually
compete, or have the potential to compete within a reasonable time period, with existing commercial mobile radio
services. In other words, the Commission concludes that all CMRS_including one-way messaging and data, and two-way
voice, messaging, and data_are competing services or have the reasonable potential to become competing services
in the CMRS marketplace. Thus, on the basis of this competitive analysis, the Order finds that all reclassified private
services are substantially similar to existing commercial services, for purposes of section 332 of the Communications
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This broad reading of the term ``substantially similar'' furthers the statutory purposes of promoting uniformity
in CMRS regulation and, thereby, minimizes the potentially distorting effects of asymmetrical regulation. This
reasoning also comports with the Commission's analysis of current and likely future competition in the CMRS marketplace.
Actual competition among certain CMRS services exists already and, more importantly, the potential for competition
among all CMRS services appears likely to increase over time due to expanding consumer demand and technological innovation.
Such conditions argue for defining the class of ``substantially similar'' services expansively, at least for the
limited purpose of establishing baseline technical and operational rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is worth emphasizing the determinative relationship between the forward-looking policy goals embodied in the
rule comparability requirement of the Budget Act and the Commission's assessment of competitive trends in the CMRS
marketplace. Thus, this Order begins with the conclusion that mobile services will be treated as substantially similar
if they compete against each other. Next, the Commission has chosen to take an expansive view of the present condition
of competition among services in the CMRS marketplace, and of the potential for competition among these services
in the future, because such a view maximizes the range of services that can be considered to be substantially similar.
This in turn leads the Commission to conclude that, to the extent practical, technical and operational rules should
be comparable for virtually all existing and reclassified CMRS services. This conclusion furthers the Commission's
policy objective of ensuring a level regulatory playing field for CMRS. The Order notes, however, that an analysis
performed in the context of a different set of policy goals, or application of the same policy goals to different circumstances,
may result in different conclusions regarding the extent of competition.

2. Comparable Technical and Operational Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The determination that actual and potential competition among CMRS services makes them ``substantially similar''
for purposes of Budget Act analysis carries over into the assessment of technical and operational rules. The Order
concludes that differences between rules governing actually or potentially competitive services should be conformed
if the Commission determines that the differences distort competition by placing unequal regulatory burdens on
different classes of CMRS providers. Such conformity between rules will not be imposed, however, if the Commission
determines that, although the relative burdens imposed by the rules may not be identical, the cost of conforming the
rules outweighs the benefit that might be gained thereby. Pursuant to this analytical framework, the principal determinations
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Service Area and Channel Assignment Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
800 MHz SMR: The Order adopts the principle that 800 MHz SMR systems should be licensed on a Major Trading Area (MTA)
basis to the extent feasible, but defers for further comment the specifics of licensing such systems to ensure that
the interests of both existing licensees and potential entrants are taken into account. The Commission will shortly
issue a further notice of proposed rule making in our 800 MHz docket (PR Docket No. 93&hyph;144) regarding: (1) Designating
200 contiguous SMR channels for MTA licensing based on 50-channel blocks; (2) continuing to license the remaining
80 SMR channels under existing rules; and (3) allowing incumbents to continue operating on existing channels. The
Order declines to adopt a proposal by Nextel that certain 800 MHz incumbents be subject to mandatory returning to new
frequencies, but the Commission will seek further comment on this issue. The Order further concludes that both existing
SMR licensees and new entrants will be eligible for MTA licenses, with licensees to be selected by auction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event of mutually exclusive applications. Finally, the Order concludes that in light of the fundamental changes
to be implemented in 800 MHz licensing, the Commission is suspending the acceptance of all new 800 MHz SMR applications,
as of August 9, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
900 MHz SMR: The Order adopts MTA-based licensing of all 200 channels in blocks of 10 channels. The Order concludes
that eligibility for MTA licenses will be open to existing licensees and new entrants, with competitive bidding to
be used in the event of mutually exclusive applications. Incumbent licensees who do not obtain MTA licenses will be
entitled to continue operating under existing authorizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
220 MHz Commercial Service: The Order concludes that service area definitions and channel assignment rules applicable
to licensing of 220 MHz systems should not be changed at this time. The Commission will address such issues in a separate,
future rule making proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Private Carrier Paging: The Order adopts no conformance changes to existing part 90 and part 22 paging rules in this
docket. The Commission will defer further action until it examines the question of wide-area licensing and whether
further conforming of Commission rules is feasible.

b. Other Technical and Operational Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Order concludes that no fundamental changes should be made to existing rules regulating co-channel interference,
adjacent channel interference, or antenna height and transmitter power.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order concludes that all CMRS and PMRS mobiles and portables shall be subject to the 1992 ANSI/IEEE Radio Frequency
(RF) exposure guidelines. The Order further concludes that this decision will be implemented in the proceeding in
which the Commission is conducting a complete review of RF exposure guidelines, ET Docket No. 93&hyph;62.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order concludes that new interoperability requirements will not be adopted for CMRS equipment at this time, but
the Commission will be retaining the existing interoperability rule applicable with regard to cellular service.
The Commission intends to explore the question of interoperability requirements for CMRS equipment in a future inquiry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order adopts a uniform 12-month construction requirement for all CMRS licensees, except in instances in which
the rules specify a longer period for systems of greater size or complexity. The Order eliminates loading requirements
for CMRS, except that incumbent 900 MHz SMR licensees must meet current requirements for retaining channels at renewal.
In addition, the Order adopts rules allowing a multi-station CMRS system to use a single call sign for station identification
purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order eliminates existing user eligibility restrictions that prevent SMR, private carrier paging, Business
Radio, and commercial 2209 MHz licensees from providing service to foreign governments and their representatives.
The Commission also eliminates eligibility restrictions that prevent Business Radio licensees from providing
service to individuals. The Order also eliminates the part 90 restriction on common carrier communications for reclassified
CMRS services. Finally, the Order applies existing Equal Employment Opportunity requirements to all CMRS licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Spectrum Aggregation Limit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Order addresses the issue of imposing a cap on the amount of CMRS spectrum a licensee may aggregate in a given geographic
area as a means of preventing potentially anticompetitive aggregation of CMRS spectrum. The Commission concludes
that to preserve competitive opportunities in the CMRS marketplace, it is unnecessary to establish, in addition
to existing CMRS spectrum aggregations limitations, the broad CMRS spectrum cap proposed in the Further Notice.
Rather, the Order concludes that the Commission's goals will be achieved by capping at 45 MHz the total amount of PCS,
cellular, and SMR spectrum in which an entity may have an attributable interest in any geographic area. The Order adopts
this cap as a minimally intrusive means of ensuring that the mobile communications marketplace remains competitive
and retains incentives for efficiency and innovation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order also reaches the following determinations with regard to implementation of the spectrum cap. First, the
Order concludes that various encumbrances on SMR spectrum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vis-&agrave;-vis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cellular or broadband PCS should be accounted for when measuring SMR spectrum for purposes of the cap. Therefore,
the Commission will attribute to an entity a maximum of 10 MHz of SMR spectrum, including both 800 and 900 MHz spectrum
for purposes of determining compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Order adopts a 20 percent cross ownership attribution rules for licensees other than designated entities.
Thus, when an entity other than a designated entity has a 20 percent or greater ownership interest in an SMR, cellular,
or PCS license in a particular geographic area, the entire amount of spectrum associated with that license will be
attributed to that entity for spectrum cap purposes. For designated entities, the attribution level will be a 40 percent
or greater ownership interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, to compute an SMR spectrum total in a given market, the licensee must identify all attributable 800 MHs and 900
MHz SMR base stations located inside the MTA or BTA. All 800 MHz and 900 MHz channels located on at least one of those base
stations count as 50 kHz and 25 kHz, respectively. This total can be reduced using a 10 percent population overlap test
similar to that used for the current cellular-PCS spectrum cap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Licensing Rules and Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 332 of the Act, as amended by the Budget Act, provides that CMRS providers are to be ``treated as common carriers
for purposes of (the) Act.'' The Order concludes that this means, among other things, that all CMRS applications must
comply with common carrier licensing procedures enumerated in Title III of the Act. Thus, the Order adopts rules that
implement those procedures with regard to existing licensees and future applicants on SMR, Business Radio, 220 MHz,
and Part 90 paging frequencies who provide or propose to provide service that meets the CMRS definition.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, the following presents a partial list of measures the Commission is adopting to ensure that CMRS applications
under part 90 comply with the statutory requirements for licensing of common carriers under Title III of the Act, as
well as to streamline and unify processing of all CMRS and PMRS applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application Forms and Procedures_The Order adopts a single unified application form (Form 600) for all CMRS and PMRS
applicants in all terrestrial services. Form 600 will also be used to determine the regulatory classification of
an applicant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Qualifying Information_All parties to a CMRS application will be required to comply with the alien ownership restrictions
of section 310(b) of the Act and must also disclose whether: (1) Any party has had a Commission license or permit revoked;
(2) any party has been found by a court to have monopolized radio communication; or (3) any party has been convicted
of a felony. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application Fees and Regulatory Fees_Currently, application fees can only be changed by Congress. Therefore, the
existing application fee schedule will continue to govern fee requirements. If, however, Congress acts to extend
to the Commission authority to modify the fee schedules, we will address the question of altering our regulatory fees
at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Notice and Petition To Deny Procedures_The Order adopts rules that apply the public notice and petition to
deny procedures currently contained in part 22 to all CMRS applicants. In addition to applications for initial licenses,
these procedures will extend to applications for major modifications and for assignments and transfers of part 90
CMRS licenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mutually Exclusive Applications and Competitive Bidding_The Order Adopts rule changes that will generally result
in using 30-day notice and cut-off procedures and competitive bidding to select among mutually exclusive initial
CMRS applications in part 22 services (except for Phase I cellular unserved area applications), 900 MHz SMR service,
and 800 MHz SMR service. For Phase I cellular applications the Order adopts a one-day filing window, concluding that
such a window is sufficient because there is a date certain on which applications for unserved areas are permitted
to be filed. The Order adopts no changes to application procedures for 929&hyph;930 MHz paging in Part 90, but notes
that some procedural changes are likely to be considered in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment of Applications and License Modification_The Order adopts rule changes that conform part 22 and part 90
definitions for initial applications and major and minor amendments and modifications, to the extent practicable.
Modification applications will be accepted for filing on a first-come, first-served basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conditional and Special Temporary Authority_The Order concludes that the waiting period for pre-grant construction
for part 22 CMRS should be reduced from 90 to 35 days, and we establish a 35-day waiting period for all CMRS. The Order
also determines that section 309(f) of the Act prohibits pre-grant operation under special temporary authority
(STA) except in those cases in which the applicant establishes that there are ``extraordinary circumstances'' where
a delay in operations would seriously prejudice the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, it is ordered that the rule changes made, as specified below, will become effective January 2, 1995,
pursuant to sections 4(i), 4(j), 7(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r), 332(c), and 332(d) of the Communications
Act of 1934 as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 154(j), 157(a), 302, 303(c), 303(f), 303(g), 303(r), 332(c), and 332(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further ordered that the acceptance of 800 MHz applications on the 280 SMR category channels is suspended, effective
August 9, 1994, except that applications for transfer or assignment of existing SMR facilities will continue to be
accepted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further ordered that authority is delegated to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, as specified herein, to develop
a new form or modify existing forms for licenses or applicants to certify and/or provide information showing that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
45 MHz limitation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No licensee in the broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR services (including all parties under common control) regulated
as CMRS (see &sect;20.9) shall have an attributable interest in a total of more than 45 MHz of licensed broadband PCS,
cellular, and SMR spectrum regulated as CMRS with significant overlap in any geographic area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
SMR spectrum. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To calculate the amount of attributable SMR spectrum for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, an entity must
count all 800 MHz channels and 900 MHz channels located at any SMR base station inside the geographic area (MTA or BTA)
where there is significant overlap. All 800 MHz channels located on at least one of those identified base stations
count as 50 kHz (25 kHz paired), and all 900 MHz channels located on at least one of those identified base stations count
as 25 kHz (12.5 kHz paired), except that no more than 10 MHz of SMR spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR service will be attributed
to an entity when determining compliance with the cap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant overlap. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, significant overlap of a PCS licensed service area and CGSA(s) (as
defined in &sect;22.911 of this chapter) or SMR service area(s) occurs when at least 10 percent of the population of
the PCS licensed service area, as determined by the 1990 census figures for the counties contained therein, is within
the CGSA(s) and/or SMR service area(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commission shall presume that an SMR service area covers less than 10 percent of the population of a PCS service
area if none of the base stations of the SMR licensee is located within the PCS service area. For an SMR licensee's base
stations that are located within a PCS service area, the channels licensed at those sites will be presumed to cover
10 percent of the population of the PCS service area, unless the licensee shows that its protected service contour
for all of its base stations covers less than 10 percent of the population of the PCS service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ownership attribution. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, ownership and other interests in broadband PCS licensees, cellular
licensees, or SMR licensees will be attributed to their holders pursuant to the following criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Controlling interest shall be attributable. Controlling interest means majority voting equity ownership,
any general partnership interest, or any means of actual working control (including negative control) over the operation
of the licensee, in whatever manner exercised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 20 percent or more of the equity,
or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular, or SMR licensee shall be attributed,
except that ownership will not be attributed unless the partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest
amount to at least 40 percent of the equity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS, cellular,
or SMR licensee if the ownership interest is held by a small business, a rural telephone company, or a business owned
by minorities and/or women, as these terms are defined in &sect;1.2110 of this chapter or other related provisions
of the Commission's rules, or if the ownership interest is held by an entity with a non-controlling equity interest
in a broadband PCS licensee or applicant that is a business owned by minorities and/or women.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock to
any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and, in the case of stock held in trust, to any person who has the right
to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal, or extra-trust
business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed
with the stock interests held in trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Non-voting stock shall be attributed as an interest in the issuing entity if in excess of the amounts set forth in
paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, options, or other interests (except non-voting
stock) with rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until conversion is effected,
except that this provision does not apply in determining whether an entity is a small business, a rural telephone company,
or a business owned by minorities and/or women, as these terms are defined in &sect;1.2110 of this chapter or other
related provisions of the Commission's rules.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Limited partnership interests shall be attributed to limited partners and shall be calculated according to both
the percentage of equity paid in and the percentage of distribution of profits and losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Officers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee shall be considered
to have an attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. The officers and directors of an entity
that controls a broadband PCS licensee or applicant, a cellular licensee, or an SMR licensee shall be considered to
have an attributable interest in the broadband PCS licensee or applicant, cellular licensee, or SMR licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Ownership interests that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be
determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain
and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership percentage
for an interest in any link in the chain exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it
were a 100 percent interest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Divestiture. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any party holding controlling or attributable ownership interests in SMR licensees accounting for more than 5 MHz
of SMR spectrum may be a party to a broadband PCS application (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
have a controlling or attributable interest in a broadband PCS applicant), and such PCS applicant will be eligible
for PCS licenses amounting to 40 MHz of broadband PCS spectrum in a geographical area, pursuant to the divestiture
procedures set forth in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Broadband PCS applicant shall certify on its bidder application that it and all parties to the application
will come into compliance with the limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If such an applicant is a successful bidder, it must submit with its long-form application a signed statement describing
its efforts to date and future plans to come into compliance with the limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth
in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If such an applicant is otherwise qualified, its application will be granted subject to a condition that the licensee
shall come into compliance with the limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth in this section within ninety (90)
days of final grant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Parties holding controlling interests in SMR licensees that conflict with the attribution threshold or geographic
overlap limitations set forth in this section will be considered to have come into compliance if they have submitted
to the Commission an application for assignment of license or transfer of control of the SMR licensee (see &sect;90.158
of this chapter) by which, if granted, such parties no longer would have an attributable interest in the SMR license.
If no such assignment or transfer application is tendered to the Commission within ninety (90) days of final grant,
the Commission may consider the short-form certification and the long-form divestiture statement to be material,
bad faith misrepresentations and shall invoke the condition on the PCS license, cancelling it automatically, shall
retain all monies paid to the Commission, and, based on the facts presented, shall take any other action it may deem
appropriate. Divestiture may be to an interim trustee if a buyer has not been secured in the required period of time,
as long as the applicant has no interest in or control of the trustee, and the trustee may dispose of the license as it
sees fit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where parties to broadband PCS applications hold less than controlling (but still attributable) interests
in SMR licensee(s), they shall submit, within ninety (90) days of final grant, a certification that the applicant
and all parties to the application have come into compliance with the limitations on spectrum aggregation set forth
in this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two or more pending applications are mutually exclusive if the grant of one application would effectively preclude
the grant of one or more of the others under Commission rules governing the Public Mobile Services involved. The Commission
uses the general procedures in this section for processing mutually exclusive applications in the Public Mobile
Services. Additional specific procedures are prescribed in the subparts of this part governing the individual Public
Mobile Services (see &sect;&sect;22.509, 22.717, and 22.949) and in part 1 of this chapter.

Separate applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any applicant that files an application knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications should
not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves,
render the application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels
or facilities should be filed in a separate application.

shall administer competitive bidding procedures in accordance with subpart Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such
procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other applications may be dismissed without
prejudice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group is an application for
modification or an application for facilities in the Rural Radiotelephone Service, the Commission may attempt to
resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached
within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration
in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes of all the applications in the filing group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

mobile radio license if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Commission is unable to make the public interest determinations required under the Communications Act with
respect to both parties to the assignment or transfer; or

Amendment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pending applications concerning facilities for providing commercial mobile radio services may be amended as a matter
of right if such applications have not been designated for hearing or listed in a Public Notice for a random selection
or competitive bidding process, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section. If a petition
to deny or other formal objection has been filed, a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be served on the petitioner.
If the Commission has issued a Public Notice stating that the application appears to be mutually exclusive with another
application (or applications), a copy of any amendment (or other filing) must be served on any such mutually exclusive
applicant (or applicants).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Amendments to applications that resolve mutual exclusivity may be filed at any time, subject to the requirements
of &sect;90.162.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Amendments to applications designated for hearing may be allowed by the presiding officer and amendments to applications
selected in a random selection process may be allowed by the Commission for good cause shown. In such instances, a written
petition demonstrating good cause must be submitted and served upon the parties of record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dismissal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission may dismiss any application for authorization, assignment of authorization, or consent to transfer
of control of a commercial mobile radio facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Upon request by the applicant; Any applicant may request that its application be returned or dismissed. A request
for the return of an application after it has been listed on Public Notice as tentatively accepted for filing is considered
to be a request for dismissal of that application without prejudice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application with prejudice, the Commission will dismiss the application
with prejudice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the applicant requests dismissal of its application without prejudice, the Commission will dismiss that
application without prejudice, unless
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The application has been designated for comparative hearing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) It has been selected in a random selection process; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) It is an application for which the applicant submitted the winning bid in a competitive bidding process. If the
applicant requests dismissal of its application for which it submitted the winning bid in a competitive bidding process,
the Commission will dismiss that application with prejudice. If the applicant requests dismissal of its application
after that application has been designated for comparative hearing or selected in a random selection process, it
may submit a written petition requesting that the dismissal be without prejudice. Such petition must demonstrate
good cause, comply with &sect;90.162 of this part, and be served upon all parties of record. The Commission may grant
such petition and dismiss the application without prejudice or deny the petition and dismiss the application with
prejudice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the application is untimely filed; The Commission may dismiss without prejudice any application that is prematurely
or filed late, including any application filed prior to the opening date or after the closing date of a filing window,
or after the cut-off date for a mutually exclusive application filing group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the application is mutually exclusive with another application that is selected or granted in accordance with
the rules in this part; The Commission may dismiss any mutually exclusive application:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) For which the applicant did not submit the winning bid in a competitive bidding process;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That is included in a random selection process but is not granted; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) That receives comparative consideration in a hearing but is not granted by order of the presiding officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For failure to prosecute; The Commission may dismiss applications for failure of the applicant to prosecute or
for failure of the applicant to respond substantially within a specified time period to official correspondence
or requests for additional information. Such dismissal will generally be without prejudice if the failure to prosecute
or respond occurred prior to designation of the application for comparative hearing or prior to selection of the application
in a random selection process, but may be with prejudice in cases of non-compliance with &sect;90.162. Dismissal
will generally be with prejudice if the failure to prosecute or respond occurred after designation of the application
for comparative hearing or after selection of the application in a random selection process. The Commission may dismiss
applications with prejudice for failure of the applicant to comply with requirements related to a competitive bidding
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If the requested spectrum is not available; The Commission may dismiss any application that requests spectrum
which is unavailable because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It was previously assigned to another licensee on an exclusive basis or cannot be assigned to the applicant without
causing interference; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Reasonable efforts have been made to coordinate the proposed facility with foreign administrations under applicable
international agreements, and an unfavorable response (harmful interference anticipated) has been received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the application is found to be defective. Such dismissal may be ``without prejudice,'' meaning that the Commission
may accept from the applicant another application for the same purpose at any later time, or ``with prejudice,'' meaning
that the Commission will not accept from the applicant another application for the same purpose for a period of one
year following the date of the dismissal action taken by the Commission. Unless otherwise provided in this part, a
dismissed application will not be returned to the applicant. The Commission may dismiss without prejudice applications
that it finds to be defective. An application for authorization or assignment of authorization is defective if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) It is unsigned or incomplete with respect to required answers to questions, informational showings, or other
matters of a formal character; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) It requests an authorization that would not comply with the Commission's Rules and does not contain a request
for waiver of these rule(s), or in the event that the Commission denies such a waiver request, does not contain an alternative
proposal that fully complies with the rules.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Parties that have filed an application concerning facilities used to provide commercial mobile radio services
that is mutually exclusive with one or more other applications, and then enter into an agreement to resolve the mutual
exclusivity by withdrawing or requesting dismissal of the application or an amendment thereto, must obtain the approval
of the Commission. Parties that have filed or threatened to file a petition to deny, informal objection, or other pleading
against a pending application, and then seek to withdraw or request dismissal of, or refrain from filing, the petition,
either unilaterally or in exchange for a financial consideration, must obtain the approval of the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The party withdrawing or requesting dismissal of its application, petition to deny, informal objection, or other
pleading, or refraining from filing a pleading, must submit to the Commission a request for approval of the withdrawal
or dismissal, a copy of any written agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal, and an affidavit setting forth:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A certification that neither the party nor its principals has received or will receive any money or other consideration
in excess of the legitimate and prudent expenses incurred in preparing and prosecuting the application, petition
to deny, informal objection, or other pleading in exchange for the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition
to deny, informal objection, or other pleading, or threat to file a pleading, except that this provision does not apply
to dismissal or withdrawal of applications pursuant to bona fide merger agreements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The exact nature and amount of any consideration received or promised;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An itemized accounting of the expenses for which it seeks reimbursement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The terms of any oral agreement related to the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal
objection, or other pleading or threat to file a pleading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, within five (5) days of the filing date of the applicant's or petitioner's request for approval, each
remaining party to any written or oral agreement must submit an affidavit setting forth:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A certification that neither the applicant nor its principals has paid or will pay money or other consideration
in excess of the legitimate and prudent expenses of the petitioner in exchange for withdrawing or dismissing the application,
petition to deny, informal objection, or other pleading; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The terms of any oral agreement relating to the withdrawal or dismissal of the application, petition to deny, informal
objection, or other pleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) No person shall make or receive any payments in exchange for withdrawing a threat to file or refraining from filing
a petition against an application. For purposes of this section, reimbursement by an applicant of the legitimate
and prudent expenses of a potential petitioner or objector, incurred reasonably and directly in preparing to file
a petition to deny, will not be considered to be payment for refraining from filing a petition to deny or an informal
objection. Payments made directly to a potential petitioner or objector, or a person related to a potential petitioner
or objector, to implement non-financial promises are prohibited unless specifically approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) For purposes of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Affidavits filed pursuant to this section must be executed by the filing party, if an individual, a partner having
personal knowledge of the facts, if a partnership, or an officer having personal knowledge of the facts, if a corporation
or association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applications, petitions to deny, informal objections, and other pleadings are deemed to be pending before the
Commission from the time the application or petition to deny is filed with the Commission until such time as an order
of the Commission granting, denying, or dismissing the application, petition to deny, informal objection, or other
pleading is no longer subject to reconsideration by the Commission or to review by any court.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) ``Legitimate and prudent expenses'' are those expenses reasonably incurred by a party in preparing to file, filing,
prosecuting and/or settling its application, petition to deny, informal objection, or other pleading for which
reimbursement is sought.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contain specific allegations of fact which, except for facts of which official notice may be taken, are supported
by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof, and which are sufficient to demonstrate that

filing would be inconsistent with the public interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Be filed within 30 days after the date of the Public Notice listing the major filing; and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitions to deny a major amendment to an application may raise only matters directly related to the major amendment
that could not have been raised in connection with the application as originally filed. This paragraph does not apply
to petitioners who gain standing because of the major amendment.

Classification of filings as major or minor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications and amendments to applications are classified as major or minor when such filings concern facilities
used to provide commercial mobile radio services. Categories of major and minor filings are listed in section 309
of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (47 U.S.C. 309). In general, a major filing is a request for a Commission
action that has the potential to affect parties other than the applicant. The following are major filings:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initial station authorization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Filings for an initial authorization as defined in &sect;90.165(d)(2) are major.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ownership or control change. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Filings are major if they specify a substantial change in beneficial ownership or control (de jure or de facto), unless
such change is involuntary or if the filing merely amends an application to reflect a change in ownership or control
that has already been approved by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications for renewal of authorizations are major.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Filings are major if they request authorization for a facility that would have a significant environmental effect,
as defined by &sect;&sect;1.1301 through 1.1319 of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In the Specialized Mobile Radio Service, in addition to filings listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section,
filings are major if they:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Request a change in frequency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Request an authorization that would increase the effective radiated power or antenna height above average terrain
in any azimuth from an existing transmitter authorized to the filer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Request an authorization that would relocate an existing fixed transmitter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Amend a pending application to change a requested frequency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Amend a pending application in a way that would increase the proposed effective radiated power or antenna height
above average terrain in any azimuth from an existing transmitter authorized to the filer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Amend a pending application to change the location of a fixed transmitter from that previously proposed in the
application; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Amend a pending application for which pre-filing coordination was required to change the technical proposal
substantially from that which was coordinated with other users.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any applicant that files an application knowing that it will be mutually exclusive with one or more applications should
not include in the mutually exclusive application a request for other channels or facilities that would not, by themselves,
render the application mutually exclusive with those other applications. Instead, the request for such other channels
or facilities should be filed in a separate application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Filing groups. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pending mutually exclusive applications are processed in filing groups. Mutually exclusive applications in a filing
group are given concurrent consideration. The Commission may dismiss as defective (pursuant to &sect;90.162) any
mutually exclusive applications(s) whose filing date is outside of the date range for inclusion in the filing group.
The types of filing groups used in day-to-day application processing are specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
A filing group is one of the following types:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Renewal filing group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A renewal filing group comprises a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization and all timely-filed
mutually exclusive competing applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Same-day filing group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A same-day filing group comprises all mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is the same day, which is
normally the filing date of the first-filed applications(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Thirty-day notice and cut-off filing group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 30-day notice and cut-off filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is no later
than thirty (30) days after the date of the Public Notice listing the first-filed application(s) (according to the
filing dates) as acceptable for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Window filing group. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A window filing group comprises mutually exclusive applications whose filing date is within an announced filing
window. An announced filing window is a period of time between and including two specific dates, which are the first
and last dates on which applications (or amendments) for a particular purpose may be accepted for filing. In the case
of a one-day filing window, the two dates are the same. The dates are made known to the public in advance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the Commission may grant one application in a filing group of mutually exclusive applications and dismiss
the other application(s) in the filing group that are excluded by the grant, pursuant to &sect;90.162.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection methods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In selecting the application to grant, the Commission may use competitive bidding, random selection, or comparative
hearings, depending on the type of applications involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dismissal of applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission may dismiss any application in a filing group that is defective or otherwise subject to dismissal under
&sect;90.162, either before or after employing selection procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Type of filing group used. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as otherwise provided in this part, the type of filing group used in processing of two or more mutually exclusive
applications depends on the purpose(s) of the applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If one of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal of an authorization,
a renewal filing group is used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If any mutually exclusive application filed on the earliest filing date is an application for modification and
none of the mutually exclusive applications is a timely-filed application for renewal, a same-day filing group is
used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If all of the mutually exclusive applications filed on the earliest filing date are applications for initial
authorization, a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group is used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Disposition. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If there is only one application in any type of filing group, the Commission may grant that application and dismiss
without prejudice any mutually exclusive applications not in the filing group. If there is more than one mutually
exclusive application in a filing group, the Commission disposes of these applications as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Applications in a renewal filing group. All mutually exclusive applications in a renewal filing group are designated
for comparative consideration in a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If all of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group are applications for
initial authorization, the Commission administers competitive bidding procedures in accordance with subpart
Q of part 1 of this chapter. After such procedures, the application of the successful bidder may be granted and the other
applications may be dismissed without prejudice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If any of the mutually exclusive applications in a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group is an application for
modification or an application for facilities, the Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating
a settlement between the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate
all applications in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing
disposes all of the applications in the filing group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Applications in a same-day filing group. If there are two or more mutually exclusive applications in a same-day
filing group, the Commission may attempt to resolve the mutual exclusivity by facilitating a settlement between
the applicants. If a settlement is not reached within a reasonable time, the Commission may designate all applications
in the filing group for comparative consideration in a hearing. In this event, the result of the hearing disposes all
of the applications in the filing group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Applications in a window filing group. Applications in a window filing group are processed in accordance with
the procedures for a 30-day notice and cut-off filing group in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Partial and conditional grants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Application for extension of time to commence service may be made on Commission Form 600. Extensions of time must
be filed prior to the expiration of the construction period. Extensions will be granted only if the licensee shows
that the failure to commence service is due to causes beyond his or her control. No extensions will be granted for delays
caused by lack of financing, lack of site availability, for the assignment or transfer of control of an authorization,
or for failure to timely order equipment. If the licensee orders equipment within 90 days of the license grant, a presumption
of due diligence is created.

(b) Each applicant for a non-SMR trunked system must certify that a minimum of seventy (70) mobiles for each channel
authorized will be placed into operation within five (5) years of the initial license grant. Except for SMR systems
licensed in the 806&hyph;821/851&hyph;866 MHz band and as indicated in paragraph (i) of this section, if at the end
of five (5) years a trunked system is not loaded to the prescribed levels and all channels in the licensee's category
are assigned in the system's geographic area, authorizations for trunked channels not loaded to seventy (70) mobile
stations cancels automatically at a rate that allows the licensee to retain one channel for every one hundred (100)
mobiles loaded, plus one additional channel. If a trunked system has channels from more than one category, General
Category channels are the first channels considered to cancel automatically. All non-SMR licensees initially authorized
before June 1, 1993, that are within their original license term, or SMR licensees that are within the term of a two-year
authorization granted in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, are subject to this condition. A licensee
that has authorized channels cancelled due to failure to meet the above loading requirements will not be authorized
additional channels to expand that same system for a period of six (6) months from the date of cancellation.

(c) Except for SMR applicants and as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an applicant seeking to expand a trunked
system by requesting additional channels from the Commission, or through intercategory sharing, or through an assignment,
must have a loading level of seventy (70) mobiles per channel on the existing system that is the subject of the expansion
request.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 4 to the FMP was approved on November 5, 1993, and implemented on March 1, 1994. Amendment 4 changed the primary
management strategy from a meat count (size) control to effort control. The FMP controls total fishing effort through
limited entry and a schedule of reductions in allowable time at sea. Supplemental measures include gear restrictions,
limits on the number of crew members, and vessel restrictions. There are also catch limits for vessels not in the limited
access fishery and a framework procedure for adjusting all the management measures in the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This framework adjustment exempts Federal permit holders from Federal gear restrictions when fishing in state waters
under a state management program that has been determined by NMFS not to jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort
reduction objectives of the FMP. The principal gear restrictions from which participants in the program are exempted
are minimum ring size requirements, restrictions on dredge width, the use of chafing gear, ring configuration and
linkage restrictions, and restrictions on spare dredges and nets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current state management measures in Maine and Massachusetts and the restrictions proposed by New Hampshire have
been determined by NMFS not to jeopardize the fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the FMP. All have
restrictions that are adequate to address Federal conservation and management concerns because they have overall
gear requirements that are more restrictive than Federal regulations and because they apply to scallop resources
that are predominantly in state waters. Massachusetts and New Hampshire management measures, in particular, are
more restrictive because both include a minimum 31/4-inch (83-mm) ring size requirement in addition to other restrictions
on dredge size. The Gulf of Maine and Cape Cod stocks of sea scallops are separate from the major stocks on Georges Bank
and in the Mid-Atlantic area, and therefore are not included in the rebuilding program for the fishery. Based on landings,
approximately 80 percent of the Gulf of Maine fishery takes place in state waters and its management is predominately
a state responsibility.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this action is to allow Federal permit holders to compete in the state waters fishery on a more equitable
basis where Federal and state laws are inconsistent and to encourage vessels with general category permits to fish
under the exemption program and continue to submit catch and effort data. Not implementing an exemption could force
general category vessels that target scallops to cancel their Federal permits and be exempt from all Federal requirements,
including reporting of landings while fishing in state waters. These vessels are able to re-apply for a general category
permit at anytime. Conversely, limited access permit holders that voluntarily relinquish their permits can not
re-apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without this exemption, the most significant inconsistency between the requirements of Federal vs. state sea scallop
fishery permit holders occurs in Maine. (Maine does not have ring size restrictions, but both Massachusetts and New
Hampshire have regulations that are the same or are more restrictive than Federal regulations.) Maine-permitted
boats typically fish with 3-inch (76-mm) rings or smaller. Because the Gulf of Maine sea scallop resource normally
consists of beds of spatfall that belong to the same year class and thus all have almost the same shell size, Maine-permitted
boats would leave few scallops for federally permitted vessels with 31/4-inch (83-mm) rings or larger. Under this
gear exemption program, which allows Federal permit holders to use smaller rings in state waters, Federal permit
holders can compete on an equal footing with Maine state-waters-only vessel operators whose dredges have rings that
are smaller than allowed under Federal regulations. Although this particular inconsistency does not exist in Massachusetts
and New Hampshire, there are other restrictions in those states relating to gear that could create a competitive disadvantage
between state and Federal permit holders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exemption program also allows Federal permit holders to avoid the cost of changing the rings on existing gear if
they intend to use the gear only in state waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts of the adjustment fall within the scope of the impacts analyzed in Amendment 4 to the FMP and the FSEIS. The
rationale and analyses of expected biological effects, economic impacts, impacts on employment are discussed further
in the framework adjustment document (see

Comments on Draft Framework No. 2 and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS is amending the scallop regulations following the procedure for framework adjustments established by Amendment
4 and codified in 50 CFR part 650, subpart C. The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) followed the framework
procedure when making this adjustment by developing and analyzing the actions over three Council meetings, on May
11, June 30, and September 21, 1994. The Council provided the public with advance notice of both the proposal and the
analysis, and the opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the Council meetings. Upon review of the analysis and
public comment (see below), the Council recommended to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director),
that the measures contained in this framework adjustment be published as a final rule. The Regional Director has agreed
with this determination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed disbelief that fishing in Maine with 3-inch (76-mm) rings and a dredge as small as 41/4 ft (1.4
m) would be a violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current regulations would require Federal permit holders to change the rings on their dredges to 31/4 inches (83 mm)
during the 1994&hyph;5 season, and again to 31/2 inches (89 mm) in 1996, even if they were fishing strictly in state
waters. The gear exemption will allow fishermen to continue to use rings smaller than 31/4 inches (83 mm) along with
the dredge sizes required by Maine regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were two comments dealing with keeping track of vessels and where they fish. One commenter believes that the
vessel tracking system (VTS) must be required to accomplish this. The U.S. Coast Guard commented that it will be difficult
to determine who is fishing inside and outside of state waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The VTS is considered a potential aid to enforcement of this provision but is not essential to its enforcement. When
the VTS requirement is implemented, all limited access vessels required to have a VTS under a Federal permit (full-time
and part-time vessels) must use them while fishing in the state waters exemption program. Limited access vessels
in the occasional category will continue to be required to call in, but general permit holders will not be required
to call in while in the state waters exemption program. General permit holders will be required to report landings
and other data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary Federal enforcement concern regarding the Gulf of Maine scallop resource is that vessels with state permits
only, or with exemptions from Federal requirements, might fish in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with gear not
meeting Federal requirements. This problem exists whether or not a gear exemption program for Federal permit holders
is implemented. Also, Federal enforcement personnel must still monitor scallop gear used by Federal limited access
permit holders. Lists of vessels participating in the exemption program will be given periodically to enforcement
agents to minimize problems. Therefore, exempting these vessels should not create any additional enforcement burden.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The gear exemption program responds to this concern by allowing vessels to fish in state waters with gear that conforms
to the requirements of state management programs, provided that the exemption does not jeopardize the achievement
of the fishing mortality/effort reduction objectives of the FMP.

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Maine Scallopers Association was concerned about the cost of VTS and thought that it should not be required while
vessels are fishing in state waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Vessels will not be required to purchase VTS because of the gear exemption program. Only vessels that will be required
to use VTS in the Federal limited access scallop fishery must use it while participating in the state waters fishery.

This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (AA), finds there is good cause to waive prior notice and opportunity
for comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). The provision of advance notice as described in this rule and public meetings
held by the Council to discuss the management measures implemented by this rule provided adequate prior notice and
opportunity for public comment to be considered. Thus, additional opportunity for public comment is unnecessary.
Because no proposed rule was required, this action is exempt from the procedures of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
The AA also finds that under section 553(d)(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act, because immediate implementation
of this rule relieves a restriction that would require vessels fishing in state waters to fish under the Federal gear
requirements, there is no need to delay for 30 days the effectiveness of this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule contains collection-of-information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. These requirements
have been approved by OMB under Control Number 0648&hyph;0202. The reporting burden is estimated at 2 minutes per
response. This time includes reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining
the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden
estimate or any other aspect of this collection-of-information requirement, including suggestions for reducing
the burden, to NMFS and OMB (see

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan
for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing
the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B) the allocation of Pacific cod in the Western Regulatory Area of the
GOA for vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component was established by the 1994 specifications
of groundfish harvest (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) as 14,967 metric tons (mt). The directed fishery for Pacific
cod by the inshore component closed on March 8, 1994 (59 FR 11209, March 10, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that, as of October 22, 1994, 500 mt of the TAC of Pacific cod for the
inshore component in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA remains unharvested. This amount is in excess of the amount
necessary as incidental catch by vessels using pot or jig gear in other groundfish fisheries. Directed fishing for
groundfish by vessels using hook-and-line or trawl gear is prohibited, because the allocations of Pacific halibut
bycatch mortality for those gears have been reached. Therefore, NMFS is terminating the closure and is opening directed
fishing for Pacific cod in the Western GOA by vessels catching Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component
effective at 12 noon, A.l.t., November 19, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Pratt
&amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, that currently requires initial and repetitive inspections of
certain front compressor fan hubs and shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius. This action would reduce
the initial inspection interval for front compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft,
establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements. This proposal is prompted
by a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture installed in a Boeing 737 aircraft that resulted in the release of
fan blades and portions of the hub outer rim. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fracture
of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Amendment 39&hyph;8638 (58 FR 39644, July 26, 1993), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan
engines, to require initial and repetitive inspections for cracks, and removal from service, if necessary, of certain
front compressor fan hubs. Front compressor fan hubs installed on engines in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft
must be inspected according to a more aggressive schedule than other installations. In addition, that AD requires
shotpeening of the forward and aft rim to web radius area of hubs that pass the inspections. That action was prompted
by reports of two front compressor fan hub fractures on engines operating in the No. 2 position on Boeing 727 aircraft.
That condition, if not corrected, could result in a fracture of the front compressor fan hub, which can result in an
uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has received a report of a front compressor fan hub fracture on a PW JT8D engine
installed on a Boeing 737 aircraft. The examination of the failed hardware revealed the failure mechanism to be identical
to that described in AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14. The analysis conducted for that AD concluded that the vibratory stress
environment that caused fan hub fractures was the most severe for engines installed in the No. 2 position on Boeing
727 aircraft. Therefore, the FAA addressed this population in a more aggressive manner than engines installed in
other aircraft, or in the No. 1 or No. 3 position on Boeing 727 aircraft. The FAA determined that a similar, but less severe
stress environment existed in engines installed in other aircraft or positions other than the No. 2 position in the
Boeing 727 aircraft, and inspection and shotpeening requirements were specified for these engines in AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14.
Since the failure of the fan hub installed in the Boeing 737 aircraft, the FAA has reassessed the risk analysis for all
installations and determined that the predicted risk level should be reduced. Therefore, the FAA proposes to supersede
AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 with a reduced initial fan hub inspection requirement for engines installed in all positions
of all applicable aircraft, by requiring engines removed from the Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position to adhere to the
Boeing 727 aircraft No. 2 position inspection requirements, and by establishing a compliance end-date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has received comments from operators that the wording of paragraph (b)(4) of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 is confusing.
The FAA has revised the wording to emphasize that the repetitive inspection is required at the next opportunity when
the front compressor fan hub is accessible at the detail level in the shop only after accumulating 2,500 additional
cycles in service (CIS) since the last inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the FAA has revised the wording in paragraph (d) that defines a shop visit as an engine removal for engine
maintenance that cannot be performed while installed in the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14, PW has issued Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 6104, Revision 3, dated
June 16, 1994, that describes the reduced initial inspection intervals for the applicable engine installations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;14&hyph;14 to reduce the initial inspection interval for front
compressor fan hubs installed in all positions of all applicable aircraft, revise the compliance requirements for
repositioned engines, establish a compliance end-date, and clarify the wording of the compliance requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1475 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry and 690 domestic uninstalled engines would
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 12 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed
actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,428,900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 70 contains regulations requiring States to develop, and submit to EPA for approval, programs for issuing operating
permits to major, and certain other, stationary sources of air pollution. The minimum elements of operating permits
programs are contained in part 70 which was promulgated on July 21, 1992 (57 FR 32250).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequent to promulgation of part 70, nearly 20 entities, including State and local governments, environmental
groups, and industry associations, petitioned for judicial review of the part 70 regulations. One of the key aspects
of the litigation and of an operating permits program is the system for revising permits to incorporate changes at
permitted sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several requests for an extension of the comment period on the proposal notice have been received to allow time for
preparation of comments primarily on how to fashion a more workable permit revision system. Because of the complexity
of the proposed revisions, potential commenters assert that the 90-comment period provided is not long enough to
prepare comprehensive comments on the permit revision system as well as all the other proposed revisions. An additional
45 days is therefore being provided for development and submittal of comments.

 EPA is extending the comment period for an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) for significant new uses of
lead issued under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Significant new use rules for lead would
require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import, or processing of lead and
lead compounds for uses identified by the Agency as significant new uses. The ANPR was published in the

 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 28, 1994 (59 FR 49484), EPA published an ANPR for significant new uses of lead issued under section 5(a)(2)
of TSCA. Significant new use rules for lead would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the
manufacture, import, or processing of lead and lead compounds for uses identified by the Agency as significant new
uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA issued this ANPR to: (1) Communicate its intention to regulate significant new uses of elemental lead and lead
compounds; (2) identify components of its proposed regulatory approach; (3) request comment on issues related to
this approach; and (4) request comment and information on existing uses of lead that would help support EPA's selection
of proposed criteria for defining significant new uses of lead. Written comments on the ANPR were to be received on
or before November 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has received several requests from trade associations seeking a 60&hyph;day extension of the public comment
period because of additional time needed to provide EPA with information requested in the ANPR. EPA believes that
providing an additional 60&hyph;day period to prepare written comments is reasonable. The Agency, therefore, is
extending the comment period 60 days in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to comment fully. Written
and electronic comments submitted in response to the ANPR must be received on or before January 27, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice responds to a notice of request for comments that NHTSA published in 1993 implementing the grant of a petition
by Robert Bosch GmbH. It proposes an amendment to the Federal motor vehicle standard on lighting that would permit
replaceable lenses on integral beam and replaceable bulb headlamps that incorporate on-board headlamp aimers,
provided that such headlamps meet more rigorous environmental tests. The benefit of headlamps with replaceable
lenses is that the lens or reflector could be replaced in the event of breakage of either without the present necessity
to replace both components if only one is damaged.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 12, 1993, NHTSA published a Notice of Request for Comments in implementation of a grant of a petition for rulemaking
submitted by Robert Bosch GmbH (58 FR 42924). The notice sought views relevant to a decision on whether to proceed with
rulemaking to amend Standard No. 108 to allow the lens to be replaceable on a replaceable bulb headlamp equipped with
an on-vehicle aiming device. In addition to comments on the five benefits ascribed by Bosch to replaceable lens headlamps,
NHTSA asked for comments on fifteen relevant issues. The reader is referred to the notice for further information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were submitted by 21 interested persons: Advocates for Highway Safety (Advocates), American Automobile
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), American Honda, Fiat Auto R&amp;D USA, Ford Motor Company, General Electric
Worldwide Automotive Lighting (GE), General Motors Corp. (GM), Hella KG Hueck &amp; Co., KC Hilites, Koito Manufacturing
Co. Inc., Oscar Lidstrom, Jr., Maine Bureau of Highway Safety, Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles, Mercedes-Benz
of North America, Osram Sylvania, Inc., PACCAR, Inc., Stanley Electric Co. Ltd., Virginia State Police, Volkswagen
of North America (on behalf of itself and Audi), Volvo of North America, and J. L. Witt. The concept of replaceable lenses
for certain headlamps was opposed by three commenters: Advocates, GE, and KC Hilites. Six others expressed reservations:
AAMA, GM, Maine, Massachusetts, Stanley, and Koito. The remaining 12 commenters either actively supported the concept
or submitted comments that did not indicate opposition to it. Where appropriate, these comments are mentioned in
the discussion of issues that follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's evaluation of the comments that were submitted has synthesized agency concerns into three issues: the photometric
performance of headlamps after relensing, the durability performance of headlamps before and after relensing,
and the economic benefits to the consumer of replaceable lens headlamps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Photometric Performance of Headlamps After Relensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first issue of concern is whether a headlamp with a replaceable lens will provide photometric performance equivalent
to a headlamp using the original lens. NHTSA had previously denied two petitions (from GM and BMW of North America)
for replaceable lens headlamps, principally from concern for potential aiming problems and corroded reflectors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for misaim has two bases. The first is relevant to mechanically aimable headlamps, which have three
alignment pads on the lens to orient alignment tools. Some designs use pads ground to the individual characteristics
of each reflector/lens assembly. This creates lamp-to-lamp differences in lenses, irrelevant when the lens is permanently
attached to the reflector assembly, but of possible concern when lenses may be replaced. Even in designs without custom
ground pads, continuation of proper aim is dependent upon the repeatability of the attachment of the lens to the reflector.
Small differences in fit or gasket crush could modify the interaction between the reflector and the lens and thereby
reorient the aiming pads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aiming pad issue does not arise under the Bosch petition because it includes only headlamps with on-board aiming
devices, which aim the reflector without reference to the lens. Bosch provided data from photometric tests demonstrating
that, absent the aiming pad considerations, headlamp photometry was insensitive to lens replacement. The illumination
at required test points produced by the test reflector and bulb was nearly identical in each test, using five replaceable
lenses with different production dates. The differences between lenses of the same part number and any variations
in lens alignment due to repeated replacement had no apparent effect on the photometric performance of the combination
of new components.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Advocates had criticized the minimum ``above-horizontal'' illumination requirements established by the agency
for 1994 and newer model vehicle headlamps as providing poorer performance than that of sealed beam headlamps. It
opposed lens replacement on the basis of a potential for a further reduction in ``above-horizontal'' illumination
which it believed would result from deviations in lens alignment during replacement. The Bosch data should allay
Advocates' concern, as should a comment by Osram Sylvania that headlamp photometry is not sensitive to the slight
misalignments possible during lens replacement. Although Osram Sylvania had other criticisms of replaceable lenses,
it reported that common design practices for replaceable bulb headlamps limit the sensitivity of photometric performance
to lens misalignment and that replacement lenses need not be identical to original lenses to maintain equivalent
photometric performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, comments and data submitted to the docket are persuasive that photometric performance of new lamps is
not sensitive to typical production variations of replacement lenses. For the reasons expressed above, it appears
that headlamps with on-vehicle aiming and replaceable lenses are equivalent in photometric performance to headlamps
with on-vehicle aiming and bonded lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Durability Performance of Headlamps Before and After Relensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For new headlamps, Standard No. 108's tests for dust penetration, corrosion, humidity, vibration, and water sealing
should assure that headlamps with replaceable lenses will have a lens-to-reflector sealing that is equivalent to
the protection provided by headlamps with bonded lens/reflector assemblies. However, if the reflector of a headlamp
is affected by exposure during the period when the vehicle is operated with a broken lens or by improper cleaning attempts
during relensing, there is a strong possibility that an owner may continue to use the unit after relensing without
being aware of its degraded performance. Less than half of all states have periodic vehicle inspection, and those
that do differ in their rigor. Thus, inspection programs cannot be expected to detect the decreased photometric performance
of headlamps with degraded reflectors. The second potential problem is that the lens-seal integrity could be lost
during relensing, and that an otherwise good reflector would be subject to moisture and dust for the remaining life
of the vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflector degradation was not a concern before 1983 when replaceable bulb headlamps were allowed. In a sealed beam
lamp, a crack in the lens large enough to admit moisture would cause the filament to fail, necessitating the replacement
of the entire headlamp. However, replaceable bulb headlamps can continue to operate despite a broken lens, and the
possibility of degraded reflectors was considered by the agency during the course of rulemaking that allowed them.
The requirement for a bonded lens was motivated in part by NHTSA's desire to avoid creating a potential safety problem
that had been impossible when Standard No. 108 allowed only sealed beam headlamps. It is a conservative requirement
that results in the replacement of reflectors when the condition of the lens indicates possible long term exposure
of the reflector to water and dirt. Even a small hole can cause the headlamp to fill with water due to condensation during
the heating and cooling cycle of lamp use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A potential safety disadvantage of the bonded lens requirement is that the cost of replacing a headlamp rather than
a lens may tend to delay or to discourage repair altogether. However, the desire to maintain the aesthetic quality
of a newer vehicle and the obvious performance problem of a cracked lamp containing moisture should motivate many
owners to make a replacement, even if costly. A more powerful motivation is provided by the vehicle inspection programs
maintained by less than half of the states. Typically, the states inspect for aim and for damaged lenses, and in some
instances inspect replaceable bulbs for maximum power to prevent the use of high powered ``off road'' aftermarket
bulbs. But even strict states, such as Virginia, do not inspect for the low light output that would identify headlamps
with degraded reflectors. Many commenters who favored the concept of replaceable lenses voiced concerns about the
potential loss of performance of relensed units. AAMA suggested replaceable lenses for integral beam headlamps
as well as for those with replaceable bulbs, but it commented that any rulemaking allowing replaceable lenses must
assure that reflectors are designed to be more resistant to abrasion and solvents, with special durability and environmental
qualification requirements added. American Honda was concerned about technical problems which may exist in ensuring
that photometric performance is equal to the level of performance before the lens was damaged, and ensuring adequate
sealing against dust and moisture after the lens alone is replaced. GE commented that the average consumer or automotive
mechanic does not have the background and understanding to make the decisions necessary to determine if a headlamp
is safely repairable. Osram Sylvania agreed with the Bosch petition that reflector surfaces can be cleaned during
lens replacement, but it cautioned that the reflector can be damaged by improper cleaning and handling. It also advised
that the touch of human hands can deposit skin oil on the reflector with the possible consequences of reflector fogging,
reduced output and increased glare. It further commented that the lens replacement process could break the sealing
coat, protecting the thin aluminum coating on the reflector from moisture, which could lead to a very rapid loss of
reflecting area and photometric performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen's comments also responded to questions about performance loss of relensed lamps. It suggested that only
specially trained dealer service personnel should install lenses, presumably refusing to relens degraded lamps,
and that state inspections should monitor the condition of reflectors. These steps may be feasible in Europe where
reflector corrosion, at least in older designs, is a problem requiring universal inspection and where the manufacturers
control the replacement lens supply. But they are not effective in the United States. Less than half the States have
inspections, and those that do are not required to cover the condition of the reflector because it was never a concern
during the long era in which sealed beams were the only type of headlamps allowed. Also, the U.S. aftermarket would
not be limited to OEM lenses (conferring on dealers the power to refuse to repair degraded lamps) because non-OEM manufacturers
would be free to manufacture components and sell them directly to vehicle owners.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Volkswagen and American Honda commented that replaceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lens headlamps could be designed to require removal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp from the vehicle in order to replace the lens. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have the effect, desirable to the commenters, of causing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners to rely on the vehicle manufacturer's dealers for lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement. However, causing lens replacement to be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive and less convenient diminishes the prospect of greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp maintenance in states without inspection. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners compelled by state inspection to replace parts often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insist on making their own repairs to minimize their burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Making the task unnecessarily complex only increases the chances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the owner will make a poor repair. In the case of HID 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integral beam headlamps, easy removal of the lens without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disturbing the other components may reduce high voltage hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during owner repairs. The better solution, suggested by the AAMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and others, is to adopt durability and environmental requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for replaceable lens headlamps to increase the likelihood that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relensed headlamps will perform satisfactorily regardless of who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services them. This solution minimizes the potential loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance from degraded reflectors and maximizes the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for inexpensive voluntary lens repairs in states without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most detailed comments to the question of reflector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
durability were those of Ford Motor Company. They contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive statement of the reflector durability problem and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some general guidance concerning appropriate test procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford commented:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Replaceable bulb headlamps currently incorporate reflective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces not specifically designed to withstand direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental exposure or abrasion. If the condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prompting replacement of a lens has resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination or discoloration of the reflector surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., as might occur due to a lens crack or loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the lens/reflector seal), a degradation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric performance would be expected, as compared to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new replacement headlamp. Attempts to clean a contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector, as by wiping, could result in abrasion to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metallized surface, possibly resulting in degraded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric performance and/or increased glare. Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore recommends that rulemaking on replaceable lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamps consider the need for the reflective surfaces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lens headlamps to withstand appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental exposure and cleaning operations.

Ford recommends that headlamps with replaceable lenses, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to present requirements applicable to replaceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulb headlamps, be subjected to salt-fog, moisture and dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure without the lens in place. Additionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector surface should be capable of withstanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance to chemicals that are likely to be used by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers or repair facilities to clean contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector surfaces. Subsequent to appropriate environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and chemical exposure, the reflector should be cleaned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
according to a prescribed procedure. When fitted with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lens following exposure and cleaning, the headlamp should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of meeting the same photometric requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to replaceable bulb headlamps with bonded lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aftermarket lens manufacturers should be required to certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that any headlamp for which the lens is intended is capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of meeting photometric requirements when fitted with a lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that design. Additionally, aftermarket replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenses should be accompanied with complete instructions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly removing the old lens, cleaning the interior of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp body, cleaning and preparing the mating surface on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the headlamp body and installing the new lens on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headlamp body.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The durability and environmental requirements for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present replaceable bulb headlamps and the deliberations that led 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to them may be useful in considering reasonable requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps. When the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended Standard No. 108 to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was aware that German vehicle inspection data showed significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejections due to dull, corroded and damaged headlamp reflectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, NHTSA promulgated an appropriate test of corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance for replaceable bulb headlamps for use in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. The lamp assembly must be exposed for ten days in a salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray chamber, with the additional requirement than the bulb be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed and the spray deactivated during the last hour of all but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two test days. The test put a premium on the ability of the lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the reflector from the salt spray. It also required a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of direct corrosion resistance exceeding the performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of some European headlamps by having the lamps exposed to several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of salty air in the chamber without direct spray. In its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original form, the rule required that the headlamp pass the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric test at the completion of the corrosion test. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-exposure photometric test was later eliminated because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of salt deposits that could not be removed easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a headlamp with a bonded lens.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A corrosion test of increased rigor for reflectors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lens headlamps would remove much of the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern about relensing lamps that have become contaminated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dust and moisture. The agency is proposing a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental test for reflectors of replaceable lens headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it believes is consistent with Ford's recommendations while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposing minimum testing burdens. NHTSA is proposing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional salt spray test with the following features for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lens headlamps: (a) A 24 hour exposure to salt spray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the lens removed, (b) a 48 hour drying period, (c) cleaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reflector according to instructions to be furnished with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement lenses and included in the owner's manual, (d) a non-magnified examination for corrosion, and (e) a photometric
test of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the headlamp as reassembled with a new lens. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed reflector test mimics the existing test of headlamps with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenses but with a much reduced duration since reflector exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in service would not be continuous. However, it makes use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected salt deposit formation to test the durability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector coating to cleaning. Finally, it would require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer of a headlamp with a replaceable lens to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
photometric compliance of the reassembled cleansed lamp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford recommended three distinct tests of headlamp reflector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to salt-fog, moisture, and dust, while the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes a single test. Comment from parties familiar with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector construction and exposure testing is sought. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following questions are of particular interest: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A cracked lens frequently causes a headlamp to partially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fill with water. Is the moisture and exposure time involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ASTM B 117&hyph;73 salt spray test sufficient to test moisture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance of reflectors? If not, what test would be sufficient? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The present dust test for replaceable bulb headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses Portland cement as dust, and the agency presumes that Ford's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment refers to the same kind of dust test. Cleaning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflector after Portland cement dust exposure may be equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a rigorous abrasion test. The agency believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed salt-spay test will coat the headlamp reflector with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt deposits and that the subsequent cleaning will provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate abrasion test. However, does a 24-hour salt spray test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit enough salt to act as a de facto abrasion test? Should a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular method of salt removal be required or should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers' cleaning instructions dictate the test procedure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as proposed? Is a Portland cement dust test as well as a salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spray test of reflectors needed, and if so, why? Should a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abrasion test be used rather than the indirect abrasion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning, and if so, what procedure would be appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is the proposed 24-hour salt spray test followed by 48 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours drying time sufficient to test the headlamp reflectors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the metal light shields sometimes used? What corrosion criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate for light shields? Can rusty water dripping from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metal light shields eventually cause otherwise durable headlamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflectors to fail because of stains? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The present standard for replaceable bulb headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposes lamp assemblies with the bulb removed (but the lens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached) for eight hours to humid salty air in a salt spray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber with the salt spray turned off. Is this present test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(followed by a photometric test and whatever cleaning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary) sufficient to qualify headlamp reflectors for use with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaceable lenses without the proposed direct salt spray test or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the moisture, dust and salt spray tests recommended by Ford? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing Standard No. 108 also includes a chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance test of the exterior of the lamp to fuel, tar remover, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power steering fluid and antifreeze. NHTSA has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the test should be extended to headlamp reflectors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using chemicals suggested by the manufacturer in the cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions or with a realistic probability of use by vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners despite the manufacturer's instructions. Chemicals in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter category would include tar remover, lacquer thinner and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral spirits. The manufacturer's instructions may concentrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on water soluble contaminants because of the salt spray test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of the other chemicals gives the owner a means to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove organic contaminants without resorting to abrasion. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral spirits is a major constituent of tar remover, a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test for mineral spirits appears unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plastic lenses on replaceable bulb headlamps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured for use in the United States are given a hard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective coating that would be expected to exceed the reflector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coating requirements established by the proposed tests. NHTSA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that similar coating methods could be used to create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
robust reflectors for replaceable lens headlamps. It would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable to expect successful lens replacement by vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners, especially if the lens attachments were designed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accessible without disturbing the headlamp aim. The requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for headlamp reflector durability also reduces concern about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
untrained persons installing the lens seal. Should an owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
install the seal incorrectly, causing moisture to collect inside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lamp, the reflector will not degrade quickly. The visible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moisture would serve as a telltale, and an owner motivated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace the lens initially would be motivated to disassemble, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clean and reinstall the lens until the desired repair was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful. If manufacturers choose to design headlamps for ease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and economy of lens replacement by owners, the prospect of better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lamp maintenance in non-inspection States is realistic.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cost to replace two replaceable bulb headlamps can equal 10 percent of the value of an entire car after it is 5 to 8
years old. Consumers used to the cost of sealed beam headlamps are critical of state vehicle inspection programs when
they force the replacement of headlamps at costs which far exceed those of sealed beams. When Standard No. 108 was amended
to permit replaceable bulb headlamps, the economic consequences of lens/reflector assembly replacement were not
considered to be relevant to safety, and the ability to replace the light source gave some promise of consumer benefit.
Ironically, the economic burden to consumers now fuels a safety debate about whether the reluctance of owners to replace
expensive cracked lamps or the possibility of degraded performance of relensed lamps is the greater threat to safety.
The styling benefits of replaceable bulb headlamps over sealed beams have resulted in large potential cost penalties
and an unquantifiable degree of performance loss when the headlamps are damaged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen commented that the cost to replace a headlamp is 7 to 8 times that of the lens alone. It cited examples of lamps
costing $215 to $270 and estimated the cost of replaceable lenses in the $30 to $40 range. Mercedes estimated the cost
of replaceable lenses at $126 to $150 and complete headlamps at $250 to $640 with on-board aiming. While the cost of
headlamps with the fasteners, gaskets, and indexing features required for replaceable lens designs would be higher
than the cost of headlamps with simple bonded lenses, reductions in repair costs of 50% to 85% appear to be likely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that replaceable lens designs would be attractive only for headlamps using glass lenses.
These are predominantly used on imported vehicles. Replaceable bulb headlamps which have coated polycarbonate
plastic lenses are extremely resistant to cracking and chipping. AAMA commented that the impact resistance of plastic
lenses significantly reduces any servicing need to provide replaceable lenses. Glass lenses are less expensive
than coated plastic lenses, and they have greater resistance to high operating temperatures and abrasion by headlamp
wipers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the additional cost of a replaceable lens design would probably negate the economic advantage a manufacturer
might achieve by changing to a less expensive replaceable glass lens when it had been using bonded plastic lenses.
It is likely that the market for replaceable bulb headlamps with replaceable lenses would be confined to a small segment
of the import market in which headlamp wipers or high operating temperatures dictate the choice of glass lenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bosch's petition covered only replaceable bulb headlamps. However, AAMA commented that a greater economic benefit
of replaceable lenses could be found in integral beam headlamps. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are being developed
for use as integral beam headlamps, and their operating temperatures are expected to dictate the use of glass lenses.
An integral beam headlamp is required to be manufactured with the lens, bulb, reflector, cable and high voltage source
configured as an indivisible whole. HID headlamps are much more costly than replaceable bulb headlamps, and the prospect
of replacing the whole lamp (at perhaps $1000) in order to repair a cracked lens may be a significant impediment to introduction
of the technology. Since the industry-imposed economic burden on the consumer is the agency's primary reason for
considering replaceable lens headlamps, it is appropriate to include integral beam headlamps in the proposal.

Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is implementing its conclusions by proposing appropriate amendments to Standard No. 108. As noted above, the
proposed amendments cover integral beam headlamps as well as those with replaceable bulbs. The proposal requires
redefinitions of ``integral beam headlamp'' and ``replaceable bulb headlamp'' to clarify that some types of these
headlamps need not have a bonded lens reflector assembly, those with a vehicle headlamp aiming device (VHAD) conforming
to Standard No. 108. Under the proposal, each replacement lens would also have to be accompanied by an appropriate
replacement seal, and instructions to the user on how to remove and replace the lens, clean the reflector, and seal
the lens to the lamp. Manufacturers of replacement lenses would mark them with a DOT symbol which will be the manufacturer's
certification that installation of the lens on the headlamp for which it is intended will not create a noncompliance
with Standard No. 108. A new section is proposed that would add the chemical and corrosion resistance tests discussed
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The greatest impact of the proposal will be on future HID integral beam headlamps which may require heat resistant
glass lenses rather than impact resistant plastic lenses. These head-lamps will be very costly and their replacement
will involve high voltage components. The development of durable reflectors to make them suitable for replaceable
lens will be an important step in making HID lamps practical. Additionally, should future changes to the standard
accommodate HID light sources in replaceable bulb headlamps, the ability to have replaceable lenses would enhance
their economic viability as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments suggest that it is not critical to require replacement lenses to be identical to original lenses in order
to maintain photometric performance in compliance with the standard. The only necessary requirement is that the
replacement lens maintain compliance of an otherwise compliant headlamp in all respects including sealing. An additional
practical requirement is that a replacement lens be supplied with a new seal and instructions for cleaning the reflector
and installing the lens and seal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking action is
not significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rulemaking
action is to afford a further optional means of compliance with the headlamp requirements of Standard No. 108. While
a final rule could result in higher prices for buyers of glass-lensed headlamps of certain types, these initial costs
could be offset by reduced repair costs during the life of the vehicle or the headlamp. These cost impacts are not deemed
significant and preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted.

NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act. It is not anticipated
that a final rule based on this proposal would have a significant effect upon the environment. The design and composition
of headlamps which take advantage of this option may change from those presently in production but it is anticipated
that the kind of materials used will be the same.

The agency has also considered the impacts of this rulemaking action in relation to the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
I certify that this rulemaking action would not have a significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small
entities. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared. Manufacturers of motor vehicles
and headlamps, those affected by the rulemaking action, are generally not small businesses within the meaning of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Further, small organizations and governmental jurisdictions would not be significantly
affected because the price of new vehicles and the optional headlamps would be only minimally impacted. While the
price of new vehicle equipment might be somewhat higher if the optional headlamp is used, the cost of repair of such
equipment will be significantly lessened.

A final rule based on this proposal would not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 (formerly section
103(d) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1392(d)), whenever a Federal motor vehicle
safety standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30163 (formerly 15 U.S.C. 1394) sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that Deer Creek summer steelhead in Washington do not constitute a ``species'' under the Endangered
Species Act of 1973, as amended, (ESA) and, therefore, do not qualify for listing under the ESA at this time. However,
Deer Creek summer steelhead are part of a larger evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) that may warrant listing under
the ESA, and for which a status review is currently underway.

Petition Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1993, NMFS received a petition from Washington Trout to list indigenous, naturally-spawning Deer
Creek summer steelhead (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species and to designate critical habitat under the ESA. NMFS published a notice on December 23,
1993 (58 FR 68108), that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the listing may be warranted.
To ensure a comprehensive status review, NMFS solicited information and data concerning the present and historic
status of the Deer Creek summer steelhead population and whether this population qualifies as a ``species'' under
the ESA. NMFS also requested information on areas that may qualify as critical habitat for Deer Creek summer steelhead.
NMFS also initiated an expanded status review for all coastal steelhead in California, Oregon, and Washington. This
status review was expanded to include Idaho in response to a petition submitted by the Oregon Natural Resources Council
and 15 co-petitioners. NMFS initiated the status review for steelhead throughout its range in the four states on May
27, 1994 (59 FR 27527).

Biological Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NMFS Northwest Fisheries Science Center Biological Review Team has conducted a status review and prepared an
administrative report summarizing the conclusions of the status review, ``Conclusions of the Northwest Fisheries
Science Center's Review of a Petition to List Deer Creek Summer Steelhead (North Fork Stillaguamish River, Washington)
under the U.S. Endangered Species Act,'' which provides more detailed information, discussion, and references.
This report is available upon request (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and is summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deer Creek is a tributary of the North Fork Stillaguamish River in Washington. The Deer Creek Watershed covers 177
km

 in the North Cascade Mountains of Washington. Deer Creek and its steelhead fishery have been the subject of many sporting
journal articles and popular literature. Logging in the Deer Creek Basin began in the 1920s. Timber harvest activities
accelerated in the early 1950s, and approximately 48 percent of the basin was clear-cut between 1952 and 1985. In 1984,
a large landslide, which remains active despite restoration efforts, introduced a tremendous amount of sediment
into Deer Creek. The 1984 landslide reduced viable spawning and rearing habitat for the summer steelhead population,
which was already in decline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The name steelhead refers to the anadromous form of rainbow trout. Recently, the scientific name for the biological
species that includes both steelhead and rainbow trout was changed from

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This change reflects a belief that all trouts from western North America share a common lineage with Pacific salmon.
The present endemic distribution of steelhead extends from the Kamchatka Peninsula, Asia, east and south, along
the Pacific coast of North America, to Malibu Creek in southern California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steelhead exhibit a wide variety of life history strategies. In general, steelhead migrate to sea after spending
2 years in fresh water and then spend 2 years in the ocean prior to returning to fresh water to spawn. Deviations from
this basic pattern are common. Some spawners survive and return to the ocean for 1 or more years between spawning migrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steelhead exhibit two spawning migration strategies. ``Summer steelhead'' enter fresh water between May and October,
and begin their spawning migration in a sexually immature state. After several months in fresh water, summer steelhead
mature and spawn. ``Winter steelhead'' enter fresh water between November and April with well developed gonads.
In drainages with sympatric populations of summer and winter steelhead, there may or may not be temporal or spatial
separation of spawning.

Consideration as a ``Species'' Under the ESA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To qualify for listing as a threatened or endangered species, Deer Creek summer steelhead would have to be a ``species''
under the ESA. The ESA defines a ``species'' to include any ``distinct population segment of any species of vertebrate
*** which interbreeds when mature.'' NMFS published a policy (56 FR 58612, November 20, 1991) on how it will apply the
ESA ``species'' definition to Pacific salmonid species, including steelhead. This policy provides that a salmon
population will be considered distinct, and hence a species under the ESA, if it represents an evolutionarily significant
unit (ESU) of the biological species. The population must satisfy two criteria to be considered an ESU: (1) It must
be substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific population units and (2) it must represent an important
component in the evolutionary legacy of the biological species. The first criterion, reproductive isolation, need
not be absolute, but must be strong enough to permit evolutionarily important differences to accrue in different
population units. The second criterion is met if the population contributes substantially to the ecological/genetic
diversity of the species as a whole. Further guidance on the application of this policy is contained in ``Pacific salmon

In the Stillaguamish River Basin, three summer-run stocks and one winter-run steelhead stock are recognized. Run
timing is similar among the Stillaguamish River Basin summer steelhead stocks; however, spawn timing appears to
be later for Deer Creek summer steelhead than for other summer steelhead populations within the basin. Although run
timing differs between the Stillaguamish River summer and winter steelhead stocks, there is substantial overlap
in the time of spawning of the two run types.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was commonly thought that the high gradient reach of Deer Creek between approximately river kilometer 2.4 and 7.2
comprised a ``cumulative velocity barrier'' to winter steelhead (C. Kramer, Area Fish Biologist, Washington Department
of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), pers. comm., May and July 1994). However, other evidence suggests that this barrier may
not be permanent, and recent flooding may have shifted the Deer Creek bedload sufficiently to facilitate passage
of winter steelhead, thereby allowing for the possibility that summer steelhead are not reproductively isolated
from winter steelhead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, genetic studies of coastal steelhead populations have demonstrated that summer and winter steelhead
from the same stream tend to resemble one another genetically more than they resemble populations with similar run
timing from different drainages. These results suggest that summer and winter steelhead do not represent two independent
monophyletic units. Allendorf (1975) reported that coastal summer steelhead, including the Deer Creek population,
were ``genetically indistinguishable from the coastal winter run populations.'' A more recent study (Phelps

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., in press) involving a larger set of gene loci found some evidence of differentiation between summer and winter steelhead
in the Puget Sound region. The later study also found that Deer Creek summer steelhead are ``relatively distinct''
from other Puget Sound steelhead and show a higher degree of genetic similarity to winter steelhead from the Stillaguamish
and Skykomish rivers than to other summer steelhead populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variety of out-of-basin steelhead stocks have been released in the Puget Sound area, and summer steelhead of Columbia
River (Skamania stock) origin have been released in the North Fork Stillaguamish River since the 1960s (C. Kramer,
WDFW, pers. comm., May and July 1994). However, recent genetic data (Phelps

Ecological/Genetic Diversity
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Oregon, only three coastal basins have naturally-occurring summer steelhead (Siletz, Umpqua, and Rogue basins).
In contrast, all major river basins in the North Puget Sound region (Nooksack/Samish, Skagit, Stillaguamish, and
Snohomish basins) are known to have naturally-occurring summer steelhead. The discontinuous range of coastal summer
steelhead is consistent with the polyphyletic origin of this life history inferred from genetic data. However, the
Puget Sound region is (or was) conducive to the development of the summer steelhead life history, and within the Puget
Sound region, Deer Creek is not unique, or even unusual, in supporting summer-run steelhead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most common age structure for coastal steelhead from British Columbia to California is 2/2 (2 years of freshwater
residence followed by 2 years in the ocean). Specific information about the age structure of steelhead in the Puget
Sound region is limited. Based on scale samples from fish caught by anglers, Deer Creek summer steelhead are reported
to be primarily (95 percent) 2/1, with the remainder being 3/1 (C. Kramer, WDFW, pers. comm., May and July 1994). Other
Puget Sound steelhead, both summer- and winter-run, also have the 2/1 life history, but sampling has not been sufficient
to quantitatively describe age structure in these populations. According to anecdotal information, the adult size
at spawning of other summer steelhead stocks (South Fork Nooksack, Finney Creek, Sauk River, and Canyon Creek) is
similar to Deer Creek summer steelhead, and this suggests that other steelhead populations in the Puget Sound region
share the same adult body size and other life history features with Deer Creek summer steelhead.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deer Creek summer steelhead appear to be temporally and spatially isolated from other populations of summer steelhead
in the Stillaguamish River Basin. Genetic data support the hypothesis that Deer Creek summer steelhead are isolated
from other Puget Sound steelhead populations for which data are available. However, some uncertainty remains regarding
the relationship between Deer Creek summer steelhead and nearby winter-run populations, both in the Stillaguamish
River and, perhaps, in upper Deer Creek. Despite this uncertainty, NMFS has concluded, based on all available information,
that Deer Creek summer steelhead probably meet the first criterion to be an ESU_that is, substantial reproductive
isolation from other conspecific populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the genetic data show that Deer Creek summer steelhead are relatively distinct from other Puget Sound steelhead,
the genetic differences are not large in an absolute sense. Therefore, these genetic differences provide little
insight into the second ESU criterion, contribution to ecological/genetic diversity of the species as a whole. Deer
Creek summer steelhead differ from many other coastal steelhead populations in that most of the adults return after
only 1 year in the ocean, but the limited available information indicates that this is also observed in other Puget
Sound steelhead populations. NMFS found no other phenotypic or life history traits, or habitat features, that distinguish
the Deer Creek summer steelhead population from those in adjacent areas. Therefore, NMFS concludes that Deer Creek
summer steelhead do not meet the second criterion to be considered an ESU and are not, by themselves, a ``species''
under the ESA. Therefore, a proposal to list Deer Creek summer steelhead under the ESA is not warranted at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, Deer Creek summer steelhead are undoubtedly part of a larger ESU that may warrant listing under the ESA, and
NMFS will identify the extent of this ESU during its current Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California steelhead
status review (59 FR 27527, May 27, 1994). Detailed information provided in the petition for Deer Creek steelhead
will be considered during this expanded status review.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS issues a proposed rule to clarify and make minor changes to regulations implementing the North Pacific Fisheries
Research Plan (Research Plan). The proposed rule would clarify 1995 observer coverage requirements, revise the
definition of the term ``processor,'' specify who is and is not included in the definition of processor, and exempt
certain processors included in the definition from the requirement to have a Federal Processor Permit. These clarifications
will be incorporated as minor revisions to the instructions accompanying the Federal Processor Permit Application.
In addition, the definition of ``round weight'' will be revised to conform it to recent regulatory changes. This proposed
rule is consistent with the intent of the final rule implementing the Research Plan and is intended to reduce confusion
during the first year of the fee-collection program authorized under the Research Plan. NMFS expects these changes
to be effective by January 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the Research Plan became effective October 6, 1994 (59 FR 46126, September 6, 1994). A correction
subsequently was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that delayed specified parts of the implementing rule until January 1, 1995 (59 FR 51874, October 13, 1994). The purpose
for, and description of, the Research Plan are contained in the preamble to that final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has identified five areas of ambiguity and inconsistency in the final rule implementing the Research Plan. Consequently,
the following changes are proposed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The 1995 observer coverage requirements set out at &sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C) are clarified to continue to exempt
from observer coverage any vessel that delivers unsorted codends to a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The definition of ``processor'' under the Research Plan is amended to make clear NMFS' interpretation that tender
vessels are not considered processors for purposes of the Research Plan, and that fishermen who transfer fish to persons
outside of the United States are included in the definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The requirement for a Federal Processor Permit is also revised. Certain persons, although considered processors
under the definition of that term, are not required to obtain this permit. Fishermen who sell fish directly to a restaurant
or to another individual for use as bait or personal consumption or fishermen who transfer fish to a person outside
the United States are not required to have a processor permit.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The Federal Processor Permit Application (Form FPP&hyph;1) is revised to reflect changes referenced in items
2. and 3., above; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The definition of ``round weight or round-weight equivalent'' is revised to reflect the recent amendment of the
definition of this term in 50 CFR 672.2 and 675.2 (59 FR 50699, October 5, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further description of and justification for the proposed regulatory amendments listed under the first three items
follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
1995 Observer Coverage Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the effective date of the Research Plan, Amendments 13 and 18 to the FMPs for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska
and Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area respectively, authorized the Observer Plan, which set
out domestic observer coverage requirements for groundfish vessels and processors. The Observer Plan stated ``
*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;operators of catcher vessels which transport unsorted codends to a mothership are not
required to comply with this Observer Plan.'' On April 29, 1994, a final rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to revise observer coverage requirements that inadvertently deleted this exemption for catcher vessels 125 ft (38.1
m) length overall (LOA) or longer (59 FR 22133). This erroneous regulatory language was incorporated into the final
rule implementing 1995 observer coverage requirements under the Research Plan (&sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C)). The
result is that current regulations under the Research Plan require catcher vessels 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer to
carry an observer at all times, even when the vessel is delivering unsorted codends to a processor and no opportunity
exists for the observer to observe the catch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would revise regulations at &sect;677.10(a)(1)(i)(C) to correct this error by requiring a catcher
vessel 125 ft (38.1 m) LOA or longer to carry an observer 100 percent of its fishing days. The term ``fishing days'' currently
is defined at &sect;677.2 to exclude days during which a vessel only delivers unsorted codends to a processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of the Term ``Processor'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of the term ``processor,'' as published in the September 6, 1994, final rule implementing the Research
Plan, includes any person, except a restaurant, who receives fish from fishermen for commercial purposes. The final
rule implementing the Research Plan added the exclusion for restaurants, but indicated the intent was that all landings
of fish harvested in Research Plan fisheries be accounted for so that fees may be assessed based on the amount of fish
landed and an annually specified fee per pound. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the definition published in the September 6, 1994, final rule, a tender vessel receiving fish from fishermen
for delivery to a shoreside processing facility could be considered a processor. Inclusion of tender vessels as processors
for purposes of the Research Plan was not the intent of the final rule implementing the Research Plan and is unnecessary
to account for landings of fish. Accordingly, NMFS proposes to revise the definition of ``processor'' so that it is
clear that tender vessels are not included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of processor in the September 6, 1994, final rule also inadvertently excluded fishermen who transport
fish to persons outside the United States. To date, the amount of fish transferred by fishermen to persons outside
the United States is believed to be small. However, the halibut and sablefish Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program
scheduled for implementation in 1995 (58 FR 59375, November 9, 1993) is anticipated to result in increased deliveries
of these species to persons in Canada and elsewhere outside the United States. Such deliveries could result in unreported
landings. Consequently, NMFS proposes to revise the definition of ``processor'' to clarify that these fishermen
are considered processors so that they are held accountable for payment of billed fee assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exemption of Certain Processors From Applying for a Processor Permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule implementing the Research Plan requires that all processors of fish from Research Plan fisheries must
have a Federal Processor Permit. This requirement is reasonable for those processors that anticipate participation
in a Research Plan fishery, but is not necessary for a fisherman who delivers fish outside of the United States or sells
fish directly to restaurants or to individuals for use as bait or personal consumption. Furthermore, the fisherman
may not be the owner of the catcher vessel. Vessel owners often cannot anticipate the number or identity of operators
of their vessels during a given fishing year. As a result, individual fishermen who are processors under the Research
Plan may be difficult to identify until after an Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&amp;G) fish ticket or other
documentation of landing has been submitted. Therefore, this proposed rule would make it explicit that these processors
are exempt from such requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS further notes its intent that the following sections of the Observer Plan still are effective during the first
year of the Research Plan (1995): (1) Standards of observer conduct (attachment number 3); and (2) the description,
specifications, and work statement for certified domestic observer contractors, including conflict of interest
standards for NMFS-certified observers and contractors and conditions for contractor and observer certification
revocation (attachment number 4). Copies of the Observer Plan dated May 1994 are available from NMFS (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the first year of the Research Plan, standards and criteria for conduct, certification, conflict of interest,
and revocation of certification of observers and observer contractors will be included as part of the contractual
arrangements between NMFS and observer contractors.

This proposed rule includes minor revisions to the instructions accompanying the collection of information approved
by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB control number 0648&hyph;0206 (Processor Permit Application). No new
information is collected, but the number of persons required to comply with this collection-of-information requirement
is reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council, NMFS, and the ADF&amp;G prepared a final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
as part of the Regulatory Impact Review prepared for the Research Plan. A copy of this analysis is available from the
Council (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS finds that this proposed action should be implemented as soon as possible so that clear instructions may be sent
out to the industry that reflect what will be in place for the 1995 fee collection program authorized under the Research
Plan. Delay in implementing the proposed revisions would create unnecessary confusion within the fishing industry
concerning implementation of the Research Plan during 1995. NMFS is providing a 15-day comment period to expedite
final action while allowing an opportunity for public comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before
introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically
engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures
for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit
for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request by the petitioner, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the
antidumping finding on replacement parts for self-propelled bituminous paving equipment from Canada. The review
period is September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise,
the Allatt Paving Division of Ingersoll-Rand Canada Inc. (Allatt). We preliminarily determine the dumping margin
for this period to be 11.04 percent. We invite interested parties to comment on these preliminary results.

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating United States price (USP), the Department used purchase price (PP) and exporter's sales price (ESP),
as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act. For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importation
into the United States, we based the United States price on PP, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Tariff Act.
Where sales to the first unrelated purchaser occurred after importation into the United States, we based USP on ESP,
in accordance with section 772(c) of the Tariff Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PP and ESP were based on the packed, f.o.b. prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made adjustments,
where applicable, for brokerage charges, U.S. and foreign inland freight, U.S. duties, and discounts. For ESP sales,
we also deducted commissions to unrelated parties, credit, and indirect selling expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating FMV, the Department used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, because sufficient
quantities of such or similar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis for comparison. Home market
price was based on the packed, f.o.b. company warehouse price in the home market. Where applicable, we made adjustments
for discounts, inland freight, credit expenses, commissions, advertising expenses, packing expenses, and differences
in merchandise.

 13, F3d 398 (CAFC 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to its inherent
power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. We instead will adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale
(COS) provision of 19 CFR 353.56 and the ESP offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), as appropriate, in the
manner described below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When USP is based on PP, we only adjust for home market movement charges through the COS provision of 19 CFR 353.56. Under
this adjustment, we capture only direct selling expenses, which include post-sale movement expenses and, in some
circumstances, pre-sale movement expenses. Specifically, we will treat pre-sale movement expenses as direct expenses
if those expenses are directly related to the home market sales of the merchandise under consideration. Moreover,
in order to determine whether pre-sale movement expenses are direct, the Department will examine the respondent's
pre-sale warehousing expenses, since the pre-sale movement charges incurred in positioning the merchandise at
the warehouse are, for analytical purposes, inextricably linked to pre-sale warehousing expenses. If the pre-sale
warehousing constitutes an indirect expense, the expense involved in getting the merchandise to the warehouse also
must be indirect; conversely, a direct pre-sale warehousing expense necessarily implies a direct pre-sale movement
expense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When USP is based on ESP, the Department makes COS adjustments for movement expenses in the same manner as in PP situations.
Additionally, under the ESP offset provision set forth in 19 CFR 353.56(b) (1) and (2), we adjust for any pre-sale movement
charges which are treated as indirect selling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the present case, because the company's warehousing expense could not be tied directly to either a particular customer
or sales of the subject merchandise, it was reported and was treated as an indirect selling expense. Further, no pre-sale
movement costs were claimed. Therefore, no COS adjustment has been made for these costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the ESP offset, we deducted indirect selling expenses from foreign market value in an amount up to the amount
of indirect selling expenses incurred in the U.S. market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When making comparisons with PP sales, we deducted home market commissions to unrelated parties, home market credit
expenses, home market advertising, home market packing, and home market post-sale inland freight from FMV and added
U.S. commissions, U.S. credit expenses, U.S. advertising, and U.S. packing to FMV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those products sold in the United States for which there were no sales of identical or similar home market models,
we calculated FMV based on CV in accordance with section 773(e) of the Tariff Act. We calculated constructed value
by adding material and fabrication costs, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A), profit, and
U.S. packing. Since actual SG&amp;A expenses were greater than the statutory minimum of ten percent of the sum of materials
and fabrication costs, we used actual SG&amp;A expenses. We used the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit.
No other adjustments were claimed or allowed.

Preliminary Results of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of our review, we preliminarily determine that the margin for Allatt is 11.04 percent for the period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1, 1990 through August 31, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parties to the proceeding may request disclosure and interested parties may request a hearing not later than ten days
after publication of this notice. Interested parties may submit written arguments in case briefs on these preliminary
results within 30 days of the date of publication. Rebuttal briefs, limited to arguments raised in case briefs, may
be submitted seven days after the time limit for filing the case brief. Any hearing, if requested, will be held seven
days after the scheduled date for submission of rebuttal briefs. Copies of case briefs and rebuttal briefs must be
served on interested parties in accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(e). Representatives of parties to the proceeding may
request disclosure of proprietary information under administrative protective order no later than 10 days after
the representative's client or employer becomes a party to the proceeding, but in no event later than the date the case
briefs are due. The Department will publish the final results of the administrative review, including the results
of its analysis of issues raised in any case or rebuttal brief or at a hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Individual differences between United States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated
above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon publication of the final results of this
administrative review for all shipments of the subject merchandise from Canada entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption on or after the publication date, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit
rate for the reviewed company will be that established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for
merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but covered in previous reviews or
the original less-than-fair-value investigation, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific
rate published in the final determination covering the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered
in this review, previous reviews, or the original investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will
be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in the final results of this review, or if not covered in
this review, the most recent review period or the original investigation; and (4) the ``all other'' rate will be 20.12
percent. On May 25, 1993, the CIT in

839 F. Supp. 864 (CIT 1993), decided that once an ``all other'' rate is established, it can only be changed through an
administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions it is appropriate
to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the original investigation (or that rate as amended for correction
of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders as the ``all others''
rate for cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proceedings governed by antidumping findings, unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the
Treasury less-than-fair-value investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the
``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative review published by the Department
(or that rate as amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation) as the ``all others'' rate for
the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. Because this proceeding
is governed by an antidumping finding, and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury less-than-fair-value
investigation, the Department has determined that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate of 20.12 percent
established in the first final results published by the Department in the

of the next administrative review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of
antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, as amended (19 U.S.C.
1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (13 months)
from April 1, 1995 to April 30, 1996, is estimated at $388,898. The total Federal amount is $330,563 and is composed
of $322,500 plus the Audit Fee amount of $8,063. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15%, $58,335 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $388,898. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. For those applicants who are not incumbent
organizations or who are incumbents that have experienced closure due to a break in service, a 30-day start-up period
will be added to their first budget period, making it a 13-month award. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities..
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (13 months)
from April 1, 1995 to April 30, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15%, $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. For those applicants who are not incumbent
organizations or who are incumbents that have experienced closure due to a break in service, a 30-day start-up period
will be added to their first budget period, making it a 13-month award. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: the knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered programmatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and
responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of points
received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further
the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under
prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point
score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be
conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contingent upon the availability of Federal funds, the cost of performance for the first budget period (13 months)
from April 1, 1995 to April 30, 1996, is estimated at $198,971. The total Federal amount is $169,125 and is composed
of $165,000 plus the Audit Fee amount of $4,125. The application must include a minimum cost share of 15%, $29,846 in
non-federal (cost-sharing) contributions for a total project cost of $198,971. Cost-sharing contributions may
be in the form of cash, client fees, third party in-kind contributions, non-cash applicant contributions or combinations
thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. For those applicants who are not incumbent
organizations or who are incumbents that have experienced closure due to a break in service, a 30-day start-up period
will be added to their first budget period, making it a 13-month award. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The knowledge, background and/or capabilities of the
firm and its staff in addressing the needs of the business community in general and, specifically, the special needs
of minority businesses, individuals and organizations (45 points), the resources available to the firm in providing
business development services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the
work requirements included in the application (25 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance
(20 points). An application must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category
to be considered pro-grammatically acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable
and responsive will then be evaluated by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number of
points received, the demonstrated responsibility of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to
further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance
under prior Federal awards may result in an application not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest
point score will not necessarily receive the award. Periodic reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will
be conducted to determine if funding for the project should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion
of MBDA based on such factors as the MBDC's performance, the availability of funds and Agency priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions.
To assist in this effort, the MBDC may charge client fees for services rendered. Fees may range from $10 to $60 per hour
based on the gross receipts of the client's business.

meet cost-sharing requirements; unsatisfactory performance of the MBDC work requirements; and reporting inaccurate
or inflated claims of client assistance. Such inaccurate or inflated claims may be deemed illegal and punishable
by law.

 Section 3517 of the Paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U. S. C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provide interested
Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB may amend
or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval process
would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially interfere
with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information Resources
Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior to submission
of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following: (1) Type
of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection;
(4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public
comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Patrick J. Sherrill at the address
specified above.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a minor license for the existing, unlicensed Fort Dodge Mill Dam Hydroelectric Project, located
on the Des Moines River, Webster County, Iowa, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project.
In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the existing project and has
concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate mitigation measures, would not constitute a major federal
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, Room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.

Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell,
Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix
Project No. 11346 to all comments. For further information, please contact Mary Golato, Environmental Coordinator,

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new minor license for the existing Swift Creek Project, located on the Swift Creek, near the town
of Afton, in Lincoln County, Wyoming, and has prepared a final environmental assessment (EA) for the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final EA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the

measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.

Take notice that on November 10, 1994, Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), tendered for filing revised tariff
sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1. The new tariff sheets are filed in accordance with the November
2, 1994 letter order in this proceeding. In the November 2, order, the Commission conditioned acceptance of CIG's
October 3, 1994 filing on a compliance filing by CIG to reflect the tariff modifications approved by the Commission
in its September 14, 1994 order in Docket No. RP94&hyph;342 (68 FERC (CCH) &para;61,295). CIG has filed revisions
of the tariff sheets listed in Appendix A of the order in connection with this directive with one exception. Second
Revised Sheet No. 101 in CIG's October 3 filing already reflected the modifications approved by the Commission in
Docket No. RP94&hyph;342.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance filing also abides by the Commission directive in the November 2 order in connection with the provision
allowing CIG to permit (on a case-by-case basis) storage customers under Rate Schedules NNT&hyph;1, NNT&hyph;2
and FS&hyph;1 to exceed the limitation on end-of-season gas inventory. The revised tariff sheets indicate that CIG
will grant waivers on a non-discriminatory basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, CIG submitted for filing the following tariff sheets to become effective on November 1, 1994:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application to construct and operate the proposed
Sheep Mountain Pumped Storage Project, FERC Project No. 11367. The off-stream project would be located approximately
19 miles south of Las Vegas in Clark County, Nevada. This proposed project would involve federal lands managed by the
Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff has determined that licensing this project would constitute a major federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the FERC staff intends to direct a third-party contractor
in the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the hydroelectric project in accordance with the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (Pub. L. 91&hyph;190. 42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347, January 1,
1970, as amended by Pub. L. 94&hyph;52, July 3, 1975, Pub. L. 94&hyph;83, August 9, 1925, and Pub. L. 97&hyph;258, &sect;4(b),
September 13, 1982). This EIS will objectively consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts
of the project and reasonable alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis.
BLM will be a cooperating agency on the EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS (DEIS) will be circulated for review and comment by all interested parties, and FERC will hold a public
meeting for the DEIS. FERC and BLM will consider and respond to comments received on the DEIS in the Final EIS. The FERC
staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching
its final licensing decision. BLM will use the information in the EIS to make its decision on issuing a right-of-way
grant for the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping: Affected landowners, concerned citizens, special interest groups, local governments, and any other interested
parties are invited to comment on the scope of the environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS. Scoping
will help ensure that all significant issues related to this proposal are addressed in the EIS, and also will identify
significant or potentially significant impacts that may result from the proposed project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC will conduct two scoping meetings on November 29 and 30, 1994. A scoping meeting oriented towards the public
will begin at 7:30 p.m. on November 29, 1994, at the Clark County Library located at 1401 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas,
Nevada. A scoping meeting oriented towards the agencies will begin at 8:30 a.m. on November 30, 1994, at the BLM offices
located at 4765 Vegas Drive, Las Vegas, Nevada. (The public and the agencies may attend either or both meetings, however.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objectives: At the scoping meetings FERC staff will (1) Identify preliminary environmental issues related to the
proposed project; (2) identify preliminary resource issues that are not important and do not require detailed analysis;
(3) identify reasonable alternatives to be addressed in the EIS; (4) solicit from the meeting participants all available
information, especially quantified data, on the resource issues; and (5) encourage statements from experts and
the public on issues that should be analyzed in the EIS, including points of view in opposition to, or in support of,
the staffs' preliminary views.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures: The meetings will be recorded by a court reporter and all statements (oral and written) thereby become
a part of the official record of the Commission proceedings for the Blue Diamond South Project. Individuals presenting
statements at the meetings will be asked to clearly identify themselves for the record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To help focus discussions at the scoping meeting, FERC will mail a Scoping Document I, outlining subject areas to be
addressed in the EIS, to agencies and interested individuals on the project mailing list. Copies of the scoping document
will also be available at the scoping meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons choosing not to speak at the meetings, but who have views on the issues or information relevant to the issues,

Take notice that on November 8, 1994, South Georgia Natural Gas Company (South Georgia) tendered for filing a one-year
status report as required by the Commission's August 23, 1993 order in Dockets Nos. RS92&hyph;49, et al. South Georgia
states that the filing reports on (1) South Georgia's progress in implementing intraday nominations, and (2) the
operation of its penalty waiver provision during the first year of operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Georgia states that on November 8, 1994, it also made a transportation tariff filing in a separate docket which
would implement intra-day nomination procedures effective December 5, 1994. South Georgia's report also discusses
the systemwide penalty waivers granted during its first year and concludes that the waiver provision operated effectively
to avoid penalizing shippers who were trying to take appropriate actions, but incurred penalties as a result of late
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
South Georgia states that copies of the filing will be served on parties to Docket Nos. RS92&hyph;49, et al., and all
shippers and interested states commissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211

should be filed on or before December 6, 1994. Protests will not be considered by the Commission in determining the
parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In December 1993, Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposed to change the way it markets power and energy
produced by the Provo River Project (PRP) and to include PRP as one of the Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated
Projects). During the comment period on the proposal, comments were received which indicated that customers of Western's
Integrated Projects would not support inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. Subsequently, on July 11,
1994, Western announced its intent to modify its original proposal and market this power and energy independent of
the Integrated Projects. Western has determined that capacity and energy produced by the PRP will be allocated to
those members of Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah Municipal Power Agency (UMPA) located
in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. ICPA and UMPA are hereinafter referred to as the Contractors. Power will be allocated
to the Contractors proportional to their load. Separate power sales contracts will be offered to each of the Contractors.
The term of the contracts will extend until September 30, 2008. Contractors will pay all of the annual powerplant expenses
of the PRP including an amount to assist the Provo River Water Users Association (Water Users) repayment of the United
States original investment in the PRP. In return, the Contractors will receive all of the marketable output of the
PRP. Service to the Contractor's will begin upon execution of the electric service contracts.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice dated December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65180&hyph;65189), Western proposed to include the PRP with the Integrated
Projects and to market the power and energy produced by the PRP to members of ICPA and UMPA within a marketing area comprised
of Utah and Wasatch Counties, Utah. Western accepted comments on its proposal until January 12, 1994. A public information/comment/scoping
meeting was held in Spanish Fork, Utah, on January 4, 1994. As a result of comments received, at both the meeting and
in writing, Western revised its proposed marketing plan for the PRP in a

 notice dated July 11, 1994 (59 FR 35334&hyph;35337). Western accepted comments on its revised proposal until August
10, 1994. Based on the response, Western has decided that the proposal shall become effective upon execution of the
electric service contracts.

Marketing Issues. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments on Western's revised proposal were received from six commentors. These included UMPA, ICPA, Colorado River
Energy Distributors Association (CREDA), the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Water Users, and the Central
Utah Water Conservancy District (CUWCD). Commentors were supportive of Western's revised proposal. The following
addresses the issues that were identified and explains how they were resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Issue: Inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: This issue had been included in the original proposal but was objected to by CREDA because the payment
of power revenues to assist the Water Users repayment obligation would help repay investment in municipal and industrial
water. In response to this objection, Western revised its proposal to market the PRP independently from the Integrated
Projects. UMPA, ICPA, and CREDA commented that they support Western marketing the PRP independent from the Integrated
Projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: Western will market the output of the PRP through contractual arrangements separate from the Integrated
Projects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. Issue: Marketing area for the PRP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: Western proposed to define the marketing area for the PRP as Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah, essentially
the drainage of the Provo River. Two entities, Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (Weber Basin) and the city of
Bountiful (Bountiful), Utah, claimed that since water was diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River above
powerplants that were controlled by them, they were entitled to an allocation of energy from the PRP to compensate
them for energy lost because of this diversion. Western, through Reclamation, was able to demonstrate that water
rights for the Provo River diversion predated water rights held by Weber Basin and Bountiful for generation. Neither
Weber Basin nor Bountiful commented on the revised proposal. In responding to the revised proposal, ICPA was the only
entity to comment on this issue. ICPA supported establishing the Provo River Drainage as the marketing area for the
PRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: PRP power will be marketed within Wasatch and Utah Counties, Utah. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III. Issue: Marketing the output of the Deer Creek Powerplant to preference entities located in the marketing area.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: Marketing of the PRP production to preference entities in the marketing area was supported by the commentors.
All of these entities are members of either ICPA or UMPA, organizations established as purchasing agents for Federal
power. Heber City, Lehi, Springville, Strawberry Electric Service District, and Payson are members of ICPA. Provo,
Salem, and Spanish Fork are members of UMPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: Western will offer firm power sales contracts to ICPA and UMPA to purchase PRP power and energy in behalf
of their members in the marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV. Issue: Relationship of ICPA and UMPA to their members concerning the allocation of PRP power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: In its comments, UMPA requested that language be included in its power sales contract which would clarify
the relationship of UMPA and its members concerning the allocation of PRP power. If a member withdraws from either
organization, the allocation of Federal power stays with the member, not UMPA or ICPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: Western will include language in both UMPA and ICPA's contracts to clarify the relationship between the
members and the organization. The language will state that if a member withdraws from either organization, the percentage
entitlement of PRP power remains with the member and not with UMPA or ICPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
V. Issue: Payment of all of the PRP's annual costs including an amount for the Water Users repayment obligation by the
Contractors in return for receiving all of the marketable energy produced by the plant each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: Generation from Deer Creek Powerplant has varied considerably from year to year. Without the Integrated
Projects to back up Deer Creek, it is very difficult to determine the amounts of firm and nonfirm energy and capacity
that should be used as marketable energy in ratesetting. Basing rates on average generation could result in surplus
revenues in some years, and deficits in others. The proposal which was supported by UMPA, ICPA, CUWCD, and CREDA would
eliminate the need to identify a specific rate for PRP power and would still allow Contractors to take full advantage
of PRP generation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decision: PRP power sales contracts will include provisions for Contractors to pay all of the PRP's annual operation,
maintenance, and replacement (OM&amp;R) expenses as well as an annual payment to Reclamation for application toward
the Water Users' annual repayment obligation. In return, the Contractors will receive the total annual output of
marketable energy produced by the Deer Creek Powerplant. Every year Western will prepare a power repayment study
(PRS) that will identify the OM&amp;R costs to be collected in the upcoming year.

VI. Issue: Effect of operation of Jordanelle Reservoir on Deer Creek generation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: Jordanelle Reservoir is intended to store surplus water from high flow years and the winter flows of the
Provo River and release it in dry years and in the late summer. Prior to Jordanelle, the winter flow of the Provo River
was released from Deer Creek through the generators. Under the Deer Creek/Jordanelle Operating Agreement, only
enough water to meet minimum stream flow requirements will be released. The result is that winter generation is greatly
reduced. However, there is the potential for generation to be enhanced when the water is released during the summer
months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reducing winter generation levels creates a problem in providing enough energy to repay PacifiCorp for its foregone
generation when the Water Users are operating under the December 20, 1938, Power Contract (1938 Contract) (see discussion
below under section II of Marketing Criteria). In the Deer Creek/Jordanelle Operating Agreement, the CUWCD agreed
to make up any shortfalls in repaying PacifiCorp. On the other hand, CUWCD releases should augment summer generation
levels. CUWCD has requested that this energy be applied toward the deficit it creates in the winter. Both Reclamation
and the Water Users support this position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussions have been held with the Contractors, and they have agreed that the increase in summer energy attributable
to CUWCD releases should be available to offset reductions in the winter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: A separate agreement among Western, Reclamation, CUWCD, PacifiCorp, the Water Users, and the Contractors
will be developed which will provide for the increase in summer energy to offset deficits in winter generation. Negotiations
are continuing on the methodology used to verify the impact to generation and on the best method to deliver the energy
to PacifiCorp. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VII. Issue: Application of net power revenues from the Contractors toward the obligation of the Water Users to repay
the Federal Government for its investment in the PRP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: Several commentors, including UMPA, ICPA, Reclamation, and the Water Users, commented on this issue.
Both the Water Users and Reclamation support the claim that there is a contractual obligation for this payment and
document the level of annual payments as $102,243.80 through 2008, and $76,520 thereafter until the obligation is
liquidated. UMPA stated that it supports the level of the annual payments. ICPA stated that it supports the payment
through 2008 but objected to the payment beyond that date. However, the Water Users and Reclamation have demonstrated
that the contractual obligation extends until the Water Users' repayment obligation is liquidated. Reclamation
has documented that the net revenues available to the Water Users beyond 2008 should be $76,520 annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: Include provisions in the power sales contracts which would pay $102,243.80 through 2008 toward the Water
Users' repayment obligation. Any contracts for the sale of power thereafter would include annual assistance payments
of $76,520 until the obligation is liquidated. After the obligation is repaid, the net revenue of $76,520 will need
to be paid to Western to be disposed of as Congress directs.

VIII. Issue: Term of Contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: UMPA, Reclamation, and the Water Users commented that the term of the power sales contracts should be
extended long enough to ensure that the obligation to use net power revenues to assist the Water Users is completed.
Reclamation stated that this should be through FY 2032 to ensure that the Water Users' contract will be paid off. Both
Reclamation and the Water Users have established that there is a contractual obligation that binds the Federal Government
to make surplus revenue from the sale of power available to help repay the Water Users' obligation. Also, both assert
that commitments were made by Reclamation that this amount should be $76,520 per year after 2008. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: Contractors will be given the option of extending the contracts at least 3 years before the contracts expire.
Adjustments to contract provisions could be made at that time, including provisions for new customers. The contracts
will provide for annual payments of $102,243.80 through 2008; extended contracts would include annual assistance
payments of $76,520 thereafter to be made by the Contractors to Reclamation for application to the Water Users' annual
repayment obligation until the Water Users' repayment obligation is liquidated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IX. Issue: Power revenues should not be used to subsidize the repayment of municipal and industrial water developments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: ICPA noted that it supported the position of CREDA that power revenues should not be used to subsidize
the repayment of municipal and industrial water developments. As discussed above, both Reclamation and the Water
Users have demonstrated that even though a majority of the water developed by the PRP is used for municipal and industrial
uses, the contracts between the Water Users and Reclamation establish a commitment for net power revenues to be used
to help the Water Users meet their annual repayment requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision: Western's contract should be consistent with the provisions of the contracts between Reclamation and
the Water Users. The obligation to provide for payments to the Water Users until their repayment obligation is liquidated
will be reflected in the contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
X. Issue: What happens in the event of a major equipment failure at the Deer Creek Powerplant? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discussion: Reclamation commented that Western's proposal does not address what would happen in the event of a major
equipment failure at the Deer Creek Powerplant, and that ``the contract terms should be sufficiently flexible to
address this and other significant issues.'' Given the age of the powerplant, it is necessary to take this into consideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decision: Include language in the power sales contracts which provides that in the event extraordinary replacement
costs are incurred at the Deer Creek Powerplant, the payment thereof shall take precedence over the application of
net power revenues toward the Water User's repayment obligation, and may result in a reduction or deferral of such
payment until the replacement costs are fully recovered. This language has been agreed to by the Water Users and is
included in the Deer Creek/Jordanelle Operating Agreement.

I. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Congress granted to the Secretary of Energy, acting by and through Western's Administrator, the authority to market
Federal power. In response to requests from UMPA and ICPA to receive power produced by the PRP, Western has examined
the merits of marketing the PRP resource. Western believes these marketing criteria will benefit the Contractors,
the Water Users, Reclamation, and Western. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marketable Resource.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 1938 Contract among Reclamation, the Water Users, the Weber River Water Users Association, and PacifiCorp provides
for diversion of water from the Weber River into the Provo River for storage in Deer Creek Reservoir and for use by the
Water Users. Because PacifiCorp operated generating units on the Weber River below the point of diversion to the Provo
River, PacifiCorp's ability to generate was reduced when water was diverted. The 1938 Contract provides for PacifiCorp
to receive all of the electrical generation of the PRP during the period of time that water is diverted. This means that
for up to 6 months, from October 15 to April 15 of each year, there may be no marketable energy generated by the PRP. Historically,
however, marketable energy has averaged 23,000,000 kilowatthours (kWh), with 15,000,000 kWh generated during
summer months, and the remaining 8,000,000 kWh from winter surplus energy. Typically, about 3,000,000 kWh are available
in each of the three peak summer months of June, July, and August; approximately 1,000,000 kWh are available in April,
2,500,000 kWh in May, and another 2,500,000 kWh in September.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishment of Rate Methodology.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Western, through a separate public process, will establish a rate methodology for the PRP. Western will prepare an
annual PRS which will identify the anticipated OM&amp;R expenses. Minor replacements and additions shall be included
in the annual OM&amp;R expenses. However, if major replacements or additions which cost more than $5,000 are needed,
the Contractors will be given the option of financing their individual share of the cost or of having the cost capitalized
at the Department of Energy's current interest rate and amortized over the life of the replacement or addition. Rather
than set a specific rate for power and energy, the Contractors will pay the PRP's total annual powerplant expenses
in return for the total marketable PRP production. Each will pay its proportional share of the OM&amp;R expenses identified
in the PRS in 12 monthly installments. In addition to the annual OM&amp;R expenses, before January 1 of each year, each
Contractor will pay its share of net power revenues to Reclamation to be applied toward the Water Users' annual payment.
Through 2008, the total annual payment will be $102,243.80. Thereafter, until the Water Users' obligation is liquidated,
the total annual payment will be $76,520. After the Water Users' repayment obligation is liquidated, the annual payment
of $76,520 will continue to be paid to Western to be disposed of as Congress directs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marketing Area.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because of the size of the resource, Western has limited marketing of this resource to preference entities within
the drainage area of the Provo River. All of the eligible utilities are members of ICPA and UMPA and are located in Utah
and Wasatch Counties, Utah. The cities of Heber City, Lehi, Payson, Springville, and the Strawberry Electric Service
District (Strawberry) are members of ICPA. The cities of Provo, Salem, and Spanish Fork are members of UMPA. It is anticipated
that marketing of the PRP resource to these Contractors would assure that each would receive a beneficial amount of
power.

V. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Class of Service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 PRP generation is dependant upon water releases that are dictated by minimum stream flow requirements and the Water
Users' needs. No load following ability exists. Since April 1, 1994, the PRP has been included in Western's Upper Colorado/Missouri
Basin control area. With the PRP in Western's control area, Western is able to enhance the usability of the product
and to allow it to be scheduled, even though it has no control over PRP generation. Western provides control area and
regulating services for several other customers and has a developed methodology to share the expenses of operating
a control area and providing for regulating capacity. The PRP will be required to pay for its share of these services.
These costs will be included in the PRS as an operating expense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy will be scheduled to the Contractors in megawatts in accordance with anticipated generation levels from the
PRP. When variations occur, the hourly schedules will be adjusted to reflect actual operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western will maintain an energy deviation account between the PRP and the Integrated Projects. At the end of each year,
an accounting of scheduled and generated energy will be made. Differences between the two projects will be made up
by adding to or subtracting from the following year's schedules to the Contractors. The Contractors will be responsible
for reserves in accordance with Inland Power Pool requirements.

VI. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Resource Allocation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Western will allocate PRP resources in proportion to the historical sales of each of the ICPA and UMPA members. UMPA
members serve approximately 70 percent of the load in the marketing area, while ICPA members serve approximately
30 percent. Proportional allocation of the PRP's average annual output of 23,000,000 kWh would mean UMPA members
could expect an average of 16,100,000 kWh and 3,500 kilowatts (kW) of contingent capacity, and ICPA members could
expect an average of 6,900,000 kWh and 1,500 kW of contingent capacity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), each agency, when publishing a proposed rule, is further required to prepare and make available for public comment
an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to describe the impact of the rule on small entities. Western has determined
that (1) this rulemaking relates to services offered by Western and, therefore, is not a rule within the purview of
the Act, and (2) the impacts of an allocation from Western would not cause an adverse economic impact to such entities.

DETERMINATION UNDER EXECUTIVE ORDER 12866: DOE has determined this is not a significant regulatory action because
it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $5 million in fiscal year 1995 grant/cooperative agreement
funds under the Pollution Prevention Incentives for States (PPIS) grant program. The purpose of this program is to
support State, Tribal, and regional programs that address the reduction or elimination of pollution across all environmental
media: Air, land, and water. Grants/cooperative agreements will be awarded under the authority of the Pollution
Prevention Act of 1990.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately $30 million has been awarded to over 100 State, Tribal, and regional organizations under EPA's multimedia
pollution prevention grant program, since its inception in 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (the Act) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) was enacted, establishing
as national policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Section 6603 of
the Act defines source reduction as any practice that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise
released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants,
or contaminants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA further defines pollution prevention as the use of other practices, that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants
through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or protection of natural
resources by conservation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6605 of the Act authorizes EPA to make matching grants to States to promote the use of source reduction techniques
by businesses. In evaluating grant applications, the Act directs EPA to consider whether the proposed State programs
will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Make technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities,
including funding for experts to provide on-site technical advice and to assist in the development of source reduction
plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Provide training in source reduction techniques.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this grant making authority, the Act authorizes EPA to establish a national source reduction clearinghouse,
expands EPA's authority to collect data to better track source reduction activities, and requires EPA to report periodically
to Congress on EPA's progress in implementing the Act. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Availability of FY 95 Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With this publication, EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $5 million in grant/cooperative agreement
funds for FY 1995. The Agency has delegated grant making authority to the EPA Regional offices which formally transfers
the decision-making and awarding process for the PPIS grants to the Regions. Regional offices have responsibility
for the solicitation of interest, screening of proposals, and the actual selection of awards. This seventh round
of awards reflects a more direct and active Regional role in determining FY '95 awardees. PPIS grant guidance will
be developed separately by each Regional program and will be provided to all applicants along with any supplemental
information the Regions may wish to provide. However, in addition to Regional guidelines, all applicants must address
the national requirements listed under unit III.3. of this document. Interested applicants should contact their
Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator for more information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Act, eligible applicants for purposes of funding under this grant program include the 50 States,
the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of
the United States, any agency or instrumentality of a State including State universities and all Federally-recognized
Indian tribes. For convenience, the term ``State'' in this notice refers to all eligible applicants. Local governments,
private universities, private non-profit entities, private businesses, and individuals are not eligible. These
organizations excluded from applying directly are encouraged to work with eligible applicants in developing proposals
that include them as participants in the projects. EPA strongly encourages this type of cooperative arrangement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The number assigned to the PPIS program is 66.708 (formerly 66.900). Organizations receiving pollution prevention
grant funds are required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the Federal government will provide half of the total allowable cost of the project, the State half of
the total allowable cost of the project. A grant request for $100,000 would support a total allowable project cost
of $200,000, with the State also providing $100,000. State contributions may include dollars, in-kind goods and
services and/or third party contributions.

Tribal, or local multimedia pollution prevention programs. EPA specifically seeks to build State pollution prevention
capabilities or to test, at the State level, innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. Funds
awarded under the PPIS grant program must be used to support pollution prevention programs that address the transfer
of potentially harmful pollutants across all environmental media: Air, water, and land. Programs should reflect
comprehensive and coordinated pollution prevention planning and implementation efforts State- or Region-wide
and where appropriate seek to address State environmental justice issues. States might focus on, for example:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Developing multimedia pollution prevention activities, including but not limited to: Providing direct technical
assistance to businesses; collecting and analyzing data to target outreach and technical assistance opportunities;
conducting outreach activities; developing measures to determine progress in pollution prevention; and identifying
regulatory and non-regulatory barriers and incentives to pollution prevention and developing plans to implement
solutions, where possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Institutionalizing multimedia pollution prevention as an environmental management priority, establishing
prevention goals, developing strategies to meet those goals, and integrating the pollution prevention ethic within
both governmental and non-governmental institutions of the State or region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Initiating demonstration projects that test and support innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Federal government has extended and broadened its support of organizations that supply technical assistance,
training and information to businesses. Examples of this include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Resources from the Department of Commerce's National Institute for Standards and Technology to support the Manufacturing
Extension Partnerships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Resources from the Small Business Administration and EPA to support the technology assistance programs of the
Small Business Development Centers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Resources from the Department of Energy to the industrial sector to assist in commercializing technologies developed
from the national labs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Resources from EPA and State programs that support the Clean Air Act Small Business Assistance Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a growing emergence of business assistance organizations established within States to address the vast
array of environmental concerns. Consequently, as a means to provide substantive support of pollution prevention,
EPA is eager to ensure that the PPIS grants will add to the success and sustainability of these State pollution prevention
programs. Therefore, it is important to clarify the role of the State pollution prevention program in terms of its
relationship to its intended customers and to the other organizations which provide similar environmental assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this, EPA has developed three mandatory requirements which must be addressed by all eligible applicants.
Proposals that do not address these national requirements, even though they adequately address the Regional criteria,
will not be considered eligible for funding. In the narrative of the grant application, the following three requirements
must be addressed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Briefly define the capacity and potential of the State program as a provider of pollution prevention assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Identify other organizations at the regional, State and local level, that provide similar environmental assistance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Describe the coordination capabilities with the identified environmental assistance programs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Briefly describe an approach to working with, leveraging and complementing the identified organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Address the barriers for coordination with these organizations and options to overcome the identified barriers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals accepted for review under this program must qualify as pollution prevention as defined by EPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Brownfield Economic Redevelopment Initiative is founded on the belief that ``economic development and environmental
protection must go hand in hand,'' (Carol Browner, Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency, Announcing
the Cleveland Brownfields Pilot on November 8, 1993). EPA's Brownfields Initiative is an organized commitment to
help communities revitalize abandoned contaminated properties, and to thereby eliminate potential health risks
and restore economic vitality to areas where these properties exist. Three national pilot projects already have
been awarded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With as many as 100,000 sites potentially requiring evaluation under federal or state Superfund programs, hundreds
of local, state, and tribal governments and their citizens inevitably will have to deal with contaminated properties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``polluter pays'' principle, fundamental to Superfund's success in deterring the creation of new contaminated
sites, has caused public and private investors to shy away from buying and cleaning up land which may be contaminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fear of that liability drives investors toward undeveloped ``greenfields.'' The result can be a diminished supply
of pristine land and economic decline in industrial and urban centers. Both are detrimental to communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Brownfields Pilots (to be funded at $200,000 each over two years) will test redevelopment models, direct special
efforts toward removing regulatory barriers without sacrificing protectiveness, and facilitate coordinated
efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. EPA will develop a coordinated federal strategy to help initiate
a significant national effort to clean up and redevelop brownfields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objectives of the initiative are: to build the capacity of affected and interested parties to shape how contaminated
sites are cleaned up and productively reused; to stimulate a national search for innovative ways to overcome the current
obstacles to the reuse of contaminated properties; and to coalesce federal, state, and municipal efforts to examine
new approaches to achieving cleanup and reuse; and to explore the potential for combining an economic stimulus and
a speeded-up environmental cleanup to contribute to achieving environmental justice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cities, counties, towns, states, and Native American tribes are all eligible to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals will be evaluated on the following Criteria (a more detailed and complete set of criteria will be included
in the application booklet):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Demonstrated commitment of public and private leadership to brownfields redevelopment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Plans for effective community involvement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 6, 1992, EPA issued registrations for Accufilter Straw, EPA Registration Number 64906-1, and Accufilter
Sport Bottle, EPA Registration Number 64906-2. These silver-activated carbon filters are intended to remove the
taste of chlorine and other sources of bad taste, odor, and color from drinking water. These registrations were based,
in part, on receipt and review of water samples analyzed for silver content. EPA has subsequently determined that
the registrant did not report the actual silver content in those water samples, but instead submitted false information
showing the silver values to be lower than those actually obtained by the laboratory that conducted the sampling.
Registrations obtained through the submission of false data are invalid for any purpose. By this notice, EPA announces
and orders the revocation of registrations 64906-1 and 64906-2. As a result of these revocations, the sale, distribution,
or use of existing stocks of these water filters after November 21, 1994 would be unlawful.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 6, 1992, EPA issued registrations to Accuventure, Inc., Beaverton, OR, for the drinking water filters
Accufilter Straw, EPA Registration Number 64906-1, and Accufilter Sport Bottle, EPA Registration Number 64906-2.
The company name was subsequently changed to Accufilter International, Inc., at the Beaverton, OR, address.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These registrations were for drinking water filters in which silver was impregnated on activated carbon. The filters
are intended to remove sources of odors and taste from drinking water. Silver is an element, and a secondary standard
for silver in drinking water has been established. Under provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act, a secondary standard
for a drinking water contaminant is not enforceble; rather, it is established for aesthetic purposes. Exposure to
silver can cause argyria, a discoloration of skin or other tissues, which is usually permanent. Although not a toxic
response, it is an undesirable cosmetic change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The registration applications for these filters include analyses of water samples from tests utilizing these filters.
The testing was intended to reflect actual use conditions and included sufficient flushing of the filters to represent
use over varying portions of the filter's useful life (new filters, 10%, 60%, 95% of filter life). Twenty four (24)
sample analyses were reported from the laboratory. EPA has learned that in the testing performed by the laboratory
and reported to the registrant, 14 samples were at or exceeded 0.05 milligram/liter (mg/L) of silver in drinking water.
At the time of registration (1992) the secondary drinking water standard (maximum contaminant level) for silver
was 0.05 mg/L. (This standard has subsequently been increased to 0.1 mg/L). When this report was forwarded to EPA in
support of the registration applications, all 14 values had been reduced below the standard. The original data suggest
that some of the filters may leak silver, that higher levels of silver than reported occur in drinking water as a consequence
of use of the filters, and that quality control of the filters may be inadequate.

This Notice has two parts: Part I describes the basis for the revocation of registrations for Accufilter Straw and
Accufilter Sport Bottle; Part II describes the procedures which will be followed in implementing the regulatory
actions set forth in this notice, including the treatment of existing stocks.

I. Basis For Revocation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C. 135 et. seq., does not prescribe procedures
to be used to revoke a registration that has been obtained through a willful act of misrepresenting data submitted
in support of registration. In the absence of such procedures, the termination of a license such as a pesticide registration
is governed by section 558 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 558. Section 558 states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Except in cases of willfulness or those in which public health, interest, or safety requires otherwise, the withdrawal,
suspension, revocation, or annulment of a license is lawful only if, before the institution of agency proceedings
therefore, the licensee has been given_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) notice by the agency in writing of the facts or conduct which may warrant the action; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with all lawful requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 06 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Courts have interpreted willfulness to mean ``an intentional misdeed or such gross neglect of a known duty as to be
the equivalent thereof.''

In this case, the registrant submitted data which were changed from the original, and did not reflect true results
of the analyses of the samples. The altered results suggested lower silver content in the drinking water than actually
occurred as a consequence of use of the filters. This was an intentional act, not an accidental one; therefore, it falls
squarely within the definition of ``willful.'' Because the registrations were obtained through misrepresentation
and a willful violation of the provisions of FIFRA, the registrations were not valid when granted and section 558 does
not require that EPA provide notice to the registrant or an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance prior
to revocation of the registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not required in this case, the Agency did provide the registrant written notice as well as an opportunity
to respond to the allegations against him. The registrant has responded that he did not alter the data, but has not provided
evidence to support his contention. These procedures go beyond what is required by the APA in cases of willful violations
of law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended
by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675, notice is hereby
given that a proposed Prospective Purchaser Agreement (``Agreement'') associated with the Commodore Semiconductor
Group Superfund Site (the ``Site'') in Norristown, Lower Providence Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,
was executed by the Environmental Protection Agency (``Agency'') on Nov. 14, 1994 and is subject to final approval
or disapproval by the United States Attorney General or her designee. The Prospective Purchaser Agreement would
resolve certain potential EPA claims under Section 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607, against GMT Microelectronics,
Inc. (``Purchaser''). The Agreement provides that in exchange for a limited Covenant Not to Sue which relates only
to existing contamination at the Site, and contribution protection, the Purchaser will provide the Agency with a
``substantial benefit'' which consists of the following: (1) Payment of EPA's response costs at the Site incurred
prior to the effective date of the Agreement (approximately six-hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars ($625,000));
(2) Payment of approximately three-hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars ($375,000) into an Escrow fund established
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement signed by the Purchaser and EPA, to be used to pay response costs incurred by EPA or any
private party conducting response work at the Site pursuant to a Consent Decree or Unilateral Administrative Order
signed by EPA, after the effective date of this Agreement (``Lump Sum Future Response Cost Payment''); (3) Payments
of up to thirty-five thousand dollars annually for Remedial Action Oversight Costs, to be paid to the ``EPA Hazardous
Substance Response Superfund;'' (4) Payments of up to sixty-five thousand dollars ($65,000) annually for response
costs incurred at the Site. This money will be paid into the Escrow fund, and disbursed in a manner similar to the Lump
Sum Future Response Cost Payment. The Purchaser also agrees to provide EPA and its authorized representatives with
unrestricted access to the Site, and not to interfere with remedial activities at the Site.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with Section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9622(i), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), Region
II announces a proposed administrative 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 settlement pursuant to Section 122(g)(4) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(4), relating to the Niagara County Refuse
Superfund Site (``Site''). The Site is located in the Town of Wheatfield and City of North Tonawanda, Niagara County,
New York and is on the National Priorities List established under Section 105 of CERCLA. This notice is being published
pursuant to Section 122(i) of CERCLA to inform the public of the proposed settlement and of the opportunity to comment.
EPA will consider any comments received during the comment period and may withdraw or withhold consent to the proposed
settlement if comments disclose facts or considerations which indicate that the proposed settlement is inappropriate,
improper or inadequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
settlement will be memorialized in an Administrative Order on Consent (``Order'') between EPA and eleven settling
parties (``Respondents''). Under the Order, the Respondents will be obligated to pay an aggregate of $793,866 to
the Hazardous Substances Superfund. The amount required to be paid by each settling party represents the share attributable
to such Respondent of projected total response costs at the Site, based upon the Respondent's estimated volumetric
contribution, plus a premium to account for the potential of cost overruns, the potential of failure of the selected
remedy and other risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to CERCLA Section 122(g)(4), the Order may not be issued without the prior written approval of the Attorney
General or her designee. In accordance with that requirement, the Attorney General or her designee has approved the
proposed administrative order in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA intends to settle with other potentially responsible parties concerning the performance of the remedy selected
for the Site and concerning payment of additional amounts to EPA in respect of past costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements for the State Administrative Plan are established by section 613 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended. FEMA's implementing regulation is 44 CFR Part 302.3. The plan is
a formal description of each participating State's emergency preparedness program and related State and local laws,
executive directives, rules, plans, and procedures. It includes documentation on administrative and financial
systems to assure compliance with uniform administrative requirements for grants and cooperative agreements to
States and their subgrantees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan is a one-time submission with annual updates to keep it current. Plans and updates are submitted to the FEMA
Regional Offices along with the annual applications for funding under emergency management programs. FEMA uses
the information to determine whether a State legally qualifies for Emergency Management Assistance matching funds.

The company listed in this notice has filed an application under  225.23(a)(1) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.23(a)(1))
for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8)) and  225.21(a)

The application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application

Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.

The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), through its Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA),
announces that it is initiating a Health Technology Review of the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation
for hematopoietic reconstitution in patients given high-dose chemotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, AHCPR is requesting information on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Indications and/or contraindications for the use of bone marrow transplantation in this patient population,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Specific patient selection criteria for the use of bone marrow transplantation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Information regarding the cost of this technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health Technology Reviews are brief evaluations of health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies prepared by OHTA/AHCPR of the Public Health Service. Reviews may be conducted in lieu of a technology
assessment because: the medical or scientific questions are limited and do not warrant the resources required for
a full assessment; the available evidence is limited and the published medical or scientific literature is insufficient
in quality or quantity for an assessment; or the time frame available precludes utilization of the full, formal assessment
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AHCPR is interested in receiving information based on review and assessment of past, current, and planned research
related to this technology, as well as a bibliography of published, controlled clinical trials and other well-designed
clinical studies. Also requested is information related to the characteristics of the patient population most likely
to benefit from the use of bone marrow transplants in the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as information on the
clinical acceptability, effectiveness, and the extent of use of this technology. Information relevant to this review
should be submitted in writing no later than [insert date 90 days after the date of publication] to OHTA at the address
below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To enable the interested scientific community to evaluate the information included in this review, AHCPR will discuss
in the review only those data and analyses for which a source(s) can be cited. Respondents are therefore encouraged
to include with their submission a written consent permitting AHCPR to cite the source of the data and comments provided.
Otherwise, in accordance with the confidentiality statute governing information collected by AHCPR, 42 U.S.C.
299a&hyph;1(c), no information received will be published or disclosed which could identify an individual or entity
described in the information or could identify an entity or individual supplying the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written material should be submitted to: Thomas V. Holohan, M.D., Director, Office of Health Technology Assessment,
AHCPR, 6000 Executive Boulevard, Suite 309, Rockville, MD 20852, Phone: (301) 594&hyph;4023.

Purpose: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Cerebral Palsy is a non-progressive multihandicapping condition caused by organic brain damage before, during,
or soon after birth. Cerebral Palsy has a prevalence rate of about 3/1,000 births in the United States. Researchers
believe that the etiology of Cerebral Palsy is associated with numerous perinatal factors, such as maternal infections,
physical trauma, premature birth, very low birthweight, anoxia, hemorrhaging, malnutrition of the mother, poor
prenatal and postnatal care, and environmental hazards during pregnancy. Although Cerebral Palsy has no cure, CDC
is actively seeking preventive measures based on population prevalence and epidemiologic risk factors associated
with Cerebral Palsy.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the land exchange is to facilitate more efficient management of public land through consolidation
of ownership and to benefit the public interest by obtaining important resource values. The public land to be exchanged
is isolated and difficult to manage with limited resource values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The private land being offered has very important values for wildlife, and watershed, that merit acquisition for
public ownership. The exchange is consistent with BLM land use plans, and the public interest would be better served
by making this exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the land to be exchanged is approximately equal, and the difference is within the legal limits. Equalization
of values will be achieved through cash payment by the proponent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exchange will be subject to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All valid existing rights, including any right-of-way easement, permit or lease of record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A reservation to the United States of a right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United
States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a period of 45 days from publication of this notice, interested parties may submit comments as follows: David A.
Koehler, Bureau of Land Management, Shoshone District Office, P.O. Box 2&hyph;B, Shoshone ID 83352&hyph;1522.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Objections will be reviewed by the State Director who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence
of any objections, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of the Interior.

Indiana Michigan Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating Licenses Nos. DPR&hyph;58 and
DPR&hyph;74 which authorize operation of the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, at steady-state reactor
power levels not in excess of 3250 and 3411 megawatts thermal, respectively. The Donald C. Cook facilities are pressurized
water reactors located at the licensee's site in Berrien County, Michigan. These licenses provide, among other things,
that they are subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect.

By letter dated October 9, 1991, as supplemented October 23, 1991, September 3, 1993, and September 29, 1993, the licensee
requested approval for disposal of licensed material pursuant to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part
20, Section 302. (That section has since been renumbered 2002).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is requesting approval to leave approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated sludge in place
underneath the upper parking lot on the D.C. Cook site. In 1982, approximately 942 cubic meters of slightly contaminated
sludge were removed from the turbine room sump absorption pond and pumped to the upper parking lot located within the
exclusion area of the D.C. Cook plant. The contaminated sludge was spread over an area approximately 4.7 acres. The
sludge contained a total radionuclide inventory of 8.89 millicuries (mCi) of Cesium&hyph;137, Cesium&hyph;136,
Cesium&hyph;134, Cobalt&hyph;60, and Iodine&hyph;131.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, ``The Commission may, upon application by a licensee or upon its own initiative, grant
an exemption from the requirements of the regulations in this part if it determines the exemption is authorized by
law and would not result in undue hazard to life or property.'' The staff has determined that the requested approval
for disposal of licensed material pursuant to Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 20, Section 2002 necessitates
an exemption to 10 CFR 20.2001.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee in 1982 evaluated the following potential exposure pathways to members of the general public from the
radionuclides in the sludge: (1) External exposure caused by groundshine from the disposal site, (2) internal exposure
caused by inhalation of resuspended radionuclide, and (3) internal exposure from ingesting ground water. The staff
has reviewed the licensee's calculational methods and assumptions and finds that they are consistent with NUREG&hyph;1101,
``Onsite Disposal of Radioactive Waste,'' Volumes 1 and 2, November 1986 and February 1987, respectively. The staff
finds the assessment methodology acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The doses calculated by the licensee for the maximally exposed member of the public based on a total activity of 8.89
mCi disposed are listed below.

For perspective, the radiation from the naturally occurring radionuclides in soils and rocks plus cosmic radiation
gives a person in Michigan a whole-body dose rate of about 89 mrem per year outdoors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 5, 1991, the licensee re-sampled the onsite disposal area to assure that no significant impacts and adverse
effects had occurred. A counting procedure based on the appropriate environmental low-level doses was used by the
licensee; however, no activity was detected during the re-sampling. This is consistent with the original activity
of the material and the decay time. The reduced level of radioactivity would not be detectable against background
through the shielding provided by the parking lot surface. The 1991 re-sampling process used by the licensee confirms
that the radiological impact of the 1982 disposal was very small. Based on the staff's review of the licensee's discussion,
the staff finds that the potential radiation exposure due to leaving the contaminated sludge in place is significant.
Based on the staff review of the exposure potential of the original quantity of material, and the measured level of
decay, the continued presence of the material poses no more radiological impact than disposal methods authorized
by 10 CFR 20.2001. Therefore, the licensee's proposed action would not pose a radiological hazard to life or property
and the exemption to 10 CFR 20.2001 allowing onsite storage of the radioactive material pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2002
is acceptable.

The staff has reviewed the licensee's request and concluded that issuance of this exemption will not endanger life
or property and will have no significant effect on the safety of the public or the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 20.2301, that this exemption as described in Section
IV is authorized by law, will not endanger life or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the
Commission hereby grants an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR 20.2001.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting of this exemption will have no significant impact
on the environment (October 31, 1994, 59 FR 54477).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

On September 6, 1994, the NASD put into effect a rule prohibiting the execution of a short sale in NM securities at or
below the current inside bid when that inside bid is below the previous inside bid.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In part, the NASD's rule provides an exemption for qualified Amex options specialists and Registered Options Traders
(``Traders'') for which the Exchange has also established rules to provide for this exemption for those members.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Exchange now seeks to extend the exemption to certain short sales of a company that is involved in a publicly announced
merger or acquisition with the issuer of a stock underlying an option that is eligible for the exemption pursuant to
Amex Rule 957 and the NASD's short sale rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange's proposal recognizes that when an NM security becomes involved in a merger or acquisition, specialists
and traders may need to hedge positions in options on the NM security by buying or selling shares of stock of the other
company involved in the merger or acquisition, whether or not the other company's stock has listed overlying options.
Indeed, where there are no options on that stock, buying or selling the stock itself may at times be the only feasible
way for a specialist or trader to hedge a position in options on the NM security, given the risk arbitrage relationship
that is likely to exist between the two stocks. The proposed rule change will facilitate hedging by options specialists
and traders by allowing them to sell short shares of the ``other'' company involved in the merger for hedging purposes
and designate those short sales as exempt from the NASD's short sale rule. The Exchange believes that its proposed
rule change will enhance the ability of specialists and traders to perform their market-making functions, which
will contribute to the liquidity of the market for options, as well as the market for stocks of both companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act. Specifically, the
Exchange believes that its proposal is consistent with the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in that it is designed to
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to permit CBOE options market makers to designate as ``bid test exempt''
under CBOE Rule 15.10 certain short sales of the stock of a company that is involved in a merger or acquisition with the
issuer of a stock underlying an option that has been designated as a ``designated Nasdaq/NM security'' in accordance
with CBOE Rule 15.10(c)(2)(ii)(B). To qualify as bid test exempt under this proposal, a short sale must serve to hedge
a position in an option covering the designated Nasdaq/NM security, where the option position was or will be established
in the course of bona fide market making activity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal recognizes that when a designated Nasdaq/NM security becomes involved in a merger or acquisition,
CBOE market makers may need to hedge positions in options on the designated Nasdaq/NM security by buying or selling
shares of stock of the other company involved in the merger or acquisition, whether or not the other company's stock
has listed overlying options. Indeed, where there are no options on that stock, buying or selling the stock itself
may at times be the only feasible way for a market maker to hedge positions in options on the designated Nasdaq/NM security,
given the risk arbitrage relationship that is likely to exist between the two stocks. The proposed rule change will
facilitate hedging by options market makers in this circumstance, by allowing them to sell short shares of the other
company involved in the merger for hedging purposes, and to designate those short sales as bid test exempt. The CBOE
believes that its proposal will enhance the ability of CBOE market makers to perform their market making functions,
thereby contributing to the liquidity of the market for options, as well as the market for the stocks of both companies.
This proposed rule change, like the remainder of Rule 15.10, is intended to operate in coordination with an exemption
from the bid test provided for in the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. It is CBOE's understanding that the NASD intends to
publish an interpretation of its bid test rule that is consistent with the amendment to CBOE Rule 15.10 proposed herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CBOE believes that the proposed rule change will enhance the ability of market makers to perform their market making
activities, thereby contributing to the depth and liquidity of the options market, and thus will serve in furtherance
of the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors
and promote the public interest.

of a stock underlying an option that has been designated as a ``designated Nasdaq/NM security'' pursuant to PSE Rule
4.19(c)(2)(B)(ii). To qualify as bid test exempt under this proposal, the short sales of the company stock involved

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Clear Channel Communications,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Clear Channel Communications, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from listing and registration
on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on November 4,
1994 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its stock and believes that dual listing would
fragment the market for its common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before December 6, 1994, submit a letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. HSBC is a bank organized and existing under the laws of Hong Kong. HSBC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings
BV (``HHBV''), a holding company organized in the Netherlands. HHBV is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings
plc, a holding company incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales. HSBC is supervised and regulated
by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority under the Banking Ordinance. In the United States, HSBC, through its branches
and agency in New York, California, Illinois, Washington, Oregon, and Texas, is licensed and supervised by the respective
banking authorities in those states and supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System under the
International Banking Act of 1978, as amended. As of December 31, 1993, HSBC had total consolidated assets of $146.5
billion, and consolidated shareholders' equity of approximately $4.7 billion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. BBME, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HHBV, is a bank organized and existing under the laws of Great Britain. In March
1994, BBME's head office moved to Jersey, and BBME currently is supervised and regulated by the Financial Services
Department of the States of Jersey. BBME, through its branch network of 25 offices, provides a full range of banking
services for both corporate and individual customers in the Middle East, the Bahamas, India, Switzerland, and the
United Kingdom, and has significant involvement in trade finance. As of December 31, 1993, BBME had total assets of
approximately $4.9 billion, and total consolidated shareholders' equity of approximately $193 million. BBME intends
to establish custodial services in selected offices during 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. HKBA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC, is organized and existing under the laws of Australia. HKBA is regulated
and supervised by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which exercises supervisory authority over the ownership, investments,
activities, and capital levels of banks incorporated in Australia. HKBA, operating through six branches across
Australia, provides a full range of banking services, including trade finance, retail and corporate banking, and
securities services. Together with its subsidiary, HKBA Nominees Limited, HKBA also provides custodian services.
As of December 31, 1993, HKBA had total assets of approximately $2.8 billion, and shareholders equity of approximately
$154 million. Assets under custody as of May 30, 1994, were approximately $1.3 billion.

4. Applicant seeks an order under section 6(c) exempting HSBC, BBME, HKBA, and Investment Companies and their custodians
from section 17(f). The order would let HSBC, Investment Companies and their custodians maintain ``foreign securities,''
as defined in rule 17f&hyph;5, cash, and cash equivalents (collectively, ``Assets'') in the custody of BBME or HKBA.
If the relief is granted, HSBC intends to maintain such Assets with BBME in any of the locations in which BBME has a branch
and with HKBA in Australia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 17(f) requires every registered management investment company to place and maintain its securities and
similar investments in the custody of certain enumerated entities, including banks having at all times an aggregate
capital, surplus, and undivided profits of at least $500,000. As defined in section 2(a)(5), ``bank'' includes (a)
a banking institution organized under the laws of the United States, (b) a member bank of the Federal Reserve System,
and (c) any other banking institution or trust company doing business under the laws of any state or of the United States,
(i) a substantial portion of the business of which consists of receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers
similar to those permitted to national banks, (ii) which is supervised and examined by state or federal authorities
having supervision over banks, and (iii) which is not operated for the purpose of evading the Act. Therefore, the only
foreign entities that may serve as custodians for registered management investment companies are the overseas branches
of U.S. banks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Rule 17f&hyph;5 expands the group of entities that are permitted to serve as foreign custodians. The rule defines
the term ``eligible foreign custodian'' to include a banking institution or trust company incorporated or organized
under the laws of a country other than the United States that is regulated as such by that country's government or an
agency thereof, and that has shareholders' equity in excess of U.S. $200,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. HSBC satisfies the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 because it is organized under the laws of Hong Kong, regulated
there as a bank by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and has shareholders' equity well in excess of the Hong Kong dollar
equivalent of $200,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. BBME and HKBA each satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5 except the shareholders' equity requirement. Absent
exemptive relief, therefore, BBME and HKBA may not serve as a custodian for Investment Company Assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicant asserts that each of BBME and HKBA is or will be capable and well-qualified to provide custodial and sub-custodial
services for Investment Company Assets. HSBC represents that the proposed foreign custody arrangements will afford
the Assets of Investment Companies held by BBME or HKBA the same protection afforded by rule 17f&hyph;5 as if the assets
were held in the direct custody of HSBC. HSBC will co-sign the agreement described in condition 2 below and will assume
liability for BBME's and HKBA's performance. Thus, under the agreement, the delegation to BBME and HKBA of the duties
and obligations of HSBC will not result in any reduction in the level of protection afforded the Assets of the Investment
Companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Section 6(c) in relevant part permits the SEC to exempt any person or class of persons from any provision of the Act,
or from any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and
provisions of the Act. Applicant submits that its request satisfies this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The foreign custody arrangements proposed regarding BBME and HKBA satisfy the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5
in all respects other than with regard to BBME and KHBA's level of shareholders' equity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicant will deposit Assets with BBME and HKBA only in accordance with an agreement (the ``Agreement'') required
to remain in effect at all times during which any of BBME or HKBA fail to satisfy all the requirements of rule 17f&hyph;5.
Each Agreement will be a three-party agreement among HSBC and BBME or HKBA, as appropriate, and the Investment Company
or the custodian for an Investment Company pursuant to which HSBC will undertake to provide specified custodial or
sub-custodial services and will delegate to BBME or HKBA such of the duties and obligations of HSBC as will be necessary
to permit BBME or HKBA to hold in custody Assets of the Investment Company or custodian. The Agreement will further
provide that the delegation by HSBC to BBME or HKBA will not relieve HSBC of any responsibility to the Investment Company
or custodian for an Investment Company for any loss due to such delegation, and that HSBC will be liable for any loss
or claim arising out of or in connection with the performance by BBME or HKBA of their responsibilities under the Agreement
to the same extent as if HSBC had itself been required to provide custody services under the Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. HSBC currently satisfies and will continue to satisfy the minimum shareholders' equity requirement set forth
in rule 17f&hyph;5.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company, Common Stock, P5 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;3006</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule
12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from listing
and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the Security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its American Depositary Receipts (the ``ADRs'')
representing the American Depositary Shares (the ``ADSs'') each representing one share of Common Stock have been
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'') and Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''). The Company's
ADSs commenced trading on the NYSE and PSE at the opening of business on October 19, 1994 and concurrently therewith
the Common Stock was suspended from trading on the Amex and PSE.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its ADRs representing ADSs on the NYSE and
PSE and its common stock on the Amex on the PSE. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading
of its stock and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for the common stock and its ADRs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before December 6, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the West Virginia Department of Highways (WVDOH), will prepare an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) for a proposed highway improvement to US 219 expanding the existing two-lane roadway to a four-lane,
controlled access highway. Most of the 52-mile highway improvement will occur in West Virginia, with a 2-mile section
at the southern end extending into Virginia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The intent of the project is to improve access in the project area where US 219 serves as the primary north-south route
through major population concentrations, business centers, and recreation areas in the eastern portion of West
Virginia. Also, the roadway comprises the southernmost segment of the 540-mile long ``Seneca Trail International
Highway,'' as US 219 is presently known. This highway proceeds from the Canadian border at Buffalo to Virginia, linking
with interstate highways to all mid-Atlantic and southeastern states. Following implementation of the US/Canada
and North American Free Trade (NAFTA) Agreements, increasing trade and tourist traffic is expected, which could
promote economic expansion in adjacent depressed areas of Appalachia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Present roadway deficiencies in the proposed project area include sections with poor geometric design, lack of sight
distance, poor level of service, restrictive speed limits, and a lack of passing opportunities. These functional,
operational, and physical deficiencies compel this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project alternatives will involve the No-Action Alternative and a combination of Build Alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will assess the alternatives and their environmental effects through detailed studies of socioeconomic,
natural, visual, and cultural resources; air quality; noise impacts; secondary and cumulative effects; energy
utilization; hazardous wastes; utilities; and permitting. Joint development prospects, congestion management,
the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term
productivity, and any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed
action will be determined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Plan of Study describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be forwarded to appropriate Federal,
State, and local agencies. Agencies will be invited to attend a scoping meeting where aspects of the proposed action
will be discussed. When completed, the draft EIS will be provided for public and agency review and comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning the proposed
action should be directed to the FHWA or West Virginia Department of Transportation at the addresses provided.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ITS program involves a range of advanced technologies and system concepts that, when used in combination, can
improve mobility and transportation productivity, enhance safety, maximize the use of existing transportation
facilities, conserve energy resources, and reduce adverse environmental effects. These goals contribute significantly
to the DOT's broader goal of developing a national intermodal transportation system for moving people and goods in
a safe and energy-efficient manner. The ``Department of Transportation's Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems
(IVHS) Strategic Plan'' (DOT Publication No. FHWA&hyph;SA&hyph;93&hyph;009) describes DOT's goals, objectives,
and program delivery plans for research and development, operational testing, deployment, and long-term ITS development
under the Automated Highway System program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operational tests serve as the transition between research and development (R&amp;D) and full scale deployment
of IS technologies. An operational test integrates existing technology, R&amp;D products, institutional, and
perhaps regulatory arrangements to test one, and usually more, new technological, institutional, or financial
elements in a real world test. The tests permit an evaluation of how well newly developed ITS technologies work under
real operating conditions and assess the benefits and public support for the product or system. Operational tests
are conducted in a ``real world'' operational highway environment under actual transportation conditions. This
distinguishes operational tests from research projects or other kinds of testing, for example simulation testing,
test tracks, or tests on facilities that are temporarily closed to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ITS operational tests are conducted as cooperative ventures between the DOT and a variety of public and private partners,
including State and local governments, private companies, and universities. The ``Department of Transportation's
IVHS Strategic Plan'' summarizes the roles of each participant in the National ITS Program and operational tests.
The general Federal role is to act as a leader and a catalyst, and to ensure adequate emphasis on public benefits. The
DOT also guides the design and conduct of the project evaluation to ensure that the project is independently evaluated
on a national program scale. The participating DOT administrations, the FHWA, the NHTSA, the FTA, and the RSPA are
involved in ITS and their specific ITS program needs will tailor the particular arrangements of the operational tests.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOT is also developing a National ITS Program Plan which will build on and expand the ``Department of Transportation's
IVHS Strategic Plan,'' providing the detailed ``road map'' required to both plan and track progress toward deploying
systems and technologies that support user services of the ITS program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Program Plan is being developed based on the following set of ITS User Services:

Proposed Operational Tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information below further describes the operational tests needed in the identified focus areas. It is the DOT's
intention to fund offers in these areas. These are listed in order of the user service numbering sequence identified
in the program plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. International Border Electronic Clearance (Commercial Vehicle Electronic Clearance_User Service 4.1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An operational test is needed to evaluate strategies to facilitate the movement of commercial traffic at highway
crossings along the United States-Mexico border. This test would involve the development of electronic credentials
and records that could be used to automatically verify the identity of the shipper, and the nature of the cargo, check
carrier safety and credential records. The purpose of this test is to extend the electronic clearance concept for
State border crossings to the Mexican border and support the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). By working
with Mexico, a more efficient traffic flow could be provided at border crossings and the deployment of technologies
in this country could ultimately prevent overweight, unsafe, or improperly registered vehicles from entering the
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of this test, while based on advanced technologies, will be dependent on the resolution of a number
of legal, technical, and institutional issues. The test will also have to address specialized enforcement and cargo
issues associated with crossing national borders. Automating the international border crossing process will require
the involvement and cooperation of the immigration and customs organizations of the countries as well as shippers,
carriers, local officials from the border States and provinces, and other relevant parties. While the general framework
for this concept might be the same for crossings along the border, specific system designs will have to accommodate
the variations in border crossing, laws, and language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOT is committed to accelerating testing activities in the area of International Border Electronic Clearance
to provide early deployment successes in support of the NAFTA and other related ITS activities. Proposals submitted
should reflect this commitment with realistic, aggressive time schedules and completion dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Automated Collision Notification (Emergency Notification and Personal Security_User Service 5.1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An operational test is needed to evaluate the improvements in safety and efficiency of emergency services offered
by systems that provide automatic notification of automobile collisions. In automobile crashes involving life-threatening
injuries, time is the most critical factor in saving lives, therefore, rapid notification and response by Emergency
Medical Service (EMS) personnel is a necessity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary goal of automatic collision notification is to reduce these times for medical assistance in those incidents
involving serious injury, where the occupants of the vehicle are incapacitated and unable to notify authorities
on their own. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The operational test will include an in-vehicle collision notification system which would determine that a serious
collision has occurred, and then automatically transmit information about the occurrence of the collision to the
proper authorities. This system should have the capability to accurately sense vehicle location, to sense that the
vehicle has been in a collision, and ideally to provide additional information with regard to the severity of the collision
and/or likely injuries. A report by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (``Technology Alternatives
for an Automated Collision Notification System,'' January 1994, publication no. FS&hyph;94&hyph;008, available
from Mr. Ray Yuan at (301) 953&hyph;6356) provides background on alternative technologies for crash sensing, communicating
the crash occurrence, and fixing the position of a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NHTSA will contract with an independent party who is not a member of the partnership to conduct the independent
evaluation of this operational test. The offeror, however, should address those selection criteria (listed below)
involving scheduling, funding, and responsibilities of members of the partnership in the conduct of the evaluation.
The proposal should also discuss how the partners will address the protection of the rights and welfare of participants
as spelled out in NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1 are directed to
the NHTSA individual named above under the heading, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
3. Intelligent Cruise Control (Longitudinal Collision Avoidance_User Service 6.1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An operational test is needed to evaluate improvements in safety offered by Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC) systems.
The operational test should include appropriate number of vehicles with an in-vehicle ICC system which would control
vehicle speed and headway and should not require active communications from other vehicles or roadside equipment.
This system should, at a minimum, have the capability to sense distance and relative velocity of other vehicles, accurately
control vehicle speed and headway, and to disregard vehicles in adjacent lanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of ICC systems is a higher level of convenience than is normally offered with standard cruise control,
however these systems have the potential for decreasing the number and severity of rear end collisions. The evaluation
will address both aspects of ICC. The proposal should discuss how the partners will address the protection of the rights
and welfare of participants as spelled out in NHTSA Order 700&hyph;1. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of NHTSA Order
700&hyph;1 are directed to the NHTSA individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.

Proposed Nontechnical Activity Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The operational test program provides an ideal opportunity to assess major institutional and legal challenges inherent
in implementing ITS. The DOT is interested in working with several of the selected partnerships to evaluate new approaches
that: (1) Speed up the process for executing an ITS partnership agreement; (2) provide for innovative procurement
methods; or (3) provide for innovative financing strategies. Specifically, the DOT's support may include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Administrative assistance to facilitate initial cooperation and communication among the project participants
during the preagreement process. The intent is to involve all project participants, including contractors and subgrantees,
as well as contract, technical, and legal staff of the project partners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Funding assistance to State and local governments to conduct innovative procurements and expedite the procurement
process, particularly for complex, highly technical systems, in connection with the test. This assistance may include
development of an acquisition plan, preparing statements of work and other contract documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Funding assistance for the legal and consulting services and other costs necessary to implement new funding
approaches, such as user fees, franchise fees, or use of venture capital to leverage private investment in ITS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested offerors are requested to indicate their willingness to participate in any of these initiatives and provide
additional information to support the decision for selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Evaluation is an integral part of each operational test and critical to the success of the National ITS Program. The
DOT Operational Test Evaluation Guidelines, dated November, 1993, provides information on established guidelines
and methodology for the evaluation of operational tests. Persons wishing to obtain a copy of the DOT Operational Tests
Evaluation Guidelines are directed to the first FHWA individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
CONTACT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The evaluation guidelines, that shall apply to all operational tests funded in whole or part with Federal ITS funds,
are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Individual operational tests will be structured within and have objectives which are consistent with the DOT's
Program Plan for ITS. This will guide the development of the evaluation goals of each operational test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The DOT will perform the role of evaluation coordinator for all operational tests. As evaluation coordinator,
the DOT or its agent will work with the other partners in establishing individual test objectives, including the national,
as well as local, goals and objectives that must be addressed during the evaluation; in developing the overall evaluation
plan and the detailed experimental design; and in conducting the actual evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The DOT will conduct the evaluation or require that it be conducted by an independent party who is not a member of the
partnership responsible for the operational test. The DOT reserves the right to conduct any additional evaluation
deemed necessary to satisfy the national objectives of the ITS Program. Where the evaluation is conducted by a party
retained by the non-Federal partners, the DOT shall retain approval authority to ensure the evaluation is acceptable
and unbiased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The ITS Partnership Agreement or other documents used to establish the operational test and funding arrangements
between the DOT and the other partners will include language to require that an evaluation plan be prepared in the early
phases of the operational test. There will also be language in all the agreements that incorporates the provisions
of these guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The operational test funding plan shall separately account for the evaluation phase. Funds identified for the
test evaluation shall not be spent for other portions of the operational tests. The DOT shall negotiate with the other
partners during the initial operational test definition to ensure an adequate estimate of the funding necessary
to meet the national evaluation objectives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Funding to proceed with detailed systems design and implementation for the operational test shall not normally
be provided until an evaluation plan has been approved by the DOT. Subsequent approval stages will be specified in
the ITS Partnership Agreement to ensure adequate development of the test and its evaluation. Funding for each test
may be provided incrementally to allow for the adequate completion of each of the defined milestones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Nothing in these guidelines shall preclude the non-Federal partners from conducting additional evaluations
for their specific needs. The non-Federal partners are expected to be involved in specific phases of the evaluation.
At a minimum, the non-Federal partners are expected to be part of the process to develop the goals and objectives of
the test and the overall evaluation plan. These partners will also be involved in much of the technical, legal, and
institutional data collection, archiving, and reporting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
8. The DOT reserves the right to require that additional data be collected and made available to allow the DOT to make
comparative analyses with similar functions or features associated with other national operational tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all tests, an independent and comprehensive test evaluation must be undertaken. The offer should indicate how
the independent evaluation will be accomplished and include an estimate of the evaluation cost. Once the operational
test project is underway, the independent evaluator should be brought into the process just before or, at the latest,
during the development of the detailed evaluation work plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Partnership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
An ITS operational test will typically involve a carefully crafted partnership that is negotiated among Federal,
State, local, private, and other institutions. A partner is an entity that participates directly in the preparation
of the operational test offer and plays a substantial role in defining the scope of the operational test, technologies
included, and financial participation. Management of the operational tests, including funding, technical and
administrative responsibilities, is shared among the partners in the operational test. Although an independent
evaluator is not considered a formal member of the partnership, the offer can identify a proposed independent evaluator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential private sector partners in ITS operational tests are encouraged, when appropriate, to work with appropriate
State and local transportation agencies or other public sector organizations in the preparation of proposed cooperative
ventures. Partners are also strongly encouraged to seek participation from certified Minority Business Enterprise
firms, Women Business Enterprise firms, Disadvantaged Business Enterprise firms, Historically Black Colleges
and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other minority colleges. Offerors are also encouraged to
seek opportunities that provide for the use of existing defense and space technologies for ITS applications.

Funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In accordance with &sect;6058 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102&hyph;240,
105 Stat. 1914, 2194, the maximum share of an operational test funded from Federal funds, including ITS funds, cannot
exceed 80 percent. The remaining 20 percent must be from non-federally derived funding sources and must consist of
either cash, substantial equipment contributions which are wholly utilized as an integral part of the project, or
personnel services dedicated full-time to operational test purposes for a substantial period, as long as these staff
are not otherwise supported with Federal funds. The non-federally derived funding may come from State, local government,
or private sector partners. In an ITS partnership, as with other DOT cost-share contracts, it is inappropriate for
a fee or profit to be included in the proposed budget. This prohibition on the inclusion of a fee or profit applies to
all partners to the proposed operational test. This does not prohibit appropriate fee or profit payments to vendors
or others which may provide goods or services to the partnership. For example, equipment vendors, software providers,
and entities retained for comprehensive operational test evaluation purposes would not be subject to this prohibition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOT, the Comptroller General of the U.S., and, if appropriate, the States have the right to access all documents
pertaining to the use of Federal ITS funds and non-Federal contributions. Non-Federal partners must submit sufficient
documentation during final negotiations and on a regular basis during the life of the operational test to substantiate
these costs. This includes items such as direct labor, fringe benefits, material costs, consultant costs, subcontractor
costs, and travel costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to maximize available Federal ITS dollars and be consistent with agency policy, prospective partners are
encouraged to increase their cost share to 50 percent. Additional funds provided over the required 20 percent minimum
may come from a variety of funding sources and may include the value of federally-supported projects directly associated
with the ITS operational test.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Funding levels vary significantly between operational tests and are primarily based on size, complexity, and funding
commitment by each of the partners. Federal ITS funding for the operational tests selected from the open solicitation
in FY 1993 and FY 1994 ranged from $200,000 to $5.5 million, with most of the tests falling in the $1 to $2 million range.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Negotiation and Approval Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Final approval and announcement of the selected offers are expected to take several months from the date the offers
are received. For those offers selected, the lead DOT agency will begin negotiations with the project partners to
reach mutually agreeable terms for an ITS operational test, including financial and technical issues. The negotiations
will result in a funding agreement that documents project tasks, roles of partners, a budget, and a schedule for project
execution and evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The funding agreement between the DOT and the partnership is arranged through one non-federal partner, typically
a State agency, who then serves as the lead for all funding agreements among the partners. Other non-federal partners,
including local governments, universities, and the private sector, could also serve as lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only upon successful completion of these negotiations would a partnership be formed. The funding agreement considers
the partners of an operational test to be independent contracting parties, and not business partners for the purposes
of sharing profits and losses.

Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (``Champagne'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;009) has petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser MPVs are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle
which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV that was manufactured for importation
into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer, Toyota Motor Corporation, as conforming to
all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Toyota
Land Cruiser MPV, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same
manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV is identical to its
U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. 30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United Sates, certified under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as
the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;006) has petitioned NHTSA to
decide whether 1994 Porsche 911 Carrera 2-door passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1994 Porsche 911 Carrera 2-door passenger car that
was manufactured for importation into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1994 Porsche 911 Carrera 2-door passenger
car to its U.S. certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1994 Porsche 911
Carrera 2-door passenger car, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards
in the same manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1994 Porsche 911 Carrera 2-door passenger car is
identical to its U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a decision
that a 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV that was not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards is eligible for importation into the United States because (1) it is substantially similar
to a vehicle that was originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and that was certified
by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards, and (2) it is capable of being readily altered to conform
to the standards.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i)(I) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. 30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model
of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA decides, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this decision in the

Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (``Champagne'') (Registered Importer 90&hyph;009) has petitioned
NHTSA to decide whether 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser MPVs are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle
which Champagne believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV that was manufactured for importation
into, and sale in, the United States and certified by its manufacturer, Toyota Motor Corporation, as conforming to
all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner claims that is carefully compared the non-U.S. certified 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV to its U.S. certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Champagne submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1991 Toyota
Land Cruiser MPV, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same
manner as its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily altered to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1991 Toyota Land Cruiser MPV is identical to its
U.S. certified counterpart with respect to compliance with Standards Nos. 102

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the present time, there exists a certain level of confusion regarding the filing and processing of protests concerning
the calculation, collection and demand for payment resulting from audit findings of Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (COBRA) user fees, the Merchandise Processing Fee (MPF), and the Harbor Maintenance Fees (HMF).
Protests concerning these user fees are being received at various Customs locations throughout the United States,
and requests for guidance have been received from the public and Customs field managers as to where these protests
should be filed and how Customs will process them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Customs intends to amend Part 174 of Title 19, Code of Federal Regulations, to provide specific procedures for the
filing of user fee-related protests. In the meantime, this notice is published to provide flexibility in the filing
of protests, accommodate the public's desire for local accountability, and provide guidance as to Customs preference
regarding where protests should be filed. In addition, Customs seeks to comply with the Court of International Trade
decision rendered in

United States, et al.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 CIT Slip Op. 94&hyph;16 (Feb. 1, 1994), which held that user fee-related protests may be filed, in accordance with
&sect;24.73, Customs Regulations (19 CFR 24.73) at Customs headquarters. Accordingly, while Customs will continue
to accept user fee-related protests at headquarters, Customs feels it serves the convenience of the public as well
as that of the government to show a level of flexibility on this issue and also accept protests filed in locations more
convenient to the public. To this end, it is suggested that the guidelines below be followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Place of Filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Protests concerning the constitutionality of the Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF) on exports should be sent to the U.S.
Customs Service, National Finance Center, at the following address: Director, National Finance Center, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Customs Service, 6026 Lakeside Blvd., Indianapolis, IN 46278, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attn: Revenue Branch, HMF Protest Team. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Only protests which specifically concern the constitutionality of the HMF should be sent to this address. HMF protests
which do not concern the constitutionality of the fee, and protests relating to user fees other than the HMF, are not
covered by this procedure. See below for additional guidance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Form of Protests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HMF constitutionality protests may be filed on Customs Form 19, or in letter form, or in the form of statements of protest
affixed or appended to Customs Form 349, Quarterly Summary Report. Each protest should reference an Employer Identification
Number (EIN), Internal Revenue Service (IRS) number, Customs-assigned number, or Social Security Number (SSN).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Time of Filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Protests which concern the constitutionality of the HMF on exports should be filed in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1514
within 90 days after the date on which each quarterly payment is due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HMF payments are due within 31 days following the end of each calendar quarter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example: A protest filed for the calendar quarter ending March 31 would be due no later than July 30 (end of quarter:
March 31; HMF payment due within 31 days: no later than May 1; protest due within 90 days of payment date: no later than
July 30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Level of Specificity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
User fee-related protests should be of a level of specificity and detail equivalent to that required by &sect;174.13,
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 174.13). Details of the circumstances surrounding the calculation, collection, or
demands for payment, as well as amounts of fees due and dates paid, should be included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protests received by the Customs Service which do not conform to the required level of specificity will be considered
incomplete, and notices will be sent to protestants which describe the additional information required. Such protests
will be held until 30 days following the date of the notice that the protest is incomplete, or until expiration of the
90-day period within which such protests may be filed (90 days from the dates that the fee payments are due), whichever
is longer. During this time, protestants may submit the additional information. If the requested additional information
is not received prior to the expiration of this period, protests will be denied on the grounds that they are incomplete.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This report is to give notice of an altered Bureau of the Public Debt system of records entitled, ``Personnel and Administrative
Records_Treasury/BPD .001,'' which is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of the Public Debt is amending its present system of records covering personnel and administrative records
for the following reasons:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To cover categories of records added by new programs. An example is records covered by the Family Medical and Leave
Act of 1993. Where records are covered by another system of records, such as an Office of Personnel Management governmentwide
system, those records are not covered here. An example is Official Personnel Folders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To more fully describe locations at which records are maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To show additional categories of individuals covered by the system of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) To show new and amended routine uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) To show additional categories of sources of records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) To incorporate another system of records. The Savings Bonds Division has now been merged with the Bureau of the
Public Debt. The Savings Bonds Division is no longer a separate Treasury component. Therefore, system of records
Treasury/USSBD .001, Savings Bonds Employee Records System, is being incorporated into the Bureau of the Public
Debt system of records Treasury/BPD .001, Personnel and Administrative Records. In accordance with OMB Circular
A&hyph;130, Treasury/USSBD .001 will be deleted from the Treasury Department's inventory of systems of records.
The notice for Treasury/USSBD .001 was last published at 57 FR 14134 dated April 17, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) To reflect the consolidation of Bureau of the Public Debt personnel and administrative offices and the shifting
of most of these types of records to Parkersburg, West Virginia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system of records is limited to those records Public Debt needs to function in an efficient manner and does not
cover those records reported under another system of records notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The altered system of records report, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, has been submitted to the Committee
on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and
the Office of Management and Budget, pursuant to Appendix I to OMB Circular A&hyph;130, Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records About Individuals, dated July 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Privacy Act system of records notice Treasury/USSBD .001, Savings Bonds Employee Records System, is removed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed altered system of records Treasury/BPD .001, Personnel and Administrative Records, is published in

Memorandum and resolution re: Final amendments to Part 330 of the Corporation's rules and regulations, entitled
``Deposit Insurance Coverage,'' which (1) require that certain written disclosures be made by insured depository
institutions to employee benefit plan depositors in certain situations in order to reduce the uncertainty about
whether such accounts are eligible for ``pass-through'' deposit insurance coverage and to provide a timely disclosure
to such depositors when such coverage no longer is available; and (2) make two technical amendments to Part 330 involving
the insurance rules for joint accounts and the accounts for which an insured depository institution is acting as a
fiduciary.

Notice of Vote to Close Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its meeting on November 7, 1994, the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service voted unanimously to
close to public observation its meeting scheduled for December 5, 1994, in Tampa, Florida. The members will consider
1) an incentive compensation program; and 2) the Postal Rate Commission's Decision in Docket No. R94&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace, Setrakian and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary
to the Board Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552(c)(2) and (3) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(b)
and (c) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement
of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose 1) internal personnel practices;
and 2) information in connection with proceedings under Chapter 36 of Title 39, United States Code (having to do with
postal ratemaking, mail classification and changes in postal services), which is specifically exempted from disclosure
by section 410(c)(4) of Title 39, United States Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has determined further that pursuant to section 552b(c)(10 of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(j)
of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion of Docket No. R94&hyph;1 is exempt because it is likely to
specifically concern participation of the Postal Service in a civil action or proceeding involving a determination

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Research in Education of Individuals with Disabilities Program, authorized by Part E of the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1441&hyph;1443), provides support: (1) To advance and improve the knowledge
base and improve the practice of professionals, parents, and others providing early intervention, special education,
and related services_including professionals in regular education environments_to provide children with disabilities
effective instruction and enable them to successfully learn; and (2) for research and related purposes, surveys
or demonstrations relating to physical education or recreation, including therapeutic recreation, for infants,
toddlers, children, and youth with disabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 1, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities for this program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 39232&hyph;39234).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These final priorities support the National Education Goals by improving understanding of how to enable children
and youth with disabilities to reach higher levels of academic achievement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The publication of these priorities does not preclude the Secretary from proposing additional priorities, nor does
it limit the Secretary to funding only these priorities, subject to meeting applicable rulemaking requirements.
Funding of particular projects depends on the availability of funds, and the quality of the applications received.
Further, FY 1995 priorities could be affected by enactment of legislation reauthorizing these programs.

In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priorities, six parties submitted comments.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the development of new assessment instruments should be accompanied by checks for reliability
and validity.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the priority is to support research projects, not instrument development. The Secretary believes
that the priority as written allows applicants to address technical characteristics such as reliability and validity
among the possible research issues to be studied.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern that old definitions of technical adequacy might be inappropriate for alternative
forms of assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The priority as written does not specify what technical criteria should be applied to alternative assessments, but
raises this question as one possible research issue. The Secretary prefers that applicants be given flexibility
to propose the technical criteria to be applied to alternative assessments.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that Issue 4 ``Including students with disabilities in general assessments'' be expanded
to include other forms of diversity such as cultural and racial backgrounds.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As written, the priority's focus on students with disabilities is consistent with the authorizing statute. Applicants
may add other forms of diversity to this focus as appropriate for their particular research issues.

 The organizations specified by the commenter are all eligible applicants under this program. Collaboration may
or may not be appropriate for the type of research proposed. Applicants may develop collaborative arrangements as
appropriate for their proposed program of research.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the research issues listed in the priority be expanded to include issues focused specifically
on accountability and issues related to professional skill and knowledge. Another commenter suggested that the
list be expanded to include the issue of comparability of measures across different patterns of age, race, ethnicity,
language, and migration status.

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The priority as written supports research on issues related to ``outcome assessment and/or outcomes-based accountability
for students with disabilities'' that ``include, but are not limited to'' the issues listed in the priority. The list
is intended to be illustrative and not exhaustive, and to include a range of assessment and accountability issues
without being excessively complex and prescriptive. Applicants may certainly address important research issues
which are not included on this list.

The Secretary agrees that applicants should be allowed to add or create models. The models mentioned in the background
section were meant only to serve as examples of the range of models. Applicants may study other existing models, such
as teacher networking models, or use models they have created.

One commenter cited the priority as extremely important in making the final step between research findings and practice
if research is to have meaning for students and teachers. The commenter suggested that the model testing involve a
teacher training component in how to interpret and translate research findings into practice.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggested that the Department require applicants to develop approaches that use a broad body of content/strategies
that inform both special and regular education. The commenter also suggested that the applicant be required to present
the research supporting the effectiveness of the content to be implemented and the rationale for site selection.
It was further suggested that the term ``model'' was not appropriate because it suggested something standardized
rather than an approach that could be ``*&blank;*&blank;* adapted and implemented to fit particular situations.''

Discussion: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees that the approaches should be broad enough that they have potential implications for both special
and general education. In fact, some of the models used as examples in the priority as written are based in regular education.
The Secretary agrees that applicants should present the research literature supporting the effectiveness of the
chosen approach and justify study sites, and notes that the selection criteria included in the application package
address these issues. Further, judging the effectiveness of the implemented model is already a requirement of the
priority. The Secretary believes that any further requirements would make the priority unnecessarily prescriptive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the commenters concern on the use of the term ``model'', for the purpose of this priority, the term ``model''
is meant in its more generic sense of a design or approach, thus allowing the applicant flexibility in selecting and
implementing a knowledge utilization model.

The Secretary agrees that teachers are deserving of support, but notes that they are eligible to apply through their
local educational agencies for awards under the Research in Education of Individuals with Disabilities Program.
The Secretary believes that the priority as written is an important vehicle for attracting, promoting, and supporting

One commenter recommended that the competitive preference for students who are members of groups that have been underrepresented
in the field of special education research be limited to a maximum of 25% of the awards made within the competition.
The commenter recommended a cap so that all eligible students believe the probabilities for competing are sufficient

Absolute Priority 1_Examining Alternatives for Outcome Assessment for Children with Disabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many students with disabilities are currently excluded from national, State, and local outcome assessments and
outcomes-based accountability systems. This exclusion has the effect of weakening educational accountability,
limiting educational opportunities for students with disabilities, and denying these students the potential benefits
of educational reforms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This problem is addressed in new Federal legislation, ``The Goals 2000: Educate America Act.'' (Public Law 103&hyph;227,
March 31, 1994). Section 220 of this Act supports development and evaluation of State assessments aligned with State
educational standards, with a portion of the funds reserved for developing assessments for students with disabilities.
Section 1015 calls for ``a comprehensive study of the inclusion of children with disabilities in school reform activities
assisted under *&blank;*&blank;* [the Act].'' This study is to include ``*&blank;*&blank;* a review of the adequacy
of assessments and measures used to gauge progress towards meeting *&blank;*&blank;* [education goals and standards],
and an examination of other methods or accommodations necessary or desirable to collect data on the educational progress
of children with disabilities, and the costs of such methods and accommodations *&blank;*&blank;*''. To support
and complement such efforts, further research is needed on a variety of technical and implementation issues.

Absolute Priority 2_Studying Models That Bridge the Gap Between Research and Practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Educational research most often includes the following phases: (1) planning and preparation; (2) information gathering;
(3) analysis and interpretation; (4) reporting and dissemination; and (5) use of findings. In traditional research
models, the researcher is solely or primarily responsible for all phases but the last. Using research findings is
seen as a job for the practitioner. However, it has been observed that research knowledge rarely translates directly
into practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years, a variety of models have been developed to bridge the gap between research and practice by altering
the roles of researchers and practitioners in the school district for one or more phases of the research. In some models
(e.g., interactive research and development, teacher-researcher partnership research) researchers and practitioners
collaborate in all phases of the research process. Some of these models include parents on their school-based teams.
In other models, practitioners, working individually (e.g., teacher research linkers) or in groups (e.g., teacher
study groups), or in pairs (e.g., peer coaching) interpret extant research to understand how to integrate research
into practice. In some models, teachers conduct research (e.g., action research, collegial experimentation).
To date there have been few systematic examinations of the effectiveness of these models to improve practice in special
education.

Priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Assistant Secretary establishes an absolute priority for research projects to implement and examine a model(s)
for using research knowledge to improve education practice and outcomes for children with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In studying a model(s), projects must apply methodologies with the capacity to judge the effectiveness of the model(s)
as implemented in practice settings. The projects must identify the knowledge utilization model(s) to be studied,
specify the components of the knowledge utilization model(s) selected or created, the supports and policies necessary
to support the model(s), both alterable and unalterable factors affecting practice improvement, and the effect
of the model(s) to improve the school culture, teacher attitudes and practices, and student outcomes. In judging
effectiveness, the projects must address improvements for researchers, practitioners, and children and youth
with disabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projects must report their findings in a manner which can serve as a ``blueprint'' for practitioners and researchers
in other school districts to implement the model using research knowledge to improve practice in special education.
