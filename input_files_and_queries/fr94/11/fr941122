<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule amends Food Stamp Program regulations relative to food stamp redemption and changes the definition of ``insured
financial institution''. This change is necessary because of statutory revisions to the Federal bank insurance
system. Financial institutions formerly insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC)
are now insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). This rule also modifies the procedures for financial institutions which deposit food stamps
at Federal Reserve Banks in order to be consistent with changes in Federal Reserve requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter II to reflect the abolishment of the Food and Nutrition Service and the establishment
of the Food and Consumer Service in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have
preemptive effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions
or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless
so specified in the ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions
of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In
the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020 (e)(10) and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules
related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at
7 CFR 278.8.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR part 278 contain requirements that firms authorized by the Food and Consumer Service
to accept food stamps may redeem them only at financial institutions which are insured by the FDIC or the FSLIC; or at
financial institutions which are insured under the Federal Credit Union Act and which have retail food stores or wholesale
food concerns in their field of membership (7 CFR 278.5). On August 9, 1989, the FSLIC, along with its parent organization,
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, ceased to exist. These institutions have been consolidated into the SAIF pursuant
to sections 211(6) and 401 of the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) (Pub.
L. 101&hyph;73, 103 Stat. 183). The SAIF is administered by the FDIC. This rule amends the Food Stamp Program regulations
to delete FSLIC wherever that reference appears. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also amending the regulations to be consistent with the Federal Reserve requirements that financial
institutions submit only balanced deposits to the Federal Reserve and use Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR)
to encode on the Food Stamp Redemption Certificate the verified amount of coupons received from authorized firms.
The redemption certificate is the deposit document that authorized firms use to deposit coupons with financial institutions
for credit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Deposit Balancing Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to improve the accountability in the food coupon redemption process and reduce the likelihood of fraud,
the Department enlisted the cooperation of the Federal Reserve to modify its depositing requirements for food coupons
to facilitate reconciliation of coupons deposited with deposit documents and redemption certificates. Financial
institutions are now required by the Federal Reserve to submit balanced deposits, which means that the face value
of coupons deposited must match both the amount of coupons entered on the financial institution's deposit document
and the total amount of coupons entered by authorized firms on the redemption certificates accompanying the deposit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
MICR-Encoding Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requiring financial institutions, or retailers with MICR-encoding capability, to MICR-encode the verified coupon
amount on redemption certificates allows redemption data to be electronically captured at the Federal Reserve Banks
and transmitted directly to the Department's computer processing center. It also allows the Federal Reserve Banks
and the Department to achieve greater accuracy and accountability in the coupon deposit reconciliation system while
using standard banking technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule dealing with these requirements was published at 56 FR 13,601 on April 3, 1991 and provided the public
with a 60-day period to submit comments on the proposed provisions. The Department received no public comments on
the proposed rule and this rule is being finalized without change.

Pursuant to Pub. L. 103&hyph;354, The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization
Act of 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum 1010&hyph;1, Reorganization of the Department
of Agriculture, on October 20, 1994. SM 1010&hyph;1 orders the abolishment of the Food Nutrition Service (FNS), and
the establishment of the Food and Consumer Service, which assumes the functions previously performed by FNS. This
rule includes amendments to 7 CFR chapter II which are necessary to bring Agency regulations into alignment with the
Departmental reorganization.

The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, with appropriate changes, the provisions
of the interim final rule which authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the Texas Valley Citrus
Committee (TVCC) under Marketing Order No. 906 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables
the TVCC to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer this program. Funds to administer this
program are derived from assessments on handlers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 906 [7 CFR Part 906] regulating the handling of oranges
and grapefruit grown in the lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas. The agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions
now in effect, oranges and grapefruit grown in Texas are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment
rate specified herein will be applicable to all assessable citrus fruit handled during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year,
beginning August 1, 1994, through July 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations,
or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a
hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of
business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is
filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 135 handlers of oranges and grapefruit regulated under the marketing order each season and
approximately 2,500 orange and grapefruit producers in Texas. Small agricultural producers have been defined by
the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small
agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these
handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Texas orange and grapefruit marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate
for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable citrus fruit handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets
of expenses are prepared by the TVCC, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and
submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the TVCC are handlers and producers of Texas oranges and grapefruit.
They are familiar with the TVCC's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and
are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The TVCC's budget is formulated and discussed in a public
meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assessment rate recommended by the TVCC is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments
of oranges and grapefruit. Because that rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which
will provide sufficient income to pay the TVCC's expected expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TVCC met on May 10, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $1,141,944 and an assessment rate of $0.16
per 7/10 bushel carton for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount
was $984,319, which is $157,625 less than the recommended $1,141,944 for this season and the assessment rate was $0.15,
which is $0.01 less than that recommended for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment income for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year is expected to amount to $960,000 based upon estimated fresh domestic
shipments of 6 million cartons of oranges and grapefruit. This, in addition to a withdrawal of $181,944 from the TVCC's
reserve fund, should be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. In comparison, the assessment income for the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal year was estimated at $825,000 based upon anticipated fresh domestic shipments of 5.5 million cartons of oranges
and grapefruit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds in the reserve at the end of the fiscal year, estimated at $276,468, will be within the maximum permitted by the
order of one fiscal year's expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major expense categories for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year include $132,444 for shared administrative expenses
with the South Texas Onion and Melon Committees, $650,000 for advertising, compared to $723,425 for the 1993&hyph;94
fiscal year, and $174,000 for the Mexican Fruit Fly support program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The expenses and assessment rates were authorized by an interim final rule issued on July 28, 1994, and published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [59 FR 39415, August 3, 1994]. A 30-day comment period was provided for interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committed met again on June 30, 1994, and unanimously recommended to increase expenses from $1,141,944 to 1,153,944,
which is an increase of $12,000 from previously authorized amount. The increase is necessary for funding of one-third
of the cost of a Texas Citrus Tree Inventory Survey. No change was recommended to the assessment rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee met once again on October 11, 1994, unanimously recommended an additional increase in expenses of $7,300.
The Committee recommended this additional increase to fund a post harvest project. This will bring the total recommended
expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year to $1,161,244. Once again no change in the assessment rate was recommended.
The additional funding needed for these increases will be taken from the Committee's reserve fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on
all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs should be significantly
offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS
has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be
incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate
the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [5 U.S.C. 553] because the Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous
basis. The 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the programs began on August 1, 1994. The marketing orders require that the
rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges and grapefruit handled during the fiscal year.
In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule
on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule terminates
the remaining administrative provisions of the Memphis order.

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of
an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After
a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in
any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the
date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This order of termination is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of
the order regulating the handling of milk in the Memphis, Tennessee, marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25576), concerning a proposed termination of the remaining provisions of the order. Interested
persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. Several comments were received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other
available information, it is hereby found and determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1097.1 of the order does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Statement of Consideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule terminates the remaining administrative provisions of the Memphis, Tennessee, Federal milk order. A public
hearing that considered proposed amendments to all Federal milk orders was held in September, October, and November
1990, pursuant to notice thereof issued July 11, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Following the issuance of a recommended decision
and the opportunity for filing exceptions, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services
on February 5, 1993, issued a final decision on the issues considered at the hearing. In a referendum held following
the issuance of the final decision, the proposed amended Memphis order was not approved by at least two-thirds of the
order's producers who voted. The Act requires that an order, as amended, be approved by at least two-thirds of the producers
who voted in the referendum or by producers who, during the representative period, produced at least two-thirds of
the volume of milk marketed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the record of the public hearing, the comments received in response to the proposed termination of Order
97, and the results of the producer referendum, the Department issued a termination order, effective midnight July
31, 1993. The order terminated the monthly operating provisions of the Memphis, Tennessee, order, but left intact
certain administrative provisions that were embodied, by reference, in &sect;1097.1 of the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The market administrator, in his capacity as the order's liquidating agent, has completed the disbursement of all
of the money remaining in the administrative, producer-settlement, and marketing service funds established under
the order. Hence, the remaining provisions of the order should be terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the aforesaid provisions of &sect;1097.1 of the order are hereby terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary
and contrary to the public interest in that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The termination is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions
in the marketing area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) This termination does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective
date; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written
data, views or arguments concerning this termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization of the Immigration and Naturalization Service was approved by Attorney General Reno on January
14, 1994. A copy of the organization chart, which graphically illustrates the approved structure, is published with
this final regulation as Appendix A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization will: (a) Create a clearer sense of mission by knitting together the Service's major functions
and programs; (b) decentralize decision-making authority and delegate authority to persons geographically closer
to the locations where work is being performed; (c) empower field operational units to improve the delivery of services
to customers; (d) re-engineer major processes, such as those which develop and disseminate organizational policy
and guidelines, and which are outdated approaches to handing records and information; and (e) develop a capability
and commitment to plan for the future, set customer service standards, and establish quantitative performance measures
to enable the Service to evaluate its programs and service delivery. To accomplish these goals, the reorganization
creates several new components through the restructuring of some existing ones and the abolition of others. Some
components retain their identity, but with revised duties and reporting relationships, while other components
remain unchanged. This final regulation formalizes the new components, responsibilities, and reporting relationships.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization reaffirms the position of the Deputy Commissioner and specifically empowers the incumbent to
serve as Chief Operating Officer for the Service. The Deputy Commissioner supervises the four newly established
Executive Associate Commissioner (EAC) positions. The EACs are for Programs, Field Operations, Policy and Planning,
and Management. The EAC for Field Operations supervises the Regional Directors who, in turn, supervise the District
Directors and Chief Patrol Agents. The other three EACS are staff to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner. The
responsibility for reconciling field and Headquarters requirements lies with the Deputy Commissioner, freeing
the Commissioner to set policy and represent the Service externally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Executive Associate Commissioner for Field Operations responds to field office needs; implements policy; ensures
consistency and program effectiveness in the work of Service districts and sectors, including the Service's foreign
offices; and serves as a single point of contact and advocacy at the Headquarters level for field issues. The EAC for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reorganization abolishes the four Regional Commissioner positions and replaces them with three Regional Directors
for domestic activities. They are responsible for Eastern, Central, and Western Field Operations. These three domestic
regions replace the old four-region configuration and provide an intermediate management level between dispersed,
complex field activities and Headquarters. Each region includes a southern and a northern border. The regional alignment
reflects an even, three-way distribution of Service workload and resources. The Regional Directors will also act
as spokespersons in their respective geographic areas.

The reorganization creates an Office of International Affairs and places it under the Executive Associate Commissioner

asylum program. This action establishes the foreign districts as a mini-region, and allows them to function as an
extension of domestic operations, discharging refugee and parole responsibilities.

The Office of Plans and Analysis is renamed Policy and Planning and moved under the new EAC for Policy and Planning.
This organization serves as a clearinghouse for Service policy and is responsible for a wide spectrum of policy activities,
including policy formulation, codification, and dissemination within the agency. To this end, the Office of Policy
Directives and Instructions is absorbed by the new organization. Strategic planning, annual priorities development,

The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 605 (b)), has reviewed this regulation and, by approving it, certifies that the rule will not have a significant

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is considered by the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, to be a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review and has been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget. As noted in the supplementary section of the rule, the Service has realigned
functions and responsibilities to increase overall operational efficiency. The organizational realignments,
decentralization and redelegation of specific programmatic responsibility and accountability, as well as empowerment
of staff, are critical changes being implemented by the reorganization. These initiatives are deemed by the Service
to be significant actions which are in conformance with the Administration's priorities as outlined by the National
Performance Review.

This regulation will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the National

Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism
implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to clarify approval of a supplemental
new animal drug application (NADA) 140&hyph;989 filed by Western Chemical, Inc. This action is being taken to reflect
that only Western Chemical, Inc., has approval for the use of formalin to treat shrimp infected with external parasites.

 In the

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 8, 1993 (58 FR 59168), FDA published a document reflecting approval of a supplement to NADA 140&hyph;989
filed by Western Chemical, Inc. The supplement provides for use of formalin solution (aqueous solution of 37 percent
formaldehyde) in tanks, raceways, and ponds to control the external penaeid shrimp protozoa

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Zoothamnium
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. The regulations amended 21 CFR 529.1030 to reflect that approval. Although the preamble to the November 8, 1993,
final rule specifically limited approval of Formalin for this use, the regulations did not specifically limit approval
to Western Chemical, Inc. Because Western Chemical, Inc., is the only firm that has an approved supplemental NADA
for this use, this document corrects that amendment.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document amends the Department of Veterans Affairs regulations relating to Service-Disabled Veterans' Insurance
(S&hyph;DVI) prefixed ``RH'' (pertaining to life insurance acquired by veterans with service-connected disabilities)
and ``ARH'' (pertaining to gratuitous life insurance benefits provided to veterans with service-connected disabilities
who are not competent to apply for such insurance) to reflect that the statute regarding such insurance has been amended
by the Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991 to provide for a two-year eligibility period and to provide
that ARH gratuitous insurance benefits must be paid in one lump sum. These amendments are necessary to conform the
regulations to statutory provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 201(b) of the ``Veterans' Benefits Programs Improvement Act of 1991,'' Public Law 102&hyph;86, in part,
amended 38 U.S.C. 1922 to increase the S&hyph;DVI eligibility period from one year to two years for veterans found
to be eligible for S&hyph;DVI on or after September 1, 1991. Section 202 of Public Law 102&hyph;86 amended 38 U.S.C.
1922 to provide that S&hyph;DVI ``ARH'' benefits must be paid in one lump sum. VA, accordingly, hereby amends 38 CFR
8.0 and 8.116 to reflect these statutory changes. VA has determined that prior publication for notice and public comment
is unnecessary since the amendments merely reflect statutory changes and are not subject to rule-making requirements.

(iii) Written application for such insurance must be submitted within two years from the date service connection
for any disability as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs is established based on the promulgation of
a rating subsequent to discharge. If it is shown by satisfactory evidence that the applicant was mentally incompetent
during any part of the two-year period, application may be filed within two years after a guardian is appointed or within
two years after the removal of such mental incompetency, whichever is the earlier date. If service connection for
a disability is based on a rating promulgated prior to September 1, 1991, then the written application must be submitted
within one year of the date the rating establishing service connection for the disability was promulgated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101-549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act), authorizes
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11, 1993, the Agency
promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules. On November 18, 1993,
the Agency published a notice of proposed revisions of those rules implementing sections 404(b) and (c) (substitution
plans) and 408(c)(1)(B) (reduced utilization plans) of the Act. On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement
agreement addressing substitution and reduced utilization issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reviewing the record, EPA concludes that the January 11, 1993 rules can be read to give utilities an ability to
use substitution and reduced utilization plans to create excess, new allowances. These allowances will authorize
sulfur dioxide emissions in excess of total emissions without the plans and will result from emission reductions
made, or required by federal or State law adopted, before enactment of title IV. This creation of allowances is contrary
to the purposes of sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) and can compromise achievement of the emissions reductions
intended under title IV. Consequently, EPA is modifying sections of part 72 of the January 11, 1993 regulations. The
rule revisions will prevent the use of substitution and reduced utilization plans to create excess, new allowances
and are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement.

The provisions in sections 404(b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act concerning substitution and reduced utilization
plans have specific statutory purposes related to the achievement of the sulfur dioxide emissions reduction goals
of title IV. The Agency maintains that Congress did not intend that these provisions provide utilities an ability
to create excess, new allowances by bringing Phase II units into Phase I. Because the January 11, 1993 regulations
implementing these provisions can be read to allow the creation of excess, new allowances in Phase I, the Agency is
revising today the regulations to ensure that this does not occur.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposal (58 FR 60950&hyph;60951), Congress established substitution
plans as a compliance option to increase units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance
in Phase I while still achieving the emissions reductions intended by Congress under title IV. A substitution plan
allows the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations
to a designated non-Table A unit under the owner's or operator's control. Upon approval of the reassignment, the non-Table
A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur dioxide and is allocated allowances.
Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances, which may be used by the Table A unit
(or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404(b)(5) of the Act expressly states that, with a substitution plan, the intended emissions reductions
must still be achieved. That section requires that, in approving a substitution plan, the Administrator ensure that
the substitution results in total emissions reductions at least equal to the total reductions that otherwise ``would
have been achieved'' by these Table A and non-Table A units ``without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5).
EPA concludes that the substitution provision is intended to provide an alternative means of achieving Phase I reductions,
not a mechanism for avoiding such emission reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision for reduced utilization plans has a statutory purpose that is also aimed at ensuring realization of
emission reductions. As explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60951), Congress recognized that the potential
for circumvention of emission limitation requirements exists because in Phase I only a minority of all utility units
are subject to such requirements. A Phase I unit could simply reduce its utilization by shifting its generation, and
the emissions that would otherwise result, to a unit that was not required to use allowances to cover its emissions.
Allowances allocated to the Phase I unit would be freed up for use without achievement, at either unit, of the intended
emissions reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 408(c)(1)(B), Congress adopted a solution to this problem. Owners and operators of any Phase I unit that,
for compliance purposes, propose reducing utilization of the unit below 1985-87 utilization (i.e., its baseline)
in order to comply with title IV are required to submit a reduced utilization plan. In such a plan, the owners and operators
must designate the units that will provide generation to compensate for the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit
or must account for the reduced utilization through energy conservation or improved unit efficiency. 42 U.S.C. 7651(c)(1)(B).
Each compensating unit in an approved plan becomes subject to Phase I sulfur dioxide emissions limitations and is
allocated allowances equal to that unit's baseline times the lesser of the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate
for the unit. The compensating unit will therefore have to use allowances to account for its emissions, including
any increased emissions resulting from compensating generation that it provides for the Phase I unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator approves or disapproves each plan (and compensating units proposed therein) after determining
whether the plan meets the requirements of title IV, including achievement of the intended emissions reductions
under the Acid Rain Program. 42 U.S.C. 7651g(c)(2); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60951. Thus, like the provisions for substitution plans, the provisions for designating compensating units
in reduced utilization plans are intended to allow compliance flexibility but also to protect the emission reduction
goals of title IV by requiring that plans not result in more emissions than would occur without the plans. In fact, if
the reduced utilization plan provisions were interpreted to allow the creation of excess, new allowances, utilities
could simply use such plans to circumvent the limitation on the creation of allowances under substitution plans by
bringing the same Phase II units into Phase I as compensating units rather than substitution units.

flexibility and potential cost savings resulting from use of the allowance market.

II. Need to Modify the January 11, 1993 Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The January 11, 1993 Regulations can be Read to Give Utilities the Ability to Bring Phase II Units Into Phase I and
Create Excess, New Allowances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated regulations that implemented the major provisions of title IV, including the
substitution and reduced utilization provisions. As discussed in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60951&hyph;60953),
these provisions can be read to provide utilities two alternative methods of bringing into Phase I, with few limitations,
selected Phase II units and creating excess, new allowances. The Agency concludes that both provisions must be revised
in order to eliminate this problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;72.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the designated representative for a unit on Table A may include
in the Phase I permit application a substitution plan designating, as substitution units, one or more existing units
that are Phase II units and so not on Table A. 40 CFR 72.41(b) (1993). There is no express requirement that the substitution
unit make reductions beyond those that it would have made without the plan or actually provide allowances for the Table
A unit and no express limit on the number of substitution units that a Table A unit may designate. Further, for the most
part, the decision whether to designate a particular Phase II unit as a substitution unit is at the discretion of the
utility. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 60952. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 72.43 of the January 11, 1993 regulations requires, under certain circumstances, that the designated representative
for a Phase I unit submit a reduced utilization plan designating a compensating unit. Such a plan must be submitted
if the owners and operators of the unit plan to reduce utilization of the unit below its baseline for purposes of complying
with Phase I emissions limitations and to accomplish this by shifting generation to a non-Phase I unit. 40 CFR 72.43(b)
(1993). Because of concern that utilities would be unable to designate compensating units and therefore might engage
in uneconomic dispatching to avoid reduced utilization requiring such designations, the regulation establishes
broad exceptions to the requirement to submit a plan. 40 CFR 72.43(e) (1993); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60958&hyph;60959. There is no express requirement that the Phase I unit actually have any reduced utilization
or the compensating unit actually provide any compensating generation to the Phase I unit. There is also no express
limit on the number of compensating units that a Phase I unit may designate and no express bar on a compensating unit
itself designating a compensating unit. Further, as with substitution units, a utility's decision to designate
a compensating unit is largely discretionary. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60952. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because utilities generally have broad discretion and flexibility in designating substitution and compensating
units, such units will likely be designated only if early entry into Phase I is beneficial, e.g., where early entry
creates new allowances because the units have lower actual emissions in Phase I than the allowances they will receive
as substitution or compensating units. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60953 and n. 2. Before the enactment of title IV, some Phase II units had reduced emissions rates for economic or
other reasons and some States had already adopted laws requiring their utilities to reduce emissions rates prior
to Phase II. Such reductions occurred, or will occur, for reasons independent of the substitution and reduced utilization
provisions. Under the January 11, 1993 regulations, for each Phase I year that a substitution or reduced utilization
plan is in effect, each substitution or compensating unit under the plan is allocated a number of allowances equal
to the unit's baseline times the lesser of the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate for the unit. 40 CFR 72.41(c)(3)
and (d) and 72.43(c)(4)(ii) and (d) (1993). Consequently, some Phase II units may enter Phase I as substitution or
compensating units and convert emission rate reductions into excess, new allowances: i.e., allowances that would
not otherwise be available and that reflect emission rate reductions that would occur even without plans allowing
early entry into Phase I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The excess, new allowances may become available to affected units in Phase I and/or in Phase II and enable such units
to avoid making emissions reductions that title IV would otherwise require them to make. These allowances may thereby
diminish the emissions reductions that Congress intended to be achieved by virtue of title IV. In sum, as explained
in the November 18, 1993 preamble, the January 11, 1993 regulations transform the statutory substitution and reduced
utilization provisions from provisions for facilitating and protecting anticipated emissions reductions under
title IV into potential means of creating excess, new allowances that can be used to avoid such reductions. (58 FR 60953.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the regulations provide alternative means (through substitution plans or reduced utilization plans) of
creating excess, new allowances, the regulations are contrary to Congressional intent and sections 404(b) and (c)
and 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act and therefore must be modified to eliminate both alternatives.

B. Under the January 11, 1993 Regulations, Entry of Phase II Units Into Phase I can Significantly Compromise the Emissions
Reduction Goals of Title IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential number of excess, new allowances created by substitution and compensating units under the January
11, 1993 regulations may be sufficient to compromise significantly the achievement of the emissions reductions
intended by Congress under title IV. The Agency estimates that entry into Phase I of Phase II units that will benefit
from becoming substitution or compensating units and that reduced emissions rates between 1985 and 1991 for economic
or other reasons or were required by federal or State law as of November 15, 1990 to reduce emissions rates between 1985
and 1995 will create about 200,000 allowances per year in Phase I in excess of emissions without such entry.

Thus, the current substitution and reduced utilization provisions will potentially result in the creation of excess,
new allowances authorizing additional emissions of 1,000,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in all of Phase I.

This is a conservative estimate of the potential for creation of excess, new allowances. Assuming that all 250 designated
substitution and compensating units in existing permit applications are activated as substitution units for all
of Phase I, about 385,000 excess, new allowances will be created per year under the January 11, 1993 regulations. Assuming
all existing Phase II units (about 2,000 units) will become substitution units for all of Phase I, almost 1,000,000
excess, new allowances will be created per year in Phase I under the January 11, 1993 regulations.

regulations.

 EPA estimates that the expected reductions by Phase I units alone during Phase I are about 2.4 million tons in 1995 and
1996 and about 3.5 million tons in 1997, 1998, and 1999. Memorandum from T. Larry Montgomery to Brian J. McLean (Oct.
15, 1993). As discussed above, the statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that Congress did not
intend these reductions to be eroded by substitution or reduced utilization plans. Yet, under the current regulations,
Phase I units can avoid some of these reductions by offsetting their emissions in Phase I with excess, new allowances
resulting from such plans. The use of 200,000 excess, new allowances per year in Phase I will negate a significant portion
(i.e., 6 to 8 percent) of estimated, expected reductions for Phase I units.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
uncertainty over what emissions decreases or increases would occur at Phase II units that would not be subject to emissions
limitations until Phase II. Because of the lack of emissions limitations on such units in Phase I, the Phase I emissions
of these units and the impact on total Phase I reductions could only be projected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatively, banking these new allowances for use in Phase II will diminish the intended emissions reduction impact
of the 8.95 million ton cap established by Congress for Phase II.

 See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 60954&hyph;60955 (explaining the importance of the Phase II cap). The carryover and use of the excess, new allowances
created by early entry of Phase II units into Phase I can result in emissions exceeding the cap for each of the first five
years of Phase II by as much as 200,000 tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The magnitude of potential erosion of expected emissions reductions supports the Agency's conclusion, based on
statutory language and legislative history, that Congress did not intend to allow substitution or compensating
units to create allowances for pre-Phase II emissions reductions that would have been achieved in the absence of substitution
and reduced utilization plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency's conclusion is also supported by Congress' approach in sections 404(e), 405, and 410 of the Act. As discussed
in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60954), the fact that in those sections Congress carefully limited the ability
of Phase II units to obtain additional allowances for pre-Phase II reductions strongly suggests that sections 404(b)
and (c) and 408(c)(1(B) should not be interpreted to allow allowance allocations for all such reductions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, contrary to the assertion of some commenters, the Agency's modification of the current regulations is not based
on circular reasoning. The statutory language and legislative history demonstrate that Congress did not intend
for substitution or reduced utilization plans to result in fewer reductions than without the plans. The analysis
that such plans under the January 11, 1993 regulations can result in about 200,000 excess, new allowances per year
in Phase I shows the potential magnitude of the problem and supports today's modification of the regulations to ensure
consistency with the statute.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate for Phase I as of November 15, 1990, the date of enactment of title IV of the Act. In addition, the final
regulations eliminate the language in the January 11, 1993 regulations providing that a Phase II unit that lacks any
common owner or operator but has a common designated representative with a Phase I unit can, without anything more,
be designated as a substitution unit.

1. Limiting the Allowances Allocated to Each Substitution Unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule limits the number of allowances allocated to each substitution unit by calculating the allocation
using the lesser of the unit's 1985 SO

 emissions rate that is reasonably representative of what would have been achieved without the substitution plan.
Specifically, a substitution unit will be allocated allowances equal to baseline times the lesser of: the unit's
1985 actual SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate as of November 15, 1990 applicable to the unit in 1995&hyph;99. The January 11, 1993 regulations consider
only the unit's 1985 actual or allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, section 404(b)(5) requires that the substitution plan include a demonstration that the ``reassigned
tonnage limits [under the plan] will, in total, achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than would have been
achieved by the original affected unit and the substitute unit or units without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5).
The Agency interprets this provision to require that the plan achieve total reductions equal to or greater than both
(i) the Table A unit's reduction obligation in Phase I and (ii) the reductions that the substitution unit would have
made if it had not entered Phase I, including reductions made, or mandated by federal or State law adopted, prior to
the passage of title IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations sets forth a different interpretation of section 404(b)(5) that
the Agency concludes is erroneous. As EPA explained in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60954&hyph;60955):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the January 11, 1993 preamble, the Agency stated that any reductions in emissions rate that have been, or will be,
made at the substitution unit after 1985 without the substitution plan (e.g., reductions for economic reasons or
required by federal or State law) ``will not have resulted from title IV'' and so should ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
be counted as reductions that would have occurred without the plan.'' 58 FR 3601 (emphasis added). The difficulty
with this interpretation is that it appears to read out of section 404(b)(5) the requirement to ensure that a substitution
plan does not negate reductions ``that would have been achieved by *&blank;*&blank;* the substitute unit *&blank;*&blank;*
without such substitution.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b)(5). In the absence of the plan, the substitution unit would not be
subject to title IV until Phase II. If only reductions required by title IV were considered under section 404(b)(5),
the amount of reductions that would have been achieved by the substitution unit without the plan (i.e., the reductions
in Phase I) would always be zero *&blank;*&blank;*. The reference to such reductions would therefore be meaningless.
In interpreting the Act, it should not be presumed that Congress adopted meaningless language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters on the November 18, 1993 proposal suggested a third interpretation of section 404(b)(5). They claimed
that the provision addresses only situations where, as part of the substitution plan, allowances that would be allocated
to the substitution unit are instead allocated by EPA to the Table A unit. Specifically, the commenters alleged that
the terms ``reassigned tonnage limits'' and ``such substitution'' in section 404(b)(5) are synonymous and refer
only to the ``allocation of a number of allowances to the Table A unit in addition to those that the Table A unit would
otherwise receive.'' Comments of UARG at 33 n. 54 and 34. Accordingly, it is argued that section 404(b)(5) requires
only that the number of additional allowances that are allocated under the plan to the Table A unit cannot be greater
than the number of allowances that are subtracted from the allocation that the substitution unit would otherwise
receive under the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency rejects this interpretation, which is inconsistent with the substitution plans that the commenters themselves
have submitted to the Agency and which would reduce section 404(b)(5) to a triviality. As the commenters noted, section
404(b) describes a substitution plan as ``a proposal to reassign, in whole or in part, the affected [Table A] unit's
sulfur dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit(s)'' under the control of the owner or operator of the Table
A unit. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b) and Comments of UARG at 33. According to the commenters, such reassignment occurs only where
allowances otherwise allocated to a substitution unit are instead allocated to the Table A unit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at 34 and 40&hyph;1. This is allegedly the only circumstance to which section 404(b)(5) would apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the commenters' interpretation were correct, then only those plans that actually provide for such an additional
allocation of allowances to the Table A unit would be substitution plans, as defined by section 404(b). However, although
&sect;72.41(c)(4)(ii) of the January 11, 1993 regulations provides the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
option
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to redistribute allowance allocations in this way, such redistribution is not required by &sect;72.41. Moreover,
EPA has not received a single substitution plan for any units that includes such a redistribution of allowance allocations.

of allowances from a substitution unit to a Table A unit). Under the commenters' approach, none of the substitution
plans submitted to date are ``proposals to reassign *&blank;*&blank;* reduction requirements'' under section
404(b). Further, the commenters' interpretation of section 404(b)(5) would reduce that provision to a trivial requirement
that EPA cannot give more additional allowances to the Table A unit than it takes from the substitution unit.

When section 404(b)(5) is properly interpreted, these problems evaporate. The term ``reassigned tonnage limits''
refers to the total allowance allocations made, in every substitution plan, to the Table A and substitution units
under the plan and not simply to redistributed allowances. Thus, section 404(b)(5) requires that each substitution
plan must result in ``the same or greater'' reductions of sulfur dioxide emissions as would have been made by the Table
A and substitution units without a substitution plan.

emissions reductions that would be achieved by the Table A unit, and not those by the substitution unit, in the absence
of the plan. Such reliance is misplaced because section 404(b)(5) explicitly requires that the emissions reductions

The Agency concludes that section 404(b)(5) must be interpreted to take into account, and avoid allocating allowances
to the substitution unit for, reductions that would otherwise have been made at the substitution unit since 1985 in
the absence of a substitution plan. The Agency maintains that there are two categories of reductions that would otherwise
have been made and that therefore should be excluded from the allocation of allowances to substitution units: (1)
emissions rate reductions that were made voluntarily, for economic or other reasons, by a substitution unit after
1985 and before enactment of title IV; and (2) emissions rate reductions by a substitution unit between 1985 and 2000
that were mandated by federal or State law as of the enactment of title IV.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to the first category of emissions reductions, EPA is modifying the January 11, 1993 regulations to provide
that substitution units will not be allocated allowances for voluntary emissions rate reductions made before enactment
of title IV: i.e., reductions before title IV's enactment that were not mandated by federal or State law and that were
made for economic or other reasons. To the extent a unit's emissions rate reductions are caused by economic or other
factors that would have existed in Phase I even if the unit did not become a substitution unit, such reductions would
have occurred without a substitution plan and therefore must be taken into account under section 404(b)(5) and excluded
from allowance allocations. In theory, any reductions made by a unit between 1985 and 1999 could potentially be in
response to such factors and, if so, could be considered as reductions that would have occurred without the substitution
plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency maintains that there must be a bright line drawn to determine whether a unit's voluntary reductions in emissions
rate would occur even if the unit were not a substitution unit. It would be difficult to make accurate case-by-case
determinations, concerning a large number of units, as to whether the owners and operator of a particular unit took
actions after 1985 to reduce its emissions rate in anticipation of the unit becoming a substitution unit. Such determinations
would require analyzing economic and other factors that may be involved (e.g., fuel costs, the timing for retrofitting
of pollution controls, and the regulatory benefits and risks of becoming a substitution unit), balancing the factors
favoring or disfavoring action to reduce the emissions rate, and judging what the owners and operator would have done
in the past concerning the unit's emissions in the absence of substitution plans.

might have to be adjusted, each time the owners and operators of the unit take actions after approval of the substitution
plan that reduce the unit's emissions rate in Phase I.

The Agency concludes that the best approach to developing a reasonable approximation of what a unit's emissions rate
would be in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan is to treat all voluntary emissions rate reductions after 1985
and through 1990 (the year in which title IV of the Act was passed) as reductions that would have occurred in Phase I in
the absence of a substitution plan. Prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, utilities had no reasonable
expectation that emissions reductions would generate nationally tradable allowances under the Act. The reductions
were not made in response to the availability of allowances under substitution plans. December 31, 1990 (rather than
November 15, 1990, the specific date of title IV's enactment) is used as the cut-off point for determining what reductions
that would have occurred without the plan because emissions rate data is available on a calendar year basis. Even though
some reductions after 1990 perhaps would have occurred without the plan, it would be difficult to sort out, for a large
number of units, the impact of the availability of substitution plans for the period after the substitution provision
was enacted.

 emissions rate will be treated as representative of reductions that would continue to be made up through 1999. In the
November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency proposed to use the 1990 actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate as the measure of emissions reductions made before passage of title IV. The 1990 rate was proposed because,
as the emissions rate closest to November 15, 1990, it is more likely to reflect all the reductions made prior to passage
of title IV. The rate for an earlier year is less likely to reflect all reductions made before passage of title IV. However,
several commenters expressed concern that a unit's emissions rate for a single year (i.e., 1990) might be unusually
low and therefore unrepresentative of its emissions rate prior to the passage of title IV. These commenters suggested
that, if post-1985 emissions rates are used, the Agency should use a formula that allows consideration of actual emissions
rates for 1988, 1989, and 1990.

 Comments of Utility Air Regulatory Group at 45 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994); Comments of Northern States Power Company

rate because of normal variability in the sulfur content of coal or in scrubber performance. They suggested a case-by-case
determination of whether such variability accounts for the lower 1990 emissions rate.

 emissions rate to reflect pre-title IV emissions rate reductions. A unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate (which are
the most recent, actual rates prior to the enactment of title IV) will be treated as representative of its emissions
rate in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan. This provides some flexibility to avoid using a single and perhaps
unrepresentative year. All voluntary emissions rate reductions made after 1990 will be treated as reductions that
would not otherwise have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters opposed the use of any post-1985 actual emissions rate in limiting allowance allocations to substitution
units. Commenters argued the use of the 1990 actual emissions rate is arbitrary. Allegedly, this approach is arbitrary
because it assumes that emissions-reducing actions that were taken before 1991 for economic reasons will not necessarily
continue to be taken after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which changed the economics of such actions.
Commenters stated that utilities might redirect low sulfur coal from the potential substitution unit to another
unit and burn higher sulfur coal at the former unit. They also suggested that when the lower sulfur coal contract expires,
the utility might contract for higher sulfur coal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several problems with these commenters' arguments. A reduction in a unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate from
1985 could be the result of several types of actions, including the addition of pollution control equipment or the
use of low sulfur coal. To the extent that the reduction reflects a capital investment in pollution control equipment,
it is reasonable to assume that the equipment will probably remain in place and continue to be used. Even where the reductions
were achieved through the use of low sulfur coal, the use of such coal or switching to high sulfur coal requires, in many
cases, capital investment in new equipment. This reduces the likelihood that emissions reductions made before enactment
of title IV would be reversed after passage of title IV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, in section 404(b)(5), Congress required EPA to ensure that the reductions achieved under each substitution
plan be ``the same or greater than'' the reductions that would otherwise be achieved without the substitution plan.
42 U.S.C. 7651c. Because of the paramount importance apparently placed on the goal of achieving intended emissions
reductions, Congress required the Agency to adopt an approach that would ensure no fewer reductions with substitution
plans than without such plans but that could result in more reductions with than without the plans. In light of this
statutory requirement and the difficulty of determining what reductions would have been made without substitution
plans, the Agency concludes that the 1989 or 1990 actual emissions rate is a reasonable proxy for a unit's Phase I emissions
rate without the substitution plan. To the extent that the Agency's approach of using 1989 or 1990 emissions rate overstates
the reductions that would be achieved without the plan, the approach errs in a direction that ensures achievement
of the paramount statutory objective and is consistent with section 404(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, commenters' preferred alternative_using only 1985 actual or allowable emissions rates_would guarantee,
in some cases, violation of the statutory objective of no fewer reductions with, than without, the plan. One particularly
graphic example of that result is where a Phase II unit is voluntarily and permanently shutdown between 1985 and 1991
and is brought into Phase I as a substitution unit. Without a substitution plan, the unit would emit no sulfur dioxide
and receive no allowances in Phase I. With the plan, the unit would still have no emissions but would be allocated a significant
number of new allowances reflecting its 1985 emissions and other units could use the newly created allowances to authorize
emissions that would not otherwise have been allowed.

58 FR 38375 (noticing permit application with plan designating, as substitution units, Poston units 1, 2, and 3, which
were permanently shut down in 1987). The Agency's use of the most recent actual emissions rates prior to passage of
title IV is a reasonable approach to achieving the purposes of section 404(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also argued that the Agency's approach penalizes those utilities that were ``environmentally *&blank;*&blank;*
progressive'' and will discourage voluntary emissions reductions in the future. Comments of the Class of '85 Regulatory
Response Group at 8 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994). However, each utility that made emissions reductions at Phase II units
after 1985 and before the date (January 1, 2000) such reductions are required under title IV already benefits in Phase
II of the Acid Rain Program, during which the units are allocated allowances reflecting in part the 1985 emissions
rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments of Northern States Power Company at 3 (noting that allocations to most of the utility's units in Phase I and
Phase II exceed 1990 emissions levels). The issue here is whether, if such a utility elects to bring selected Phase
II units into Phase I, the utility should receive additional benefit (in the form of extra allowances for pre-title
IV reductions) that violates section 404(b)(5) of the Act. The Agency believes that the approach in the final rule
is a reasonable implementation of section 404(b)(5).

 emissions limitation imposed in Phase I by federal or State law, as of November 15, 1990. By definition, emissions
rate reductions that were mandated prior to title IV's enactment and that are required regardless of whether the unit
is a substitution unit are reductions that would have occurred in the absence of the plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes the difficulty of determining whether any particular federal or State emissions reduction
requirement (whether a tightening or a loosening of emissions limitations), adopted after title IV's enactment,
would have been adopted in the absence of substitution plans under title IV.

 This is similar to the problem of determining whether voluntary emissions rate reductions after 1990 would have been
made without a substitution plan, except that, with regard to federal or State emissions limitations, political
factors favoring or disfavoring imposition of the limitations would have to be weighed. Consequently, the Agency
maintains that a bright line, based on title IV's date of enactment, should be established and that emissions rate
reductions that were mandated by federal or State law adopted after November 15, 1990 should not be treated as reductions
that would otherwise have occurred. As explained in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposal (58 FR 60956), the
most stringent allowable rate for purposes of substitution-unit allowance allocations will be the most stringent
rate as of November 15, 1990 after conversion to pounds per mmBtu but without any annualization.

In contrast, State emissions limitations adopted prior to passage of title IV do not raise the same question about
whether they would have been adopted in the absence of title IV. Such emissions limitations, e.g., the Massachusetts
acid rain law passed in 1985, were in fact adopted in the absence of any federal acid rain program. The Massachusetts
statute included a provision stating that the Massachusetts legislature intended that reductions made under that
statute be credited to Massachusetts' share of required reductions if a federal acid rain program was established
in the future. Massachusetts, Acts of 1985, Chap. 590 &sect;9. Some commenters challenged, as contrary to the intent
of the Massachusetts law, the use of the Massachusetts emissions limitations to limit allowance allocations under
title IV. However, Congressional intent, not the intent of the Massachusetts legislature, is relevant to interpreting
title IV.

Some commenters argued that the Agency should distinguish between federal emissions limitations and State emissions
limitations and consider only federal limitations in allocating allowances to substitution units. They alleged
that it is unfair to ``penalize'' utilities in States ``tak[ing] the lead in controlling air emissions'' and that
title IV references federal, but not State, emissions limitations. Comments of Dairyland Power Cooperative at 2
(submitted Jan. 26, 1994). However, section 404(b)(5) requires that emissions reductions with the substitution
plan be no less than reductions without the plan and does not distinguish between reductions without the plan that
are due to State law from those due to federal law. Thus, contrary to the commenters, there is no basis for considering
only federal, and ignoring State, emissions limitations in applying section 404(b)(5). Further, the Agency reiterates
that:

[S]ince reliance on substitution plans is optional and the use of the most stringent allowable rate (in conjunction
with the 1985 actual or allowable rate and the [1989 or] 1990 actual rate) to allocate allowances under such plans is
necessary to meet statutory emissions reduction goals, it is difficult to see how such use of the most stringent allowable
rate could be viewed as unfair to utilities located in States that mandated reductions. This approach simply prevents
the creation of excess, new allowances and thereby ensures that reductions mandated by such States are not used to
increase emissions elsewhere above the levels that title IV was intended to achieve.

Using federal or State emissions limitations to limit a particular substitution unit's allowance allocation raises
certain questions, particularly where some emissions limitations are not unit specific. For example, under some
State laws (e.g., the acid rain laws for Massachusetts and Wisconsin), a utility has a maximum average emissions rate
for its units in the State. Under other State laws (e.g., for New Hampshire and Minnesota), a utility has a total tonnage
emissions cap for all its units in the State. Maximum average emissions rates or maximum total tonnage limits allow
utilities the flexibility to exceed such maximum rates or limits at individual units so long as the maximum rates or
limits are met on a utility-wide basis. Since individual units may exceed such maximum rates or limits, the Agency
concludes that it should not treat the maximum rates or limits as the most stringent limitation for each individual
unit. However, while utility-wide limitations provide some flexibility, such limitations impose bounds on the
emissions of individual units, albeit bounds that depend on the emissions from other units owned or operated by the
same utility. There is no basis for ignoring the fact that a unit may have to make emissions reductions because of a utility-wide
limitation, just as it may have to reduce emissions because of a unit-specific limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the final revised rule provides that the Agency will develop a method for using both the unit-specific
and non-unit-specific emissions limitations to limit the allocation of allowances to a substitution unit. This
method will not treat non-unit-specific limitations as if they were unit specific and will not allow allocation of
allowances for reductions that were necessary to meet non-unit-specific limitations. Because there are significant
differences among State laws and the manner in which they express non-unit-specific emissions limitations, the
final revised rule gives the Agency the authority to develop this method on a case-by-case basis for each proposed
substitution unit. This approach will give the Agency the flexibility to take account of variations among States
and will allow interested parties an opportunity, e.g., in proceedings on individual permits, to comment on the method
that the Agency proposes to use with regard to a particular non-unit-specific limitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters made specific recommendations concerning the method that EPA should use to apply the unit-specific
limitations under Wisconsin's acid rain law. Under the Wisconsin law, each major utility that generates electricity
in the State must achieve an annual average sulfur dioxide emissions rate that does not exceed 1.2 lbs per mmBtu starting
in 1995 from all fossil fuel-fired boilers under the utility's ownership or control. A Wisconsin utility that meets
certain requirements may trade emissions with another Wisconsin utility. One utility accepts_and adds to its annual
emissions_emissions from another utility, which subtracts those emissions from its annual emissions and thereby
reduces its annual average emissions rate in order to meet the utility-wide limit. Some commenters suggested that,
in initially allocating allowances to substitution units in Wisconsin, EPA consider only those Federal and State
limitations that are expressed as unit-specific limitations and not the utility-wide limits under Wisconsin's
acid rain law. These commenters supported an end-of-year review in which each Wisconsin utility will have to demonstrate
whether, if the allowances allocated to its substitution units in Wisconsin are treated as emissions by those units,
the utility will still be in compliance for that year with 1.2 lbs per mmBtu limit. In this demonstration, the utility
will sum the actual annual emissions of each boiler owned or controlled by the utility, except in the case of a substitution
unit where the allocated allowances will be used. Where emissions were traded for the year, traded emissions will
be subtracted by one utility from, and added by another utility to, the sum of emissions and allowances. The total will
be divided by the sum of the annual mmBtu utilization of all the boilers involved. To the extent that the result exceeds
1.2 lbs per mmBtu, the utility will be required to surrender, and EPA will deduct, allowances allocated to the substitution
units for that year. No commenters supported imposing limits on the ability to transfer the substitution unit's allowances
prior to the end-of-year review. However, one commenter opposed the use of any end-of-year review to apply the Wisconsin
utility-wide emissions limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is not deciding in the instant rulemaking what particular procedure will be used for applying non-specific
emissions limitations and whether to adopt an approach involving end-of-year review. However, such review may be
the best way to take account of the flexibility that the Wisconsin acid rain law and other State provisions provide
to individual units in meeting State emissions limitations. The final revised rule, therefore, allows EPA to decide
on a case-by-case basis, e.g., in individual permit proceedings on proposed substitution units, whether to require
end-of-year review to apply non-unit-specific emissions limitations. The final revised rule also authorizes the
Agency to require allowance surrender, and make allowance deductions, by the allowance transfer deadline as a result
of such review.

Contrary to one commenter's claim, the fact that section 402(3) of the Act defines ``allowance'' as ``an authorization

consistent with other sections of the Act, to surrender allowances. 42 U.S.C. 7651a(3). Section 403(f) of the Act

The Agency maintains that it is unnecessary to impose, pending any end-of-year review, limitations on the ability
to transfer a substitution unit's allowances. The risk that a substitution unit will not have allowances in its Allowance
Tracking System account to cover the deduction is small. As of the allowance transfer deadline, the unit's account
must contain, in any event, sufficient allowances to cover its emissions for the prior year. The deduction of allowances
resulting from the substitution unit's end-of-year review must be made before the Agency determines whether the
unit's emissions exceeded its available allowances. Consequently, the failure of the substitution unit to have
sufficient allowances to cover any deduction resulting from the end-of-year review will constitute a violation
of &sect;72.41 (and so the Clean Air Act itself) and will result in excess emissions and trigger excess emissions penalties.
Not only are limitations on transferability unnecesssary, but also they would reduce the compliance flexibility
that Congress intended to provide through substitution plans. The final rule therefore does not impose any limits
of transferability, pending any end-of-year review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, the Agency concludes that a substitution unit should be allocated allowances based on the lesser of four emissions
rates for the unit: 1985 actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate; the greater of 1989 or 1990 actual SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate, or the most stringent Federal or State allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate applicable in 1995&hyph;99 as of November 15, 1990. The first two emissions rates are set forth in section
404(b)(2) of the Act. The latter rates are added in order to ensure, in accordance with section 404(b)(5), that a substitution
plan will result in at least the same amount of reductions that would have occurred without the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach requires the submission to EPA of data on the 1989 and 1990 emissions rates and the emissions limitations
for 1995&hyph;99. For the reasons set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60956), the Agency maintains that
section 404(b) provides adequate authority to require submission of this data and to use the data to calculate the
allowance allocation under the plan.

c. Baseline. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the final revised rule, a substitution unit's allowance allocation is calculated by multiplying the lower
of the above-discussed emissions rates by the baseline, which reflects 1985&hyph;87 utilization. The January 11,
1993 regulations used baseline (and only the 1985 actual or allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate) to calculate the allowance allocation. In the November 18, 1993 preamble, the Agency discussed the
options of basing allocations on utilization at the time a permit application is submitted or requiring utilities
to project what future utilization of the substitution units would be in Phase I without the substitution plan and
using the projected utilization to allocate allowances. No commenters supported the use of projected utilization,
and those that specifically addressed the matter preferred continued use of baseline. For the reasons set forth in
the preamble (58 FR 60956&hyph;57), the Agency concludes that a substitution unit's baseline should continue to
be used to calculate the allowance allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Limiting the Number of Substitution Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency rejects modifications of the January 11, 1993 regulations making upfront approval of the designation
of substitution units and allocation of allowances to such units contingent on an end-of-year review of the need for
such units for each year that the plan was in effect. Under such an approach, the Agency would allow only those designations
of substitution units that actually proved to be needed. No commenters supported that approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because allowance allocations for substitution units are limited as discussed above, the Agency concludes that
requiring end-of-year review of the need for substitution units and thereby limiting the number of such units is unnecessary.
If a substitution unit is not allocated allowances for emissions rate reductions that would have occurred without
a substitution plan, then the unit will use up all or most of its allocated allowances unless the unit made new emissions
rate reductions that would not otherwise have been made. To the extent that a substitution unit frees up allowances
by making such new emissions rate reductions, section 404(b)(1)(5) is not violated. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60957. In short, because today's final rule prevents any substitution unit from creating new, excess allowances,
there is no need to impose further requirements limiting the number of substitution units.

3. Requirement That the Substitution Unit Be Under Control of the Table A Unit's Owner or Operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that the statutory requirement that the substitution unit be under the control
of the Table A unit's owner or operator is satisfied where such units have only a common designated representative.
This was based on the determination that a common designated representative qualifies, in such cases as an operator.
40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). In the November 18, 1993 preamble, the Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having
a common designated representative, without more, meets this statutory requirement and to revise the regulations
accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. The Agency today adopts the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and in the preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;55), that a designated representative
is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Agency stated that, under some circumstances, a designated
representative's ``duties and level of responsibility can be equivalent to that of an operator.'' 58 FR 3600. One
such case, identified by the Agency, was where a designated representative represents multiple sources participating
in a substitution plan and otherwise lacking the same owner or operator. In that case, the designated representative's
responsibilities are allegedly ``broad enough to bring him or her within the definition of operator.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the November 18, 1993 proposal and the March 22, 1994 final NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule, a designated representative's responsibilities in a multi-source substitution plan are not actually any
broader or more complex than they are under other compliance options. Therefore, there is no basis for treating a designated
representative in such a substitution plan any differently than a designated representative under any other compliance
option. In all such cases, a designated representative is not an operator. The final revised rule reflects this conclusion
by eliminating language from the January 11, 1993 regulations that provided that units with a common designated representative,
and nothing more, could participate in a substitution plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters note that, although &sect;72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have
``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) itself states that the substitution
unit must be ``under the control of the owner or operator'' of the Table A unit. They argue that, in implementing section
404 (b) and (c), the Agency should focus on whether there is such control. They suggest that the ownership of the units
is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They allege that, on one hand, where the
units have multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met. On the other hand,
where the units lack the same owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual
arrangements under which the owner and operator of the substitution unit commit, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this final rule, the Agency is not addressing these additional issues concerning under what circumstances a proposed
substitution unit is considered to be under the control of the owners or operator of a Phase I unit. EPA is addressing
these issues, and the related comments, in a separate direct final rule in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In order to preserve these issues for resolution, the Agency is adopting, in today's final rule, the statutory language
requiring that the owner or operator of the Phase I unit ``control'' the substitution unit that it designates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Other Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has adopted several other minor changes to clarify the current &sect;72.41. For example, as discussed
above, a substitution plan may distribute allowances between the substitution unit and the Table A unit. The final
rule makes it clear in &sect;72.41(c)(4)(ii) that, where there is more than one Table A unit in a plan, allowances may
be distributed from a substitution unit only to the Table A unit that designated that substitution unit. The final
rule also eliminates the superfluous, but potentially confusing, final sentence in that section of the January 11,
1993 rules because the sentence simply repeats the limitation in &sect;72.41(c)(3)(ii) on the total number of allowances
available under a substitution plan.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 11, 1993 regulations implementing substitution and reduced utilization plans pose similar problems
concerning the creation of excess, new allowances. However, because section 408(c)(1)(B) of the Act (unlike sections
404(b) and (c)) specifies the formula for allocating allowances, the Agency is adopting a different approach in modifying
the requirements for compensating units than the one adopted today for substitution units. In order to ensure that
reduced utilization plans are used as a means of accounting for emissions from load shifting from Phase I units and
not as a method of creating excess, new allowances through early entry of Phase II units into Phase I, the Agency must
limit the circumstances under which Phase II units can become compensating units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency suggested two options for limiting the designation
of compensating units: the first option requiring that the compensating units be actually needed to compensate for
reduced utilization and involving an end-of-year review of need; and the second option limiting up-front the category
of units that can qualify to become compensating units. The Agency is today rejecting the first option and is adopting
the second option with some modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Limiting the Category of Units That Can Qualify as Compensating Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the option (Option 2 in the November 18, 1993 proposal) adopted today with some changes, the category of units
that may be designated as compensating units is limited to those units whose designation cannot create excess, new
allowances. The final revised rule provides that a unit can be designated as a compensating unit only if (1) the unit's
baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual or allowable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate does not exceed (2) the baseline multiplied by the lesser of (i) the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990
actual SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for 1995&hyph;99 as of November 15, 1990 plus (iii) the lesser of 10 percent of the tonnage calculated under (1) or 200
tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with its conclusions concerning substitution units, the Agency maintains that excess allowances may
be created by the designation, as a compensating unit, of any Phase II unit whose baseline, multiplied by what its annual
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate in Phase I would be in the absence of the designation, is less than the annual allowances allocated to
the unit as a compensating unit. Even if such a Phase II unit increases its own generation to provide compensating generation,
the unit may be able to use its own allowance allocation to cover its own emissions without making any more emission
rate reductions than it would have otherwise made. In addition, the unit may have extra allowances to transfer, sell,
or bank for future use. In order to prevent the creation of excess, new allowances, such units will not be allowed to
be designated as compensating units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, the Agency concludes that excess, new allowances are created when Phase II units
entering Phase I (e.g., compensating units) are allocated allowances for emissions rate reductions made, or mandated
by federal or State law adopted, before passage of title IV. The general approach in the final rule is to bar, from becoming
compensating units, those units that would otherwise receive such allocations if they were compensating units.
Units that qualify as compensating units will be allocated allowances under the formula in section 408(c)(1)(B),
i.e., baseline times the 1985 actual or allowable emissions rate.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, despite the claim of some commenters, Option 2 of the proposal does not change the allocation formula, which
applies once it is determined that a unit qualifies as a compensating unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Contrary to some commenters, section 408(c)(1)(B) does not require the Administrator to approve whatever units
a utility designates as compensating for reduced utilization. The Administrator must approve only those compensating-unit
designations that are consistent with the purposes of title IV. 42 U.S.C. 7651h(c)(2). Section 408(c)(1)(B) does
not expressly require the Administrator to consider a unit's 1989 or 1990 actual emissions rate or its most stringent
emissions limitation. However, in reviewing proposed compensating units using these factors, the Agency is implementing
section 408(c)(1)(B) in a way that precludes ``a pattern or practice''_i.e., designation of compensating units
that would receive excess, new allowances_``that is counter to the intent of section 404 and *&blank;*&blank;* title
[IV of the Act].'' Senate Rep. 101&hyph;228 at 334. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach is similar to that adopted with regard to substitution units except that, while the final rule allows
units to become substitution units and adjusts their allocations, the final rule completely bars certain units from
becoming compensating units. Consistent with the provisions concerning substitution units, the provisions for
compensating units use the greater of the unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate as reasonably reflecting voluntary emissions
reductions made before passage of title IV. Similarly, the provisions for substitution units and the provisions
for compensating units take the same approach (including the treatment of non-unit-specific emissions limitations)
to using the most stringent federal or State emissions limitations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section III(A)(1)(b) of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because some units could otherwise be completely barred from becoming compensating units because of very
small differences (e.g., due to normal variability in coal quality) between their 1985 emissions and their actual
or mandated emissions as of the passage of title IV, the Agency is building some extra flexibility into the provisions
governing compensating units. The final rule allows the designation of compensating units whose baseline times
the 1985 emissions rate is greater by only a very small amount (i.e., the lesser of 10 percent or 200 tons) than their
baseline times the lesser of their 1989 (or 1990) emissions rate or their most stringent emissions limitation for
Phase I. The flexibility band is measured in tons of emissions in order to ensure that the potential for creating excess,
new allowances is restricted. Further, the flexibility band is also limited as a percentage of 1985 emissions because
the band must apply to all potential compensating units, which can vary significantly in size and thus in total emissions.
Using only a percentage limit or only a specific tonnage would have an inconsistent impact on units of different sizes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the inherent unreliability of projected utilization figures (discussed above in section III(A)(1)(c)
of this preamble), baseline, not projected utilization, will be used to determine whether a unit qualifies as a compensating
unit. If a utilization projection less than baseline were used to determine that a unit qualified as a compensating
unit but subsequently the unit had a higher actual utilization in Phase I that would have otherwise disqualified the
unit, the unit could create excess, new allowances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to be approved, the designation of a compensating unit, of course, must meet the requirements in the January
11, 1993 regulations for reduced utilization plans as well as the additional requirement imposed in today's final
revised rule. After determining that a particular proposed compensating unit meets all these upfront requirements,
the Agency will approve the designation and allocate allowances for the unit. The Agency will not conduct any end-of-year
review of the need for the compensating unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a designated representative of a Phase I unit has no Phase II unit that will provide compensating generation and
that meets all the upfront requirements for designation, the designated representative will not be required to submit
a reduced utilization plan designating a compensating unit. The allowance surrender provisions in &sect;&sect;72.91
and 72.92 will continue to apply.

2. End-of-Year Review of the Need for Compensating Units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the rejected option (Option 1 in the November 18, 1993 proposal), units would have been allowed to remain as compensating
units and would have retained allocated allowances only where the compensating units were actually needed to account
for reduced utilization. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60959&hyph;60961. The Agency proposed in Option 1 to modify the reduced utilization provisions by granting
upfront approval of a reduced utilization plan with compensating units but making approval contingent on an end-of-year
determination by the Administrator that each compensating unit was needed for the year. A unit designated as a compensating
unit would have become a Phase I unit and would have been allocated allowances upon upfront approval of the reduced
utilization plan. However, a compensating unit would not have been allowed to transfer allowances allocated for
any given year in Phase I unless and until an end-of-year determination of need was made for that unit for that year.
If the unit was not shown to be needed, the unit would have been retroactively de-designated for the year and the allowances
allocated for the year would have been deducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Option 1, a unit could be deemed, in the end-of-year review, to be needed as a compensating unit only for years
in which: the Phase I unit actually had utilization below baseline; the Phase I units in the initial Phase I unit's dispatch
system actually had total net utilization below the sum of their baselines after taking account of all sulfur-generation
acquired by the dispatch system; and the proposed compensating unit actually provided compensating generation
to that dispatch system. Further, the Administrator would determine how much compensating generation each compensating
unit proposed for any Phase I unit potentially could have provided. The only compensating unit designations that
would be allowed for any Phase I units in the dispatch system would be designations of compensating units whose potential
excess generation would have been necessary to meet the potential need for compensating generation for the dispatch
system as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is rejecting Option 1 because Option 2 is a simpler approach that ensures that, consistent with title IV
and Congressional intent, compensating units cannot be used to create excess, new allowances. In contrast to Option
2, Option 1 would require designated representatives to make complicated end-of-year demonstrations of need, summarized
above, and EPA to review and evaluate those demonstrations. Trading of allowances allocated to compensating units
would be inhibited in that such trading would be barred pending completion of the Agency's review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Further, while Option 1 would reduce the number of compensating units and thus the total amount of excess, new allowances
that they could create, that option would not entirely eliminate the problem: those compensating units meeting the
requirements of Option 1 could still create some excess, new allowances. Finally, the vast majority of commenters
supported the use of Option 2 over Option 1.

Commenters addressed only two of these changes. Under the proposal and the final revised rule, where a sulfur-free
generator is designated outside a unit's dispatch system, the designated representative must submit, as part of
the reduced utilization plan, the contractual agreements governing the ``acquisition'' of electricity by the unit's
dispatch system from that generator. In addition, where a shift of generation from any designated sulfur-free generator
(whether the generator is within or outside the dispatch system) is claimed, the designated representative must
document that at least the amount claimed to have been shifted was actually ``acquired'' by the unit's dispatch system
from the generator. The January 11, 1993 regulations referred to the contractual agreements governing and documentation
concerning the ``purchase'', rather than the ``acquisition'', of electricity from sulfur-free generators.

 48 FR 3672 and 3682 (&sect;&sect;72.43(c)(4)(iv) and 72.91(a)(6) (1993)). Commenters supported this change adopted
in the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some sulfur-free generators have multiple owners and may be owned in part by the
unit's dispatch system. In such cases, the unit's dispatch system may not acquire electricity from the generator
through a ``purchase'' but rather may acquire the electricity based on its ownership share. Further, it is important
to ensure that multiple owners of sulfur-free generators claim only their respective shares of the sulfur-free generation.
Consequently, the Agency is requiring documentation concerning the ``acquisition,'' which encompasses not only
``purchases'' (as under the January 11, 1993 rule) but also acquisitions based on ownership. Further, the requirement
to document actual acquisition applies to all designated sulfur-free generators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the documentation required, under the proposal, for acquisition of sulfur-free generation
is more stringent than necessary. The commenter noted that, under the proposal, the designated representative must
demonstrate that electricity was actually acquired from ``a particular sulfur-free generator.'' Comments of Oglethorpe
Power Corporation at 7. Allegedly, it is ``extremely difficult to trace energy back'' to the sulfur-free generator.

The commenter further alleged that requiring that ``a unit power or similar power sale agreement'' govern the acquisition
will result in ``significant regulatory or other approval delays.''

at 6. The commenter suggested that, instead of these requirements, the Agency require that the designated representative
of the Phase I unit simply obtain the consent of an owner of the sulfur-free generator to claim, for purposes of the reduced
utilization plan, some or all of that owner's share of generation from the sulfur-free generator. In order to ensure
that the designated representative does not make such claims without actually getting the consent of the generator-owner,
the commenter urged that EPA require that a copy of any reduced utilization plan involving a sulfur-free generator
be given to all owners of the generator and the designated representative of the Phase I unit certify to EPA that the
necessary consent was obtained.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the commenter's approach, a Phase I unit would be relieved of the obligation to surrender allowances simply
because it obtained the consent of an owner of a sulfur-free generator to ``claim'' some of that owner's electricity
from the generator. As explained by the commenter, there would not have to be any actual acquisition of electricity
by the dispatch system of the Phase I unit from the sulfur-free generator. However, the rationale for allowing the
Phase I unit to avoid surrendering allowances if it designates a sulfur-free generator is that the Phase I unit is replacing
the reduction in its own generation below its 1985&hyph;87 level with electricity from a source (i.e., a sulfur-free
generator) that does not emit any sulfur dioxide when producing that electricity. To the extent the Phase I unit replaces
its own reduced generation with electricity from units that emit sulfur dioxide in the process, allowances must be
surrendered in order to account for the emissions consequences of the reduced utilization of the Phase I unit. Otherwise,
the Phase I unit could bank its unused allowances ``notwithstanding the fact that actual emissions reductions had
not been paid for or achieved'' at that unit. 56 FR 63019. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency recognizes that the complexity of the movement of electricity through interconnected transmission and
distribution systems make it difficult to determine precisely the source of compensating generation. 56 FR 63023.
That does not mean that all efforts, in the allowance surrender procedure, to reflect actual electricity transactions
and to approximate resulting emissions should be abandoned. Under the commenter's approach, ``paper'' claims to
sulfur-free generation that may have no actual, underlying energy transactions could be used to avoid allowance
surrender. Such an approach would run contrary to the rationale for allowing the designation of sulfur-free generators
and therefore is rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the final revised rule includes the requirements that the designated representative of the Phase I unit submit:
Contractual agreements that expressly provide for the acquisition of electricity by the unit's dispatch system
from the designated sulfur-free generator outside the dispatch system, which generator must be identified in the
agreements; and documentation that such acquisition from the identified generator actually took place. (Similarly,
to ensure that claims of compensating generation are based on actual transactions, the same approach is taken for
compensating units outside the dispatch system. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 60961 (proposing parallel treatment of sulfur-free generators and compensating units).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these requirements, commenter's concern_that Phase I units lacking a common owner with a sulfur-free
generator may claim to have acquired from the generator electricity that is actually sulfur-free generation retained
by an owner of the generator_is misplaced. A sulfur-free generator can be designated only by those Phase I units that
meet certain requirements. A Phase I unit whose dispatch system includes the generator may designate that generator.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the generator is outside the dispatch system of a Phase I unit, the Phase I unit may designate the generator if the
dispatch system has a contract specifically providing for the acquisition of electricity from the particular generator.
A contact to purchase power from the dispatch system of an owner of the sulfur-free generator, where the sulfur-free
generator is not specified as the source of the power, is not sufficient. If the dispatch system of the Phase I unit has
a contract specifically to purchase power generated at the sulfur-free generator and the contract is with a third
party that is not an owner of the generator, the designated representative must show that the third party in turn has
an agreement with an owner of the generator specifically to purchase power from the generator. Further, &sect;72.91(a)
(5) and (6) require that the designated representative document the amount of power actually acquired from the sulfur-free
generator and that the designated representatives of all Phase I units claiming generation from the same generator
must agree on apportionment of the available generation. It is difficult to see how a Phase I unit could take credit
for electricity legitimately claimed by an owner of the sulfur-free generator. Consequently, it is unnecessary
to impose the additional requirements suggested by the commenter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
No contract to acquire power from the sulfur-free generator is required if the generator is in the Phase I unit's dispatch
system. Since a given sulfur-free generator can be included in only one dispatch system, Phase I units in any other
dispatch system must have such a contract in order to desigate the generator.

IV. Applicability of Rule Revisions to Existing Permit Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency requested comment on how to address any reliance by owners and operators
on the January 11, 1993 regulations. The Agency noted that it had proposed in draft Acid Rain permits to approve for
1995, under the January 11, 1993 regulations, those substitution plans and those reduced utilization plans with
compensating units that EPA determined to be in compliance with those regulations. 58 FR 60962. In a subsequent extension
of the period for comments on the November 18, 1993 proposal, the Agency requested comments on whether any of the allowances
allocated to substitution or compensating units under the January 11, 1993 regulations should be returned to EPA
at some future time. 59 FR 3660 (Jan. 26, 1994).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the November 18, 1993 proposal, it was also noted that, in the draft permits, EPA had proposed to defer action on those
compliance options with regard to 1996&hyph;1999 pending completion of the instant rulemaking. 58 FR 60962&hyph;60963.
In notices of draft permits, the Agency had stated that it intended to take this approach for all substitution and reduced
utilization plans submitted before July 16, 1993 but that, with regard to such plans submitted on or after July 16,
1993, it intended to defer action for all of Phase I on those compliance options until completion of the rulemaking.
58 FR 38371 (July 16, 1993); 58 FR 39542&hyph;39543 (July 23, 1993); 58 FR 40812 (July 30, 1993); 58 FR 42065 (Aug. 6,
1993); 58 FR 43107 (Aug. 13, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency had explained in draft permits, notices of draft permits, and the November 18, 1993 proposal that it was
taking the position that it had the authority under the January 11, 1993 regulations to defer action on compliance
options.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 See, e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58 FR 60963. Nevertheless, the Agency proposed, in the November 18, 1993 notice of proposed rulemaking, to add language
to &sect;&sect;72.62 and 72.82 of the January 11, 1993 regulations ``making this authority more explicit.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency concludes that it is no longer necessary to defer action for any period on any substitution or reduced
utilization plans that have been submitted. The Agency has already issued direct final permits addressing these
plans for all years during 1995&hyph;1999 for which the plans were proposed. See, e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 37755 (July 25, 1994); 59 FR 38454 (July 28, 1994); 59 FR 39339 (Aug. 2, 1994); and 59 FR 39767 (Aug. 4, 1994). Most
of the permits automatically became final. Significant, adverse comment was received on several permits, which
were reproposed and have now been issued in final form. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 49395&hyph;49396 (Sept. 28, 1994). As provided in the May 4, 1994 settlement, the substitution and compensating
units designated in the plans are allocated allowances in Phase I under settlement provisions consistent with today's
final revised rule and receive for one or two years any additional allowances (referred to, in the settlement, as ``excess''
allowances) that would be provided under the January 11, 1993 regulations. Consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement,
allowances equal to the number of additional allowances allocated for one or two years will be deducted from a future
year subaccount in the unit's Allowance Tracking System account. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the Agency is withdrawing its position, set forth in draft permits, notices of draft permits, and the
November 18, 1993 proposal, that it has the authority under the January 11, 1993 regulations to defer action on compliance
options. The Agency is taking no position at this time on whether it has such authority. Further, under these circumstances,
the Agency is not adopting the revisions to &sect;&sect;72.62 and 72.82 as proposed on November 18, 1993. The comments
that were submitted on these proposed revisions and on the Agency's authority to defer action on compliance options
are therefore no longer relevant and require no response at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Agency is not addressing, in this rulemaking, questions concerning whether and how to apply today's
final revised rule to permit applications submitted to the Agency prior to the effective date of the final revised
rule. These matters_including the question of whether allowances allocated to substitution or compensating units
under the January 11, 1993 rules should be returned to EPA in the future_were addressed when, as noted above, the final
permits were issued with regard to these permit applications. The Agency considered, in the individual permit application
proceedings, both the comments on this matter submitted in this rulemaking and those comments submitted on the draft
permits.

Under Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735 (Oct. 4, 1993), the Administrator must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements

Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory
action'' because the rule seems to raise novel legal or policy issues. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for
review. Any changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations are documented in the public record. Any
written comments from OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments are included in the docket. The docket

, requires each federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.''
Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public
comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that
a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including
the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions
adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11,
1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. The revisions will prevent the creation
of about 200,000 excess, new allowances and thus will have an annual impact of about $318,000 per year in Phase I, i.e.,
200,000 allowances times $159 (the weighted average winning bid for 1995 allowances in the EPA 1994 Allowance Auction

limitation and will not result in compensating units retaining allowances allocated under paragraph (d)(1) of this
section for emissions reductions necessary to meet a non-unit-specific emissions limitation. Such method may require
an end-of-year review and the disapproval and de-designation, and adjustment of the allowances allocated to, the

(iii) ``Shifts to designated sulfur-free generators'' is the reduction in utilization (in mmBtu), for the calendar
year, that is accounted for by all sulfur-free generators designated under the reduced utilization plan in effect
for the calendar year. This term equals the sum, for all such generators, of the ``shift to sulfur-free generator.''
``Shift to sulfur-free generator'' shall equal the amount, to the extent documented under paragraph (a)(6) of this

(iv) ``Shifts to designated compensating units'' is the reduction in utilization (in mmBtu) for the calendar year

in effect for the calendar year. This term equals the heat rate, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, of the unit
reducing utilization multiplied by the sum, for all such compensating units, of the ``shift to compensating unit''
for each compensating unit. ``Shift to compensating unit'' shall equal the amount of compensating generation (in
Kwh), to the extent documented under paragraph (a)(6) of this section, that the designated representatives of the
unit reducing utilization and the compensating unit have certified (in their respective annual compliance certification
reports) as the amount that will be converted to mmBtus and used, in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section,
in calculating the adjusted utilization for the compensating unit.

(4) ``Compensating generation provided to other units'' is the total amount of utilization (in mmBtu) necessary
to provide the generation (if any) that was shifted to the unit as a designated compensating unit under any other reduced
utilization plans that were in effect for the unit and for the calendar year. This term equals the heat rate, under paragraph
(a)(3) of this section, of such unit multiplied by the sum of each ``shift to compensating unit'' that is attributed
to the unit in the annual compliance certification reports submitted by the Phase I units under such other plans and
that is certified under paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101&hyph;549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act),
authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11,
1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules.
On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility
of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that
is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and
that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be
designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table
A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' The Agency is
revising the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the statutory ``control''
requirement for substitution plans is met. The rule revision is being issued as a direct final rule because it is consistent
with the August 10, 1994 settlement and no adverse comment is expected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act set forth the requirements for submission and approval of substitution plans, under
which a unit listed on Table A of section 404 designates one or more non-Table A units as substitution units and brings
them into Phase I of the Acid Rain Program. Congress established substitution plans as a compliance option to increase
units' compliance flexibility and reduce their overall costs of compliance in Phase I while still achieving the emissions
reductions intended by Congress under title IV. See 58 FR 60950&hyph;60951 (Nov. 18, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A substitution plan allows the owner or operator of a Table A unit to reassign the unit's emissions reduction obligations
to a designated non-Table A unit ``under the control of'' that owner or operator. 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). Upon approval
of the reassignment, the non-Table A unit becomes subject to all requirements for Phase I units with regard to sulfur
dioxide and is allocated allowances. Emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit may therefore free up allowances,
which may be used by the Table A unit (or any other unit) in lieu of making emissions reductions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 71.41 of the January 11, 1993 regulations provided that the statutory requirement of control by the Table
A unit's owner or operator over the non-Table A unit is satisfied where such units have ``the same owner or operator.''
40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993). The regulation also provided that having the same designated representative would
be treated as having the same operator and would thus meet the control requirement.

; see also 58 FR 3600. On March 12, 1993, petitions for review of the January 11, 1993 regulations were filed with the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several petitioners challenged the provisions implementing
the control requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 18, 1993, the Agency issued proposed revisions to the January 11, 1993 regulations, including the provisions
concerning the control requirement. The Agency proposed to reverse its interpretation that having a common designated
representative alone meets the statutory control requirement for substitution plans and to revise the regulations
accordingly. 58 FR 60957&hyph;60958. Several commenters addressed the control requirement in their comments on
the November 18, 1993 proposal. Some commenters opposed any change in the January 11, 1993 provisions concerning
the control requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters noted that, although &sect;72.41(b)(1)(i) requires that the substitution and Table A units have
``the same owner or operator'' (40 CFR 72.41(b)(1)(i) (1993)), section 404(b) of the Act requires that the substitution
unit be under the control of the Table A unit owner or operator. They argued that, in implementing section 404(b) and
(c), the Agency should also focus on whether there is such control. They suggested that common ownership of the units
is not necessarily determinative of whether the control requirement is met. They alleged that where the units have
multiple owners only one of which is in common, the control requirement may not be met, e.g., where the common owner
owns only a very small percentage of the proposed substitution unit. On the other hand, where the units lack any common
owner or operator, the control requirement allegedly may be met through contractual arrangements under which the
owner and operator of the substitution unit commit, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to make emissions reductions and deliver allowances to the owner and operator of the Phase I unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate final rule in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Agency adopted the reasoning, set forth in the November 18, 1993 preamble (58 FR 60957&hyph;60958) and in the
preamble of the Acid Rain regulations on nitrogen oxides (59 FR 13554&hyph;13555 (Mar. 22, 1994)), that a designated
representative is not, merely by holding that position, also an operator. In that separate final rule, the Agency
revised the January 11, 1993 regulations to use the statutory language requiring control by the Table A unit owner
or operator and to provide that having a common designated representative does not alone meet the control requirement
for substitution units. However, the Agency did not address in that separate document comments raising issues concerning:
under what circumstances the existence of one or more common owners satisfies the control requirement; and whether
and, if so, under what circumstances control can be established by contract if there are no common owners or common
operators. The Agency addresses below those issues and the comments on those issues.

II. Modifications of the January 11, 1993 Regulation Concerning the Control Requirement for Substitution Units
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Control by Common Owner or Operator
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 404(b) of the Act allows that the ``owner or operator'' of a Table A unit to designate, as a substitution unit,
a non-Table A unit ``under the control of such owner or operator.'' 42 U.S.C. 7651c(b). The Agency agrees with commenters
that, like section 404(b), the regulation implementing that section should focus on whether such control exists.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because many units have multiple owners with varying percentages of ownership, there is a wide range of possible relationships
between a Table A unit and a non-Table A unit, ranging, for example, from no common ownership to 100% common ownership
and including all the possible variations in between. In order to avoid burdensome case-by-case determinations
of whether each particular set of facts meets the control requirement and in order to provide more certainty for utilities
and the public concerning what units qualify for inclusion in substitution plans, the Agency is establishing generic
criteria for applying the control requirement. Further, the generic criteria are based on the potential ability
of owners and operators to exercise control, not the actual exercise of such control potential. Determining what
entities actually make decisions governing the operation of a unit could require the Agency to make lengthy case-by-case
inquiries into the details of utility operations and involve the Agency in matters beyond its expertise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In taking this approach, the Agency maintains that section 404(b) should be interpreted to require that owners or
operators of a Table A unit have the ability to exercise a significant degree of control over a non-Table A unit. The
simplest case for applying this requirement is where the Table A and non-Table A units have only a single owner or where,
regardless of their ownership, the units have a common operator. Under these circumstances, it seems clear that the
single owner or the operator of the Table A unit has the ability to control the non-Table A unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For units with multiple owners, the application of the control requirement becomes somewhat more complex if they
do not have a common operator. If one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit own an aggregate share of 50% or more
of the capacity of a non-Table A unit, no major decisions concerning the unit can be made without the concurrence of
such Table A unit owners and operators. The Agency maintains, therefore, that they can control the non-Table A unit
to a significant extent and meet the control requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even where the aggregate ownership share of the one or more owners and operators of a Table A unit in a non-Table A unit
is less than 50%, the degree of control may still be significant. Such control is evidenced by the ability of such non-Table
A unit owners to determine the dispatch of their respective shares of electricity generated by the non-Table A unit.
Decisions by such owners whether or not to take their shares of generation can significantly affect the overall operation
of the unit. While the Agency recognizes that adopting a minimum level of ownership in the non-Table A unit for meeting
the control requirement is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, the Agency maintains that, as a matter of logic, there
is some level of ownership below which the owners lack significant control. Further, establishing such a minimum
level of ownership discourages gaming through the acquisition of minute ownership shares simply to enable the new
owner to qualify the non-Table A unit as a substitution unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more, and less than 50%, of the capacity of the non-Table
A unit meets the control requirement, provided that such owners have the ability to determine how their respective
shares of the non-Table A unit's generation are dispatched. The Agency notes that, in some regions of the country,
utilities have entered into power pool agreements under which the utilities agree to centralize in the power pool
the dispatch of their units. Power pools with central economic dispatch enable member utilities to minimize operating
costs through the use of the units in the pool that have the lowest generation costs. In light of the important benefits
of such power pools, the Agency maintains that utilities in power pools should not be disadvantaged under section
404(b). Consequently, the determination of whether owners of a non-Table A unit have, by right of contract, the ability
to dispatch their respective shares of the unit's generation should be made without regard to whether owners that
had contractual dispatch authority have surrendered that authority to a power pool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, the Agency is establishing generic criteria for determining whether the control requirement under section
404(b) is met. The first category that meets this requirement is where one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit
have an aggregate ownership interest of 50% or more in the non-Table A unit or where the two units have a common operator.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The second category that meets the control requirement is where: a Table A and non-Table A unit lack a common operator;
one or more owners or operators of a Table A unit have an aggregate ownership interest of 10% or more and less than 50%
in the non-Table A unit; and such owners or operators have the contractual ability to determine the dispatch of their
respective shares of the non-Table A unit's generation. The final regulation requires the designated representatives
submitting substitution plans to state in the submission what category is applicable to the units in the plan and to
provide, upon request, documentation supporting such statements. These statements, like all information included
in submissions by the designated representative, are covered by the certification required under &sect;72.21(b)
concerning the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the statements.

In summing the ownership shares of individual Table A unit owners and operators in the capacity of a non-Table unit,
a given share, and the generation associated with such share, obviously cannot be double-counted. Otherwise, the
sum of the ownership shares of all persons owning a non-Table A unit could exceed 100%.

B. Control by Contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency agrees that, under certain circumstances, control over a substitution unit by the owners and operators
of the Table A unit may be established by contract where the above-described criteria based on a common operator or
the level of common ownership are not met. The contract must be a binding agreement between the owners and operators
of a Table A unit and the owners and operators of the non-Table A unit that is designated as the Table A unit's substitution
unit. Several commenters supported an interpretation of section 404(b) that would allow the control requirement
to be met through a contract. The final regulation specifies the circumstances under which the Administator will
find that control is established by contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several determinations have guided the Agency's development of the regulation concerning control by contract.
First, the Agency believes that the regulation should set forth detailed, generic requirements for establishing
control by contract. Leaving the specification of detailed requirements to case-by-case development would increase
the burden both on the owners and operators interested in submitting contract-based substitution plans and on the
Agency, which must review such submissions. A commenter supporting the approval of contract-based substitution
plans suggested that the Agency develop generic criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Agency believes that the control requirement of section 404(b) of the Act should be interpreted in light
of the emissions reduction goals of title IV. The Agency maintains that a determination of whether control is established
by contract should focus on whether the owners and operators of the Table A unit have the ability, under the contract,
to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit and thereby to affect the overall operation of the unit. It
is not necessary in this context for the Table A unit's owners and operators to have contractual authority over all
facets of the non-Table A unit's day-to-day operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, if the control requirement is to be met by simply showing that Table A unit owners and operators have the ability,
by contract, to require emissions reductions by the non-Table A unit, the Agency maintains that the contract must
require emissions reductions that are significant, new reductions that would not otherwise have been implemented
by the non-Table A unit. It is difficult to see how control could be demonstrated if a contract with a Table A unit merely
required a non-Table A unit to ``make'' reductions that the non-Table A unit had already implemented, was already
in the process of implementing, or would have implemented even in the absence of the contract. Further, because a unit
might be able to realize relatively minor reductions while making little change in its operations, the scale of the
reductions required by contract should be significant in order to demonstrate control of the non-Table A unit by owners
and operators that otherwise lack any operational responsibilities for that unit. A commenter suggested that the
contract between the Table A and non-Table A units should specify a percentage emissions rate reduction that the non-Table
A unit is required to achieve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the contract requires significant, new reductions by the non-Table A unit, the final regulation requires
that the contract establish a maximum annual average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate for the unit. The maximum emissions rate must be less than or equal to 70% of the lesser of the following
emissions rates for the non-Table A unit: the 1985 actual SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The latter set of emissions rates (i.e., the current actual and allowable rates) are included to ensure that the required
reduction in the unit's emissions rate is at least 30% of the emissions rate achieved, or required to be achieved, by
the non-Table A unit around the time of the submission of the substitution plan. The other emissions rates (i.e., those
for 1985, 1989, 1990, and Phase I) are used to ensure that the current actual or allowable rate does not represent a spike
in the emissions rate achieved by or required for the unit since 1985.

Some units are subject to a non-unit-specific emissions limit (e.g., a utility-wide emissions tonnage or rate limit).
The final regulation provides that if such a unit is designated as a substitution unit in a contract-based substitution
plan, the Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis how to apply the non-unit-specific limit in setting
the maximum annual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, these other emissions rates are also used to allocate allowances for any substitution unit and to ensure that allowances

The Agency maintains that a 30% reduction in the emissions rate that the non-Table A unit would otherwise achieve represents
a significant reduction. A commenter supporting approval of contract-based substitution plans asserted that it
has identified about 30 Phase II units that lack a common owner or operator with a Table A unit and for which such plans
would be economically feasible. The commenter stated that this group of units could reduce their current emissions
rates by 50 to 70% and indicated that a 30% reduction might be an acceptable requirement for approval of this type of
substitution plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a further means of ensuring that the non-Table A unit's reductions are new, the final regulation requires that the
contract-based substitution plan include a description of the actions that will be undertaken so that the non-Table
A unit will comply with the maximum emissions rate. Such actions may include, for example, the addition or modification
of a scrubber or fuel switching. The owners and operators of the Table A and non-Table A units must show that the described
actions will not be implemented in Phase I unless the non-Table A unit is approved as a substitution unit. The description
of the actions that will be taken must be sufficiently detailed so that the Agency can determine whether the showing
has been made. Information relevant to the showing includes, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, whether contracts implementing these actions were entered into before submission of the substitution plan. Under
the regulation, the owners and operators must implement the described actions but may seek to amend the substitution
plan to change the required actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the Agency maintains that it is difficult to make determinations, particularly in a large number of cases,
of whether owners and operators will take certain future actions in the absence of a substitution plan. However, the
Agency must make a determination of this type in reviewing the actions described in each contract-based substitution
plan in order to make sure that the non-Table A unit is really obligated to make new reductions. This will be a one-time
determination made when the plan is approved (or disapproved) unless the designated representative subsequently
seeks to modify the description of actions in the plan. Further, the Agency does not expect a large number of contract-based
substitution plans to be submitted. As noted above, commenters have identified only about 30 units for which such
a plan would be economic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, it is important to ensure that the contract imposes an effective emissions reduction requirement_i.e.,
a requirement that is likely to be enforced by Table A unit owners and operators claiming control of the non-Table A
unit. Consequently, the contract should include a meaningful remedy in the event that the required emissions reductions
are not achieved. The concept of requiring a meaningful remedy in the event of default was supported by a commenter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender allowances to the Administrator to the extent that the non-Table
A unit fails to make the required emissions reductions, then the Table A owners and operators will bear responsibility
for the reductions that they claim to control and will have the incentive to take actions to ensure achievement of the
reductions. This puts the Table A owners and operators in a position similar to that of owners and operators that control
a unit directly by owning or operating the unit. If, instead of such allowance surrender by the Table A unit, the non-Table
A unit had to give allowances to the Table A unit (or to the Agency), then the Table A unit owners and operators would bear
no responsibility for the non-Table A unit that they claim to control. Further, without elaborate limitations on
the transfer of allowances between the Table A and non-Table A units, there would be no way of preventing the units from
arranging a future return to the non-Table A unit of any allowances surrendered by the non-Table A unit to the Table
A unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final regulation, if the non-Table A unit fails to comply with the maximum emissions rate during the year,
the Table A unit owners and operators must surrender a number of allowances equal to the non-Table A unit's baseline
multiplied by the difference between the actual emissions rate for the year and the maximum emissions rate. This approach
segregates out the effect of utilization changes and leaves such changes to be handled under the reduced utilization
and allowance surrender provisions (e.g., &sect;&sect;72.43, 72.91, and 72.92) applicable to all Phase I units.
The surrendered allowances must have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances allocated to the
non-Table A unit for the year, and the surrender must be made on or before the allowance transfer deadline. In order
to encourage early reductions at non-Table A units and innovative approaches to achieving such reductions, the surrender
and deduction of allowances will be the only remedy under the Act for failure to meet the maximum emissions rate. Of
course, the deduction of allowances for failure to achieve the maximum emissions rate may result in a unit having insufficient
allowances to cover its annual emissions, and the full panoply of remedies for excess emissions will then apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, in order to facilitate the Table A unit owners' and operators' exercise of control and the Agency's review
and enforcement, where necessary, of the substitution plan, the units involved should have a common designated representative.
A commenter supported the need for a common designated representative for this type of substitution plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The final regulation provides that the requirement to have a common designated representative is not met by simply
having a common alternate designated representative. This is because, as explained in the preamble of the November
18, 1993 proposed rule, an alternate designated representative does not carry the same level of responsibilities
as, and thus is not equivalent to, a designated representative. 58 FR 60958.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenter also suggested that the non-Table A owners and operators be required to submit quarterly and annual
reports to the Table A unit owners and operators and to indemnify such owners and operators for any violations at the
non-Table A unit. These requirements are not in the final rule because the Agency believes that these matters are not
central to the issue of control and are better left to the owners and operators of the two units.

C. Plan Termination if Control Requirement is no Longer met
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The January 11, 1993 regulations provide that where, as a result of ownership or other changes, the units in a substitution
plan no longer meet the common owner or operator requirement in those regulations, the substitution plan must be terminated.
The final regulation adopted here takes a similar approach. If there are changes that result in the control requirement
no longer being met, the designated representative must terminate the plan, whether the plan is based on common owners
or operators or on a contract. The Administrator may, on his or her own motion, terminate the plan under such circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The only exception to this requirement is for substitution plans approved, and included in final permits issued,
under the January 11, 1993 regulations and the Partial Settlement in

continue to meet the common owner, operator, or designated representative requirement in the January 11, 1993 regulations,
such plans will not be terminated for the first year (and, in some cases, for the second year) for which the substitution
unit received a total number of allowances equal to the number provided in those regulations. This exception is consistent

, requires each Federal agency to consider potential impacts of its regulations on small business ``entities.''
Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), an agency issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking must prepare and make available for public
comment a regulatory flexibility analysis. Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that
a rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).

In the preamble of the January 11, 1993 regulations, the Administrator certified that those regulations, including
the provisions revised by today's final rule, would not have a significant impact. 58 FR 3649. The final rule revisions
adopted today are not significant enough to change the economic impact addressed in the preamble of the January 11,
1993 regulations, which were certified as not having a significant impact. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C.

(5) A demonstration that the substitution plan meets the requirement that each unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this
section is under the control of the owner or operator of each unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section that designates
the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section as a substitution unit. The demonstration shall be one of the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage
ownership interest of 50 percent or more in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or the units
have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their aggregate percentage ownership
interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section or identifying the units' common operator.
The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section has one or more owners or operators that have an aggregate percentage
ownership interest of at least 10 percent and less than 50 percent in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2)
of this section and the units do not have a common operator, a statement identifying such owners or operators and their
aggregate percentage ownership interest in the capacity of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this seciton and stating
that each such owner or operator has the contractual right to direct the dispatch of the electricity that, because
of its ownership interest, it has the right to receive from the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The fact
that the electricity that such owner or operator has the right to receive is centrally dispatched through a power pool
will not be the basis for determining that the owner or operator does not have the contractual right to direct the dispatch
of such electricity. The designated representative shall submit supporting documentation upon request by the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A copy of an agreement that is binding on the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section
and the owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, provides each of the following elements,
and is supported by documentation meeting the requirements of paragraph (c)(6) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The owners and operators of the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must not allow the unit to emit sulfur
dioxide in excess of a maximum annual average SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate (in lbs/mmBtu), specified in the agreement, for each year during the period that the substitution
plan is in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The maximum annual average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate for the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed 70 percent of the lesser of: the
unit's 1985 actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation for the unit for four consecutive quarters that immediately precede the 30-day period ending
on the date the substitution plan is submitted to the Administrator. If the unit is covered by a non-unit-specific
federally enforceable or State enforceable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation in the four consecutive quarters or, as of November 15, 1990, in Phase I, the Administrator will
determine, on a case-by-case basis, how to apply the non-unit-specific emissions limitation for purposes of determining
whether the maximum annual average SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate meets the requirement of the prior sentence. If a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation is not different from a non-unit-specific federally enforceable SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions limitation that was effective and applicable to the unit in 1985, the Administrator will apply the non-unit-specific
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions rate, the designated representative of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must surrender
allowances for deduction from the Allowance Tracking System account of the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
The designated representative shall surrender allowances authorizing emissions equal to the baseline of the unit
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section multiplied by the difference between the actual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

of the exceedance, and the surrendered allowances shall have the same or an earlier compliance use date as the allowances
allocated to the unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for that year. The designated representative may identify
the serial numbers of the allowances to be deducted. In the absence of such identification, allowances will be deducted
on a first-in, first-out basis under &sect;73.35(c)(2) of this chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The unit under paragraph (a)(2) of this section and the unit under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall designate
a common designated representative during the period that the substitution plan is in effect. Having a common alternate
designated representative shall not satisfy the requirement in the prior sentence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

description will not be implemented during Phase I unless the unit remains a substitution unit. The permit revision
will be treated as an administrative amendment, except where the Administrator determines that the change in the
description alters the fundamental nature of the actions to be taken and that public notice and comment will contribute
to the decision-making process, in which case the permit revision will be treated as a permit modification or, at the
option of the designated representative, a fast-track modification.

), an endangered species, into Yellowstone National Park, which is located in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. These
wolves will be classified as nonessential experimental wolves according to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species
Act of 1973 (Act), as amended. Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the Western United States. They
presently occur in a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences in Idaho, Wyoming,
and Washington due to wolves dispersing from populations in Montana and Canada. This reintroduction plan is to reestablish
a viable wolf population in the Yellowstone area, one of three wolf recovery areas identified in the Northern Rocky
Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this final rule were evaluated in an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction does not conflict with existing or anticipated Federal
agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness areas, or surrounding lands.

1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legal: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific animals as ``experimental.''
Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was permitted to reintroduce
a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic range for conservation and recovery purposes. However,
local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions
on Federal and private activities contained in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroduction as
a management tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(j), a listed species reintroduced outside of its current range, but within its historic range, may
be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.'' This designation
increases the Service's flexibility and discretion in managing reintroduced endangered species because such experimental
animals may be treated as a threatened species. The Act requires that animals used to form an experimental population
be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional management flexibility is possible if the experimental animals are found to be ``nonessential'' to the
continued existence of the species in question. Nonessential experimental animals located outside national wildlife
refuges or national park lands are treated for purposes of section 7 of the Act, as if they were only proposed for listing.
Consequently, only two provisions of section 7 would apply to animals located outside of national wildlife refuges
and national parks_section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4). Section 7(a)(1) requires all Federal agencies to establish
conservation programs for the particular species. Utilization of Federal public lands, including national parks
and national forests, is consistent with the legal responsibility of these agencies to sustain the native wildlife
resources of the United States and to use their authorities to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation
programs for endangered and threatened species. Section 7(a)(4) requires all Federal agencies to informally confer
with the Service on actions that will likely jeopardize the continued existence of the proposed to be listed as threatened
or endangered species. The results of a conference are advisory in nature, and agencies are not required to refrain
from committing resources to projects as a result of a conference. In addition, section 10(j) of the Act states that
nonessential experimental animals are not subject to the formal consultation of the Act unless they occur on land
designated as a national wildlife refuge or national park. Activities undertaken on private lands are not affected
by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specimens used to establish an experimental population may be removed from a source or donor population, provided
their removal is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species, and appropriate permits have been
issued in accordance with 50 CFR 17.22. Gray wolves for the reintroduction will be obtained from healthy Canadian
wolf populations with permission from the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western
Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000). No adverse biological impact is expected from the removal of
about 150 wolves from the Canadian population. Consequently, the Service finds that wolves to be used in the reintroduction
effort meet the definition of ``non-essential'' (50 CFR 17.80(b)) because the loss of the reintroduced wolves is
not likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival of the species in the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1967, the timber wolf was listed as a subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus lycaon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered (32 FR 4001), and in 1973 the northern Rocky Mountain subspecies, as then understood, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was also listed as endangered, as was the Texas subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. monstrabilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (38 FR 14678). In 1978, the legal status of the gray wolf in North America was clarified by listing the Minnesota wolf
population as threatened and other members of the species south of Canada were listed as endangered, without referring
to subspecies (43 FR 9607). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Biological: This final rule deals with the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species of carnivore that was extirpated from the western portion of the conterminous United States
by about 1930. The gray wolf is native to most of North America north of Mexico City, except for the southeastern United
States, where a similar species, the red wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), is found. The gray wolf occupied nearly every area in North America that supported populations of hoofed mammals
(ungulates), its major food source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-four distinct subspecies of gray wolf had been recognized in North America. Recently, however, taxonomists
have suggested that there are five or fewer subspecies or group types of gray wolf in North America and that the wolf
type that once occupied the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States was more widely distributed than was previously
believed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The gray wolf occurred historically in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. The drastic reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly
related to human activities, such as the elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural
lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. The natural history of wolves
and their ecological role was poorly understood during the period of their eradication in the conterminous United
States. As with other large predators, wolves were considered a nuisance and threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's
role as an important and necessary part of natural ecosystems is better understood and appreciated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 50 years prior to 1986, no detection of wolf reproduction was found in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States.
However in 1986, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This find was presumably
due to the southern expansion of the Canadian wolf population. The Glacier National Park wolf population has steadily
grown to about 65 wolves and now exists throughout northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or Wyoming. Wolves have occasionally been sighted in
these States, but do not constitute a population as defined by scientific experts (Service 1994). Historical reports
suggest that wolves may have produced young in these States; however, based on extensive surveys and interagency
monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population presently persists in these States.

Wolf Recovery Efforts: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1970's, the State of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a
recovery plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf. The 1980 recovery plan recommended a combination of natural
recovery and reintroduction be used to recover wolves in the area around Yellowstone National Park (the Park) north
to the Canadian border, including central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population
as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana,
central Idaho, and Yellowstone). A population of this size would be comprised of about 300 wolves. The plan recommended
natural recovery in Montana and Idaho. If two wolf packs did not become established in central Idaho within 5 years,
the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered. The plan recommended
use of the Act's section 10(j) authority to reintroduce experimental wolves in the Park. By establishing a nonessential
experimental population, more liberal management practices may be implemented to address potential negative impacts
or concerns regarding the reintroduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;512), Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of three
Federal, three State, and four interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration in the Park
and central Idaho. That committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991.
Among the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves in the Park, and
possibly central Idaho, as special nonessential experimental populations with flexible management practices
by agencies and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates would be intensively managed by the
States with Federal funding; thus, implementation was expected to be costly. Congress took no action on the committee's
recommendation which would have required an amendment to the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. Team participants were the National Park Service;
Forest Service; the States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana; USDA Animal Damage Control; and Wind River and Nez Perce
Tribes. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, the news media and nearly
2,500 groups/individuals interested in wolves were contacted to publicize the EIS process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as 7 other
locations throughout the United States. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people, and thousands of brochures
were distributed. In total, nearly 4,000 people gave comments on EIS issues. In July 1992, a report narrating the public
comments was mailed to 16,000 people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1992, 27 additional ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 additional hearings were held in Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. Hearings were also held in Seattle, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Washington, D.C. Two
major newspapers with circulation in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000) distributed
a copy of the alternative scoping brochure in the Sunday edition. Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings, and nearly
5,000 comments were received on methods for managing reintroduced wolves. Public comments typified the strong polarization
of concerns regarding wolf management. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information on wolves, and requested the public to report wolf observations in the northern
Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 interested individuals residing in all 50 States and over 40 foreign
countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
on July 16. The DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, interested groups,
and anyone who requested a copy. Additionally, a flyer containing the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 public hearings,
and a request to report wolf sightings was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers (combined circulation
of about 280,000) in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. In mid-June 1993, the Service mailed a letter to over 300 groups,
primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. This resulted in 31 presentations
to about 1,000 people during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the DEIS public review period (July 1 to November 26, 1993) over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government
agencies commented. The magnitude of the response shows the strong interest people have in wolf management. In early
March 1994, a summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and the notice of availability was
published on May 9, 1994. The EIS considered five alternatives: (1) Reintroduction of Wolves Designated as Experimental,
(2) Natural Recovery (No action), (3) No Wolves, (4) Wolf Management Committee Recommendations, and (5) Reintroduction
of Wolves Designated as Nonexperimental. After careful review, the Service's proposed action was to reintroduce
nonessential experimental gray wolves in the Park and central Idaho.

The Secretary signed the EIS Record of Decision on June 15, 1994. A letter of concurrence was signed by the Secretary
of Agriculture on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the Service to implement its proposed action plan as soon as
practical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Two nonessential experimental population proposed rules, one for the Park and one for central Idaho, were published

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively). On September 6, 1994, a brochure containing the Record
of Decision, proposed rules, and schedule of public hearings was mailed to about 50,000 people. From September 14&hyph;22,
1994, a legal notice announcing the proposed rules, hearings, and inviting public comment was published in the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning
Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. The availability of the Record of Decision, public hearings,
and proposed rules was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comments on the proposed rules were accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Montana, the Service has an active wolf management program due to the presence of breeding pairs of wolves. The Service's
program monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research, provides the public with accurate information,
and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolves that depredate on livestock are translocated or removed.
Such action is required to reduce livestock losses, to foster local tolerance, and promote and enhance conservation
of wolves. The relocation of wolves under the control program is not intended to accelerate the natural expansion
of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Although 19 wolves have been removed under the control program, the number
of wolves has continued to expand in Montana at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reintroduction Site:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service decided to reintroduce wolves into the Park because of the following factors. The Park is under Federal
jurisdiction, it has high-quality wolf habitat and good potential wolf release sites. It is also far from the natural
southern expansion of wolf packs from Montana. Thus, any wolf pack documented inside the Yellowstone experimental
population area would probably be from reintroduction efforts rather than from naturally dispersing extant wolf
populations in Canada or northwestern Montana. The Service will also reintroduce wolves into central Idaho as a nonessential
experimental population published under a separate rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service determined that reintroduction of wolves into the Park had the highest probability to succeed due to ecological
and political considerations (Service 1994). The reintroduction effort will enhance wolf viability by increasing
genetic diversity through genetic interchange between segments of the population. The reintroduction plan for
the Park should help in achieving wolf recovery goals 20 years sooner than under current natural recovery policy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because reintroduced gray wolves will be classified as a nonessential experimental population, the Service's management
practices can reduce local concerns about excessive government regulation of private lands, uncontrolled livestock
depredations, excessive big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of gray wolves in the Park will initiate wolf recovery in one of the three recovery areas described as
necessary for the species recovery in the northern Rocky Mountains. No existing or anticipated Federal or State actions
identified for this release site are expected to have major effects on the experimental population. Central Idaho
is identified as the only other alternative site, and it will also receive wolves for reintroduction which will facilitate
recovery in that experimental area.

Reintroduction Protocol: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the National Park Service, Forest
Service, other Federal agencies, potentially affected tribes, the States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, and entities
of the Canadian government. To obtain wolves, the Service will enter into formal agreements with the Canadian and
Provincial governments and/or resource management agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Park's wolf reintroduction plan requires transferring 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern Canada, representing
various sex and age classes, over a 3- to 5-year period. The capture of about 15 wild wolves from several different packs
using standard capture techniques will be done annually over 3 to 5 years. Captured wolves will be transported to the
Park. Wolves from the same pack will be placed in individual holding pens of about 0.4 hectare (1 acre) for up to 2 months
for acclimation to the new environment. The acclimation pens will be isolated to protect the wolves from other animals
and to prevent habituation to humans. During the acclimation period but after release, each wolf will be monitored
by radiotelemetry to ensure quick retrieval, if necessary. Carcasses of natural prey taken in the Park will be provided
to the wolves. Veterinary care, including examinations and vaccinations, will be provided as needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once acclimated, the wolves will be released into the Park. Food (ungulate carcasses) will be provided until the wolves
no longer use it. Initially, all wolves will be closely monitored with a gradual reduction over time. Previous experiences
with reintroduced wolves have shown that they may not remain together. In general, attempts to locate and/or move
lone wolves dispersing throughout the Park will not be done. However, wolves may be moved on a case-by-case basis,
if necessary, to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental area. Reintroduced wolves will remain in the wild, as long
as they are capable of sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Conflicts between wolves and humans may result
in the recapture and/or removal of a wolf in accordance with procedures successfully used with other problem wolves.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction will be made after the first year and for every year thereafter.
Procedures for subsequent releases could be modified, if information from the previous reintroduction warrants
such changes. The physical reintroduction phase should be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. Once the reintroduced
wolves form two packs with each pack raising two pups, for 2 consecutive years, management practices would allow the
wolves to grow naturally toward recovery levels. Wolves would only be monitored, and no further reintroduction would
take place unless fewer than two litters were produced in a single year. This reintroduction effort is consistent
with the recovery goals identified in the 1987 recovery plan for the northern Rocky Mountain Gray Wolf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that the Park's reintroduction effort with a similar effort in central Idaho, plus the natural recovery
occurring in northwestern Montana, could result in a viable recovered wolf population (10 breeding pairs in each
of 3 recovery areas for 3 consecutive years) by the year 2002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will continue to ask private landowners and agency personnel adjacent to the Park to immediately report
any wolf observations to the Service or other authorized agencies. An extensive information and education program
will discourage the taking of gray wolves by the public. Initially, all wolves will be monitored by radio telemetry
and, therefore, easy to locate if necessary. Public cooperation with the Service will be encouraged to ensure close
monitoring of the wolves and quick resolution of any conflicts that might arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific information on wolf reintroduction procedures can be found in Appendix 4 ``Scientific techniques for the
reintroduction of wild wolves'' in the environmental impact statement: ``The Reintroduction of Gray Wolves to Yellowstone
National Park and Central Idaho'' (Service 1994).

In accordance with section 10(j) of the Act, wolves reintroduced into the Park are designated as nonessential experimental.
Such designation allows the wolves to be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing for the purposes
of sections 4(d), 7, and 9 of the Act. This allows the Service to establish a less restrictive special rule rather than
using the mandatory prohibitions covering endangered species. The biological status of the wolf and the need for
management flexibility resulted in the Service designating gray wolves reintroduced into the Park as ``nonessential.''
The Service determined that the ``nonessential'' designation, with other protective measures, will conserve and
recover the gray wolf in the Yellowstone ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that released wolves will come into contact with humans and domestic animals inside and outside
of the Park. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning, and the positions taken by elected
local, State, and Federal government officials indicate that wolves should not be reintroduced without assurances
that current uses of public and private lands will not be disrupted by wolf recovery activities. The following provisions
respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional, nonnegligent, and accidental
taking of wolves by the public, provided the take was incidental to otherwise lawful activities, it did not result
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care or was in defense of human life. Such wolf takings would need to
be reported to the Service or other authorized agency within 24 hours. The Service may designate certain Federal,
State, and/or tribal employees to take wolves that required special care or pose a threat to livestock or property.
Private land owners or their designates would be permitted to harass wolves in an opportunistic noninjurious manner
on their leases or private property, provided such harassment was reported within 7 days to the Service or other authorized
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the ``nonessential'' status, private landowners or their designates would be permitted to take (injure or
kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However, physical evidence (wounded or dead
livestock) of such an attack would be required to document that the attack occurred simultaneously with the taking.
A report of such a take would need to be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or other authorized agency
personnel for investigation. Once six or more breeding pairs are established in the Park or experimental area, livestock
owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves
that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments. Such a take would be only permitted
after due notification to Service-designated agencies and unsuccessful capture efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves that repeatedly (two times in a calendar year) attack domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine,
goats, etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private land would be designated as problem wolves and relocated from the area
by the Service or a designated agency. After one relocation, wolves that continued to depredate on domestic animals
would be considered chronic problem wolves and would be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations would be primary cause for failure of the States or tribes
to meet their specific big game management objectives outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges.
The Service could, however, determine that wolves responsible for excessive depredation should be translocated
to other sites in the experimental area. Such actions are expected to be rare and unlikely to impact the overall recovery
rate. States and tribes would need to define such situations in their Service-approved wolf management plans before
such actions could be taken. Under the nonessential designation, wolves could not be deliberately killed solely
to resolve predation conflicts with big game. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho and potentially affected tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative
agreements for management of the gray wolf outside of national parks and national wildlife refuges. These cooperative
agreements would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and tribes have adequate regulatory
authority to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. The National Park Service will be the primary agency
implementing the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of national parks. States and tribes are anticipated
to be the primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside of national parks and national
wildlife refuges after their wolf management plans are approved by the Service. The Service will provide oversight,
coordinate wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and tribes do not assume wolf
management responsibilities or adhere to provisions of their wolf management plans, the Service would assume management
authority. If for unforeseen reasons the wolf population failed to sustain positive growth toward recovery levels
for 2 consecutive years, the influencing factors would be identified. The Service, and affected States or tribes
would be responsible for determining if any management strategies needed modification. The Service in coordination
with the States and tribes would implement those strategies to ensure wolf population recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that protective measures and management practices are necessary and advisable for the conservation
and recovery of the gray wolf and that no additional Federal regulations are required. The Service also finds that
the nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves taken from wild populations and released in
the Park. The nonessential status for such wolves allows for additional management flexibility. Nonessential experimental
populations located outside of a national park or national wildlife refuge are treated under the Act as if they were
only proposed for listing, and not listed. Only section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4) apply to Federal actions outside
national parks and wildlife refuges. Presently, there are no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated
management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal agencies in the areas. The national forests are beneficial
to the reintroduction effort in that they form a natural buffer to private properties and are typically managed to
produce wild animals that wolves could prey upon. The Service finds the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated
with the nonessential designation do not pose a threat to the recovery effort and continued existence of the gray wolf.

The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a national park or national wildlife
refuge. Consequently, the Service, National Park Service, Forest Service, or any other Federal agency is prohibited
from authorizing, funding, or carrying out an action within a national park or national wildlife refuge that is likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations must
consider all experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a listed species for analysis purposes in national parks.
The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of the parks and refuges and determined that none are likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf, nor will they adversely affect the success of the reintroduction
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands. However, there are some risks to wolf
recovery associated with take of wolves in regard to other land uses and various recreational activities. Potential
threats are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities, and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting, trapping,
and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or strictly regulated in national parks, as well as closely
regulated by State and Federal law and policy. There are very few paved or unpaved roads in the proposed reintroduction
area or immediately outside of it. The unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic, are constructed for low speeds
and used only seasonally. Thus, wolves should encounter vehicles infrequently. In accordance with existing labeling,
the use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves is prohibited. Overall, the possible risks and threats
that could impact the success of the reintroduction effort are thought to be minimal.

The release site for reintroducing wolves will be in Yellowstone National Park. The designated experimental population
area will include the State of Wyoming; that portion of Idaho east of Interstate Highway 15; and the State of Montana
east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River east of Great Falls, Montana, to the Montana/North Dakota
border.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To date, the experimental population area does not currently support any reproducing pairs of wolves. It is also unlikely
that wolves from the natural southern expansion from northwestern Montana have arrived in the Park. Except for the
gray wolves in northwestern Montana, only an occasional, isolated wolf has been reported, killed, or otherwise documented
in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, or other Western States. Single packs have been reported throughout the northern Rocky
Mountains. However, these reported wolves or groups of wolves, if factual, apparently disappeared for unknown reasons
and did not establish recoverable ``populations'' as defined by wolf experts. A wolf population is defined as at least
two breeding pairs of gray wolves that each successfully raise at least two young to December 31 of their birth year
for 2 consecutive years (Service 1994). Thus, the Service has determined that there is no population of wolves in the
Park and therefore, the Park reintroduction is consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act; specifically,
that experimental wolves need to be geographically separate from other nonexperimental populations. It is possible
that prior to 2002, other wolves may appear in the wild and be attracted to the experimental area occupied by the reintroduced
wolves. Any ``new'' arrivals would be classified as part of the experimental population. These wolves could assist
in the recovery and expansion of the experimental population to where wolves could be dispersing into central Idaho
and Montana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves dispersing into areas in Idaho and Montana, outside of the experimental area, would continue to receive endangered
species protection under the Act, as did the wolves that recolonized an area near Glacier National Park in 1982. It
is also possible, but not probable, that during the next 3 years wolves could move between recovery areas and enhance
the genetic diversity between natural recovery areas and reintroduction sites. It is not anticipated that such exchange
will significantly alter the recovery rate in the Park's experimental population area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Service determined that there is no existing wolf population in the recovery area that would preclude
reintroduction and establishment of an experimental population in the Park, the Service will continue to determine
the presence of any wild wolves. Prior to any reintroduction, the Service would evaluate the status of any wolves found
in the experimental population area. If a wolf population is discovered in the proposed experimental area, no reintroduction
of wolves would occur. Instead, the success of the naturally occurring wolf population would be monitored to determine
if recovery was continuing. If a natural wolf population is located in the experimental area prior to the effective
date of the final rule, then the final rule would not be implemented and there would be no reintroduction program. Wolves
naturally occurring would be endangered and managed as such, with full protection under the Act. If the natural wolf
population failed to maintain positive growth for two consecutive years, then the reintroduction effort could proceed
or other recovery measures taken. After reintroduction is completed, according to the Reintroduction Protocol
(section 5 above), management of the experimental population will begin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once this rule is effective and wolves have been released into the recovery area, the rule would remain in effect until
wolf recovery occurs or a scientific review indicates that modifications in the experimental rule are necessary
to achieve wolf recovery.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a wolf population is discovered in the Park's recovery area, after the effective date of the experimental population
rule but before release, reintroduction under the rule would not occur in that area and any such wolves would be managed
as a natural recovering population. Boundaries of the proposed experimental population area would be changed, as
needed, to encourage recovery of the naturally occurring, breeding wolf population. No experimental population
area will contain a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that have successfully raised young,
prior to the establishment of the experimental area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the nonessential experimental wolf population would allow reintroduced wolves to be killed or moved
by Service authorized Federal, State, and tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation
on big game populations. Under special conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle,
sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private
funding sources would be encouraged. When six or more wolf packs are documented in the experimental population area
outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges, there would be no land-use restrictions, including
areas around den sites or other critical areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate. Projected recruitment would off-set the anticipated 10 percent
mortality resulting from management control actions. An additional 10 percent loss could occur from other mortality
sources. Once reintroduced wolves reach the goal of six wolf packs, the reproductive output of the packs would provide
a population increase at or near 22 percent per year. Closely regulated public control (taking of depredating wolves)
would effectively focus on only individual problem wolves. Agency control actions would more likely target groups
of wolves containing problem individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and States or tribes as authorized, could move wolves that are negatively impacting ungulate populations.
Such wolves would be moved to other places within the experimental population area. Two examples when this would occur
are (1) when wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability because of unusual habitat or weather conditions
(e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat) and (2) when wolves cause prey to move onto private property
and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal management plans which
are to be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such control actions are conducted. Wolves
will not be deliberately killed solely to address ungulate-wolf conflicts. Control actions by the States or tribes
likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the experimental rule as determined by the Service would have
to be specifically incorporated into an amendment of this experimental rule and subject to national public comment
and review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of wolves in the experimental population would not cause major changes to existing private or public land-use
restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after six breeding pairs of wolves are established
in this experimental area. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in the experimental area, land-use restrictions
could be used, as needed, to control intrusive human disturbance on public lands. Their implementation would be at
the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies. Before five or fewer breeding wolf pairs are established,
temporary restrictions on human access near active wolf den sites may be required between April 1 and June 30. Any restrictions
on private land would only occur with complete landowner cooperation and concurrence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service, and Federal, State, or tribal agencies, after they have been authorized by the Service, could promptly
remove any wolf from the experimental population once the Service, or its authorized agencies, has determined it
was presenting a threat to human life or safety. Although not a management option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it is noted that a person can legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental,
unavoidable, unintentional, accidental take in the course of otherwise lawful activity, or in defense of human life,
would be permitted by the Service and its authorized agencies, provided that such taking was not resulting from negligent
conduct lacking reasonable due care, due care was exercised to avoid taking a wolf, and the taking was immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the appropriate authorities. Shooters have the responsibility to identify their target
before shooting. The act of taking a wolf that is wrongly identified as another species, for purposes of this rule,
will be considered as intentional, negligent, and not accidental. Such take may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and other Federal, State, or tribal agencies, after they have been designated by the Service, may control
wolves that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or
moving wolves when five or fewer breeding pairs are established, or by other previously described measures. Killing
wolves or placing them in captivity may only be considered when there are six or more breeding pairs established in
the experimental population area. When depredation occurs on public land and prior to the establishment of six breeding
pairs, depredating females and their pups would be captured and released, at or near the site of capture, one time prior
to October 1. If depredations continue, or if six packs are present, females and their pups would be removed. Wolves
on private land under these same circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals or pets on
private land twice in a calendar year would be moved, and chronic problem wolves would be removed from the wild.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, other Federal agencies, and State or tribal wildlife personnel would be authorized and trained to take
wolves under special circumstances. Wolves could be live-captured and translocated to resolve conflicts with State
or tribal big-game management objectives, when they are located outside of the experimental areas, or to enhance
wolf recovery. If the captured animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, it could be placed in a captive facility.
Killing of any wolves would be a last resort and only authorized when live capture attempts fail or there is some clear
danger to human life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and authorized agencies of the Service would use the following conditions and criteria to determine the
status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Wounded livestock or the partial remains of a livestock carcass must be presented with clear evidence (Roy and
Dorrance 1976; Fritts 1982) that the livestock injury or death was directly caused by a wolf or wolves. Such evidence
is essential for justifying any control action because wolves may feed on carrion they did not kill. Additionally,
there must be an indication that additional livestock losses may occur if the problem wolf or wolves are not controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves can be present. Improperly disposed livestock carcasses
located in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or a decision on the use
of such attractants must accompany any control action. If livestock carrion or carcasses are not being used as bait
for an authorized control action on Federal lands, it must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that they will not
attract wolves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal responsibility for protecting gray wolves under the experimental population provisions of the Act would
continue until formal delisting rulemaking procedures are completed. In accordance with the Act, delisting may
occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information shows that gray wolves are no longer
threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization, (3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy
of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors. In addition to the above, the following
criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years, a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery
areas described in the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and
(3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service 1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population
must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting, if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below
the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years, then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for
protective status under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
status and regulations revoked when (1) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered under the
Act or (2) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding pairs
that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental population
area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively) (Service 1994a). The Record of Decision, notification
of the proposed rules, and tentative schedule for public hearings were mailed to nearly 50,000 people on September
6, 1994. All interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to
the development of the final rule. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice announcing the proposed rules,
hearings, and inviting public comment were published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New
Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming
Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette beginning on September 14, 1994.

The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. A notification of the hearings and availability of the
Record of Decision and proposed rules was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comment on the proposed rules was accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 426 written and oral responses, representing 621 signatures, were received during the proposed rule 34-day
comment period. Several letters, including letters from the Governor of the State of Wyoming and the Colorado Wool
Growers Association, were received after comment period closed. However, these letters were reviewed and considered.
From October 17 to 24, 1994, a specialized interagency team analyzed the public comments. After October 31, 1994,
the team's report was distributed to agency cooperators and to anyone requesting it (Service 1994c). In addition
to the public comments, three Notices of Intent to Sue were received. The Service has completed its review and consideration
of all written and oral comments. All of the issues raised by the public on the proposed rules were previously identified
and addressed in the final EIS. Analysis of the comments revealed 25 issues which are identified and discussed below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Changes in final rule as a result of public comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following minor changes and clarifications were made to the final rule or to discussions of the final rule based
on public comments on the proposed rule. These individual or cumulative changes do not alter the predicted impact
or effect of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Several conditions on when wolves may be harassed or taken were removed from the final rule. The following conditions
are not part of the final rule: (1) Distinction between adult wolves and pups, and (2) harassment may only occur for
15 minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In the background discussion of the final rule, it was clarified that after a private individual takes a depredating
wolf, no additional agency actions will be conducted to control problem wolves in an area, unless more livestock depredations
occur. This assumes that the problem wolf was killed, and therefore, no other control actions are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Several terms in the final rule were clarified and defined, including: ``opportunistic noninjurious harassment,''
``unintentional take,'' ``disposal of livestock carrion,'' issuance criteria for a wolf take permit to a grazing
lessee on public lands, and criteria for resolving wolf/ungulate conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A termination clause was added to the final rule. The clause clarifies the Service's role and responsibilities
regarding the establishment of an experimental population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Three years following the initial reintroduction of wolves, a thorough review will be conducted. The review will
determine if further reintroductions are required and if, to date, the management program has been successful. A
provision to the rule was added that if the reintroduction and management practices under the experimental population
rule did not result in wolf recovery, the Service would take appropriate actions. Such actions would be caused by the
failure of the wolf population to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years. All corrective actions would
be coordinated with affected States, tribes, and other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Language regarding scientific or technical decisions in the background discussion of the rule was changed. Study
design and reintroduction techniques may be changed or modified when expert and skilled biologists determine such
changes are necessary and prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of relevant issues based on public comments and the Service's response to those issues follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subspecies of wolf that occupied the Yellowstone area was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reintroduction program will use wolves from Canada which were once classified as a different subspecies; therefore,
this violates the experimental population provision of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent times, there have been several revisions to the taxonomic classification of wolves in North America. Several
scientific investigations have dealt with this issue (Brewster and Fritts 1994, Nowak 1994, Wayne et al. 1994). These
investigations concluded (1) there were fewer wolf subspecies than previously believed, (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was not a distinct subspecies, and (3) that wolves might be better classified as types or representative groups of
geographic or climatic conditions rather than distinct subspecies. The northern Rocky Mountains are within the
historic range of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Investigators conclude that reintroduction of wolves from Canada to the Park or central Idaho would accelerate
the ongoing natural southern expansion of the species. Additionally, it was determined that current taxonomic discussions
of wolf subspecies should not affect wolf recovery efforts in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States.

Issue 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment to section 10(j) of the Act states that experimental populations may only be designated when there is
geographical separation between the experimental population and other existing populations of the species. The
occasional occurrence of lone wolves in the areas of central Idaho and Yellowstone would prohibit the use of the experimental
population designation since there would be no geographic separation between natural occurring and experimental
wolves. Comments also stated that the boundaries of the experimental areas should be adjusted or the reintroduction
program should be delayed, particularly, in central Idaho due to the presence of naturally occurring wolves.

For many years, the Service and other agencies have tried to document wolf activity in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming
(Service 1994a Appendix 12). Since the 1970's, wolf observations particularly from Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho,
have been reported. However, to date the only documented breeding groups of wolves are in northwestern Montana. Based
on scientific inquiry, the Service defines a wolf population as at least two breeding pairs of wild wolves each successfully
raising at least two young each year, for 2 consecutive years, and that a population is composed of breeding groups
of wolves (Service 1994a, Appendix 9). Presently, there are no known breeding pairs of wolves within the experimental
area. Nor does the experimental area contain any portions of home ranges of any breeding pairs of wolves. The Service
finds that there is no geographic overlap between any Montana wolf population home range and the experimental area.
The northern boundary of the Idaho experimental population area was moved further south because, in 1990 and 1992,
there were a few instances when an active breeding group of wolves from Montana were located south of the experimental
boundary recommended in the proposed rule. The rulemaking language now allows revocation of this rule and removal
of all reintroduced wolves, if within 90 days after the initial reintroduction a naturally occurring wolf population
is discovered in the experimental area. Any naturally occurring wolves will be managed as endangered species under
the Act and afforded the same terms and conditions as wolves in Montana. The Service has had a wolf monitoring program
in place in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming for over two years. This system is designed to accept reports from anyone, and
when a report focuses on a particular area a wolf biologist investigates to verify the presence or absence of wolves.
Through this method the Service has identified newly formed packs in northwestern Montana. Within the experimental
area, no confirmation of wolves from provided reports has occurred.

(Service 1994a). Professional wildlife biologists and scientific organizations complimented the Service on the

For the past 20 years and presently, the Service and others have searched for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains.
Reviews of correspondence from the past 25 years show the longstanding and widespread view that wolves already occupied
Idaho and the discovery of their presence imminent. Very extensive monitoring within the experimental population
area has not confirmed the presence of wolves. This particular species is not habitat limited and if allowed to get
into the experimental area would reproduce and survive. The translocation of wild wolves from Canada to the Park will
provide the opportunity to start a wolf population. This translocation effort will greatly facilitate recovery
of the gray wolf in the Yellowstone ecosystem. The 1987 Rocky Mountain wolf recovery plan recommended an additional
5 years of monitoring for natural wolf recovery in Idaho. However, the recovery plan provided other options if two
breeding pairs of wolves had not become established in Idaho during the 5 years. Because no breeding pairs have been
located, the draft and final EIS and Record of Decision allow the simultaneous reintroduction of wolves into central
Idaho and the Park in an effort to ensure the viability and conservation of wolves in the Rocky Mountains (Service 1994a,
Appendix 16).

The Service proposed a very liberal experimental rule to accommodate concerns of local residents and the affected

The Service believes that, as proposed, reintroduction and management techniques will result in wolf population
recovery and delisting by about 2002. Rulemaking language was added clarifying that take activities must lead to
eventual recovery of the wolf. Additionally, if there is no progress in achieving wolf population recovery (i.e.,
if wolves in a recovery area do not exhibit positive growth for 2 consecutive years), then factors impacting population
growth will be investigated. Information from the investigation will be made available to the public and appropriate
Federal, State, and tribal agencies. Within a year, the agencies may recommend and implement new management actions
or modifications to their wolf management plans to correct factors negatively impacting wolf recovery. Only as a
last resort would changes or modifications to sections of the experimental rule be made.

 The proposed rules' requirements that ``only adult wolves (greater than 50 pounds) can be harassed'' and then ``only
for 15 minutes'' and ``only adult wolves that are witnessed attacking livestock on private land can be killed by private
parties'' are overly restrictive. The provision that wolves can only be killed under a special permit when (1) seen
attacking livestock for the third time on Federal lands, (2) six or more wolf packs are present in the experimental
population, and (3) all agency control efforts have failed, does not address the issues in a timely or efficient manner.
The implication that land-use restrictions may be employed on private lands when five or fewer wolf packs are present
in the experimental area also needs clarification.

 The Service agrees and has eliminated (1) the distinction between adult wolves and pups for both noninjurious harassment
and take and (2) the length of time wolves may be harassed (as long as physical injury is not incurred). Permittees with
grazing rights on public land can readily obtain a written take permit for wolves seen attacking livestock. However,
issuance criteria still require that prior to issuing the 45-day take permit (1) six or more wolf packs must be present
in the experimental population area, (2) authorized agencies must confirm that a wolf caused the livestock injury
or death, and (3) other agency control actions have failed to resolve the problem. The final rule also clarifies that
no land-use restrictions will be exercised by Federal agencies on private land at any time.

 The Service added or clarified definitions and/or language in the final rule. However, the wolf reintroduction program
is complex and has many unforeseen variables. It is impossible to imagine or describe in detail every situation that
might arise during its implementation. Some situations can only be accurately addressed on a case-by-case basis
and judged by their particular circumstances. It is the intent of the Service to use the experimental rule to aid the
conservation, recovery, and eventual delisting of wolf populations in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United
States. The Service in cooperation with other Federal, State, and tribal agencies will use the flexibility of the
experimental rule to address local concerns and unforeseen situations. The professional expertise and experience
of wildlife managers will facilitate the implementation and any modifications needed to improve the wolf reintroduction
program. Additional language was added to the rule, clarifying that management flexibility is required as the program
is implemented and refined.

 To date, the Federal government has funded the participation of affected States and tribes in regard to wolf restoration
program. The Service plans to continue its funding commitment with Congressional appropriations until wolves are
delisted. The public stated its concern over the use of taxpayer dollars and the need for government to wisely spend
tax dollars. The Service, therefore, must keep expenses for wolf reintroduction as low as possible while maintaining
an effective program. The Service will encourage the States and tribes to submit reasonable budgets for wolf management
programs, as well as search for ways to pool and coordinate resources so that overall costs are reduced. It is the legal
responsibility of the Service to monitor the progress and adherence of State and tribal agencies to their management
plans. The Service will ensure and work cooperatively with others to meet the stated recovery goals.

 In Montana, the Defenders of Wildlife implemented a private livestock compensation program. Because the Defenders
Program has been successful, it was expanded to include Idaho and Wyoming. The Service will not directly fund a livestock
compensation program. The Service will encourage livestock producers to utilize private compensation programs
when depredation occurs. The Service and USDA Animal Damage Control will aid livestock producers by maintaining
an effective control program that minimizes livestock losses due to wolves. The rule addresses the concerns of private
property owners by (1) providing an effective control program, (2) allowing landowners to take wolves on their private
land when justified, and (3) invoking no land-use restrictions on private land. The Service has reviewed the constitutionality
of this rule in regard to protected private property rights. The review concludes the Service's actions do not violate
the private property rights of individuals (Service 1994a, Appendix 6).

 It is well documented that the Service made an extraordinary effort to involve the public and other government entities
in developing management practices and the experimental population rules regarding the wolf reintroduction program.
During the past 3 years, the Service held over 100 meetings, open houses, and hearings. The Service distributed over
750,000 documents and reviewed and considered nearly 170,000 public comments during development of the rule. Federal
agencies and affected States and tribes were active participants during the process. This final rule represents
the participatory work and consensus of affected agencies and others interested or impacted by the rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is confident in the States' and tribes' ability to evaluate the impact wolf predation may have on ungulate
populations and, when appropriate, implement corrective management actions. An evaluation of possible impacts
and/or actions in regard to a specific ungulate species and location is best accomplished by biologists most familiar
with the situation. The Service, States, and tribes will coordinate wolf management plans to ensure that State and
tribal interests in native ungulate management are met while meeting the Service's mandate for wolf recovery. Rulemaking
language was added to the section on how States and tribes will manage ungulate/wolf conflicts. States and tribes
are required to prepare acceptable management plans for approval by the Service. It is expected that since these management
plans may affect State wildlife management programs, the States will go through a public review process as part of
their development. Such plans will indicate the point at which wolf/ungulate conflicts become so critical that corrective
action must be taken. A decision to translocate wolves to reduce such conflicts must serve to enhance, or at a minimum
not inhibit, wolf recovery.

 The timeframes for a person to report the harassing (7 days) and/or the unintentional taking (24 hours) of wolves were
not changed. The harassing or taking of a wolf is a critical and potentially serious event. A person who harasses a wolf
is best served by reporting the incident as soon as possible so agency management actions can be implemented, if necessary.
Submission of a report on wolf harassment provides a record which can document the continuation of suspected or actual
livestock depredations or rationale for taking a wolf. The immediate reporting of livestock depredation by a wolf
also allows the immediate investigation of the incident and gathering of fresh evidence. In Montana, agency professionals
who investigate livestock depredations are readily accessible during the night, weekends, and holidays. During
the past 9 years in Montana, the reporting, documenting, and resolution of livestock depredations have not been significant
issues. Therefore, they are not anticipated to be a problem for wolf reintroductions into the experimental population
areas. The United States legal system often takes into account unusual mitigating circumstances, such as the remoteness
of a livestock allotment interfering with an individual being able to report an incident as required by regulation.
The Service could determine that an incident would not be referred for prosecution, when a person failed to meet the
reporting requirements and could justify their action.

 In accordance with the Act, delisting may occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information
shows that gray wolves are no longer threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization,
(3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors.
In addition to the above, the final EIS, states that the following criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years,
a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery areas described in the revised wolf recovery
plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and (3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service
1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting,
if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years,
then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for protective status under the Act. Delisting procedures have
been discussed (Service 1994a, Appendix 11). Endangered wolves in northwestern Montana can be downlisted to threatened
once 10 breeding pairs are documented for 3 consecutive years. Experimental populations of wolves cannot be downlisted
because their protective status is based on the experimental population rule. Experimental population rules can
be withdrawn when wolf numbers have reached recovery levels, no further protection under the Act is required, and
the wolf is delisted.

The Service prepared and published an intra-Service evaluation of its proposed action in the draft and final EIS (Service

would not adversely impact other endangered or threatened species. In November 1994, Service field offices in Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming reviewed the proposed rules and came to the same conclusion. The Service finds that the impact
of the final rules, like the predicated impact reviewed of the proposed rules, will not adversely affect other protected

The hybridization of wolves with other canids may occur; however, it is not a significant problem anywhere in North
America where ranges of wolves, domestic dogs, coyotes, and foxes overlap (Service 1994a, Chapter 1). Thus, it is
not anticipated to be a problem in the northern Rocky Mountains. The rules state the Service or other authorized agencies
may remove reintroduced wolves that breed with domestic dogs, coyotes, or foxes, or their hybrid-offspring. Individual
animals that agency biologists suspect to be domesticated wolves or wild wolf/other canid species hybrids would
be removed from the wild after examination of the canid's physical or behavioral characteristics.

It is documented that individual wolves may disperse over 500 miles. However, for the past 10 years, there has been
no evidence of naturally occurring wolves dispersing to and producing a viable wolf population in the central Idaho
or Yellowstone areas. After the effective date of the experimental population rules, any such wolves and their offspring
would be treated as experimental population animals. From a practical wildlife management perspective, the Service
cannot be expected to determine if an individual wolf had naturally dispersed into the area or been reintroduced.
The initial reintroduced animals will be radio collared and differentiated. Once they have reproduced it would be
impossible to determine if the wolf was a wild dispersing animal or progeny of experimental wolves. The rule as written
helps avoid the possible conflict. Such a distinction, therefore, cannot be treated separately by regulation. Undoubtedly,
the establishment of a viable wolf population and recovery of the species will be enhanced by the reintroduction of
30 wolves annually for the next 3&hyph;5 years. The presence of reintroduced wolves may increase the probability
of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada to move into, stay, and reproduce in an experimental
area. While this event would contribute to population recovery, it would not greatly impact the overall population
growth rate since the majority of breeding wolves would be reintroduced animals.

Wolves are adaptable to a wide variety of human activities, except for deliberate killing. Experiences in North America
indicate that human disturbance, even around active den sites, is not a significant factor affecting wolf survival
or population growth (Service 1994a, Appendix 13). The rule protects active wolf dens during the earliest stages
of wolf recovery, if necessary. Killing wolves is illegal except for a very few limited exceptions. The rule allows
flexibility to reconsider land use restrictions if wolf populations do not grow toward recovery levels. Wolves in
Montana have not needed land-use restrictions and, at this time, land-use restrictions do not appear necessary for
wolf populations to recover in Idaho or Wyoming.

The opportunity for private individuals to kill wolves in the experimental population areas is limited to when wolves
are actually in the act of killing livestock. The Service has determined that wolves that exhibit this behavior do
not further conservation of the species and for that reason are currently controlled (Service 1988). The selective
removal of this type of individual by the public is warranted in certain limited circumstances and their removal contributes
to conservation of the species. Agency control would be initiated anyway and, under tight regulation, public control
can be more likely to remove the specific problem individual than agency control actions. If a wolf is taken in the act
of depredating, further agency control would not be conducted unless additional depredations occur. This limited
taking of wolves by the private sector could reduce the total number of wolves that might be taken in response to livestock
depredations and reduces the opportunity for other wolves to feed on or learn to depredate on livestock.

As stated in the Service's EIS, in the proposed rule, and in the final rule, removal of wolves from Canadian populations
would not significantly impact those populations (59 FR 42110); the likelihood that wolf populations would become
permanently established and grow to recovery level is extremely high (59 FR 42111); reintroduction would greatly
accelerate wolf population recovery, enhance wolf population viability, and lead to subsequent delisting (59 FR
42110); and the reintroduced wolves and subsequent population that developed would not be affected by existing or
anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities within or adjacent to the experimental population area
(59 FR 42112), therefore, the release of the experimental wolves would further the conservation of the species (Service
1994a, Service 1994b).

The rule clarifies that while the States and Tribes are encouraged to lead implementation of the experimental rule,
the Service will monitor and is ultimately responsible for the recovery of the species. Should progress toward wolf
recovery not be evident (two years of no growth would trigger other conservation measures), the Service will cooperate
with the states and tribes to assure steps are taken to resume progress toward recovery. The states and tribes already
have highly professional wildlife management programs in place and their expertise, authorities, knowledge, and
organizations can greatly enhance recovery of the species. Animal Damage Control is a professional federal wildlife
management agency that has the responsibility, like all federal agencies, to use their authorities to enhance the
recovery of listed species. Animal Damage Control has been a valuable and necessary component of wolf recovery activities
in Montana and Minnesota.

The measure of success in the wolf recovery program is not the level of wolf population mortality but growth of the wolf
population. Wolf populations can withstand varying levels of mortality and individual wolf mortality is very difficult
to measure accurately. Language was added to the final rule that clarifies the need to modify the state and tribal plans,
which must be in compliance with the rule, if wolf population growth is not evident. Wolf population growth is easier
to accurately monitor and is the criteria that is used to implement other provisions in the rule (e.g. when lethal control
may be used, when a population is established, when reintroductions stop, and when wolf populations are recovered).
A ``put and take'' strategy does not address the problem of a wolf population failing to maintain growth and is an expensive
process to conduct. It is more productive to identify the factors preventing wolf population growth and correct them
before simply continually adding more wolves that may die from the same causes. A population that required constant
reintroductions to compensate for excessive mortality rates could not be delisted.

The Service determined the boundaries of the experimental populations based upon the distribution of the wolf population
in Montana. The experimental population boundaries do not include any portion of any known area used by breeding wolves
in Montana. It was also determined that any wolf population inside the experimental boundaries would most likely
be the result of reintroduced wolves and any breeding groups of wolves outside the experimental boundaries would
likely be the result of natural dispersal of wolves from northwestern Montana or Canadian populations. The definition
of a wolf population underwent scientific peer review (Service 1994a, Appendix 8). The rationale and location of
the experimental population boundaries were also reviewed, and no better consensus of a way to define the geographic
range of a wolf population was brought to the Service's attention.

Once a wolf population is established in an experimental area there is no need to conduct further reintroductions
and to do so would not be cost effective. The soonest the ``wolf population'' criteria could be met is in three years.
At that time about 45 wolves would have been reintroduced to each area, assuring substantial genetic diversity, and
10&hyph;20 pups should be born annually.

What does legally present livestock mean? Who is responsible for determining livestock husbandry practices?

Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions on legally present livestock are part of the rule so that control of problem wolves will occur only when
livestock are present on public land in a manner already allowed by conditions in their federal, state, or tribal grazing
permit. No new conditions are expected because of wolf reintroduction. Control of wolves that attack livestock should
not be expected when livestock are illegally present on federal lands. Proper livestock husbandry practices means
the current community standards and practices used by livestock producers as already determined by the land management
agency issuing the permit. No changes from the standard livestock grazing practices already being used on federal
grazing leases are envisioned. Wolf management in Montana has not affected livestock management practices on public
lands and would likely not affect those practices in other areas. Issues like proper disposal of livestock carrion
are already being addressed in the Yellowstone area because of other concerns such as grizzly bear recovery. Language
in the final rule reflects that carrion must be managed in such a way as not to present a continuing attractant to wolves
if problems occur, but leaves the livestock producer and land management agency to determine how best to address potential
problems.

 The Service has reviewed public concern about the accuracy of its early responses to issues raised in the draft and
final EIS and which were also raised by persons commenting on the proposed rule. At this time, the information provided
during the public comment period on the proposed rule does not provide sufficient data or cause for the Service to significantly
change any of its earlier findings which were published in the final EIS regarding the issues of: Amending the Endangered
Species Act, wolves as a missing component of the ecosystem, humane treatment of wolves, enjoying wolves, regulated
public take, cost of the program, state, tribal, and federal authority, viable population, travel corridors, range
requirements, control strategies, illegal killing, compensation, delisting, need for public education, spiritual
and cultural significance, social and cultural environment, recovery areas, ungulate populations, hunter harvest,
domestic livestock, land use, visitor use, economics, wolves not native to Yellowstone, wolf rights, federal subsides,
human health and safety, predators and scavengers, other endangered species, other plants, invertebrates, fish,
reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, diseases and parasites, private property rights, wolf recovery in other
areas, existing wolves in Idaho and Yellowstone, existing wolves in northwestern Montana, wolf subspecies, wolf/dog/coyote
hybridization, and the need for research (Service 1994a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Service adjusted the experimental population boundaries to exclude any portion of known wolf pack territories
in an effort to reduce the likelihood that any naturally dispersing breeding groups of wolves would fall under the
proposed experimental rule regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, and using the best scientific and commercial data available, in accordance with 50 CFR 17.81, the
Service finds that releasing wolves into Yellowstone National Park constitutes reintroduction into a high-priority
site and will further advance conservation and recovery of this species.

This rule was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no recordkeeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.

Due to biological requirements, the wolf reintroduction program needs to be conducted in November through February,
as recommended by wolf scientists during the EIS process. The nonessential experimental population rule has been
extensively debated and thoroughly investigated during development of the EIS and draft rules. Because of the extensive
public review of the EIS, Record of Decision, and proposed rules, all being similar to this final rule, implementation
of the wolf reintroduction program should start as of the date of publication, without a 30-day waiting period. Therefore,
for good cause and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Service has determined that the rule should become effective
immediately upon filing for public inspection.

(i) Gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gray wolves identified in paragraph (i)(7) of this section are nonessential experimental. These wolves will
be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Service finds that reintroduction of nonessential experimental gray wolves, as defined in (i)(7), will further
the conservation of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental population area except as provided in paragraphs
(i) (3), (7), and (8) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are legally using public land
(Federal land and any other public lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service)
may harass any wolf in an opportunistic (the wolf cannot be purposely attracted, tracked, waited for, or searched
out, then harassed) and noninjurious (no temporary or permanent physical damage may result) manner at any time, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such harassment is non-lethal or is not physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported within 7 days to the
Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take (including to kill or injure) a wolf in the act of killing,
wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and tribal wolf management
plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such incidents are to be immediately reported within 24 hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction
or agency representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less than 24 hours) wounded (torn flesh
and bleeding) or killed by wolves must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies will confirm if livestock
were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing allotments on public land may receive a written
permit, valid for up to 45 days, from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, to take (including to
kill or injure) a wolf that is in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that six or more breeding pairs of wolves have been documented in the experimental population area and the Service
or other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the livestock losses were caused by wolves and have
completed agency efforts to resolve the problem. Such take must be reported immediately within 24 hours to the Service
project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service. There must be evidence
of freshly wounded or killed livestock by wolves. Service or other agencies, authorized by the Service, will investigate
and determine if the livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be
referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potentially affected States and tribes may capture and translocate wolves to other areas within an experimental
population area as described in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the level of wolf predation is negatively impacting localized ungulate populations at an unacceptable level. Such
translocations cannot inhibit wolf population recovery. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal wolf management plans.
These plans must be approved by the Service before such movement of wolves may be conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service, may promptly remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the
Service or agency authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self defense or in defense of others, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that such take is reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project leader or Service
designated agent. The taking of a wolf without an immediate and direct threat to human life may be referred to the appropriate
authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take wolves that are determined to be ``problem'' wolves.
Problem wolves are defined as: wolves that in a calendar year attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules)
or as defined by State and tribal wolf management plans approved by the Service, or wolves that twice in a calendar year
attack domestic animals (all domestic animals other than livestock). Authorized take includes, but is not limited
to non-lethal measures such as: aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or translocating wolves. Such taking
may be implemented when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in a experimental population area. If the take
results in a wolf mortality, then evidence that the mortality was nondeliberate, nonnegligent, accidental, and
unavoidable must be provided. When six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area,
lethal control of problem wolves or permanent placement in captivity will be authorized but only after other methods
to resolve livestock depredations have been exhausted. Depredations occurring on Federal lands or other public
lands identified in State or tribal wolf management plans and prior to six breeding pairs becoming established in
an experimental population area, may result in capture and release of the female wolf with pups, and her pups at or near
the site of capture prior to October 1. All wolves on private land, including female wolves with pups, may be relocated
or moved to other areas within the experimental population area if continued depredation occurs. Wolves attacking
domestic animals other than livestock, including pets on private land, two or more times in a calendar year will be
relocated. All chronic problem wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being moved once for previous
domestic animal depredations) will be removed from the wild (killed or placed in captivity). The following three
criteria will be used in determining the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population
area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) There must be evidence of wounded livestock or partial remains of a livestock carcass that clearly shows that the
injury or death was caused by wolves. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on carrion which they found and
did not kill. There must be reason to believe that additional livestock losses would occur if no control action is taken.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses
in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or carcasses on public land, not being
used as bait under an agency authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that it will not
attract wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking
is to be reported within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform with such
provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may receive written authorization from the Service to take
animals under special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts
with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the designated
experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release to a remote
area, or placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will
be a last resort and is only authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear endangerment to human
life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental
population area, pursuant to terms of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing
for such purposes by the Service when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf from the wild within the
experimental population area, if such action is for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Scientific purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and tribal land management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply
to public lands or other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. When six or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of national
parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population
recovery levels for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal agencies would identify, recommend,
and implement corrective management actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use restrictions
to promote growth of the wolf population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in paragraph (i) of this
section or in violation of applicable State or tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense
defined in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) [Reserved] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The Yellowstone Management Area is shown on the following map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental
population area will be that portion of Idaho that is east of Interstate Highway 15; that portion of Montana that is
east of Interstate Highway 15 and south of the Missouri River from Great Falls, Montana, to the eastern Montana border;
and all of Wyoming.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (i)(7) after the first releases will be considered
nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental area
(as defined in paragraph (i)(7) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in Minnesota)
unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination and
genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any of the
following courses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area, it may be relocated, placed in captivity, or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service-approved
plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not likely to be a wild gray wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service
determine the animal shows physical or behavioral evidence of hybridization with other canids, such as domestic
dogs or coyotes, or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be kept in captivity or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The reintroduced wolves will be monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio telemetry
and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases and parasites
prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that is sick, injured,
or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service-designated
agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction area
as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity or
euthanize it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 3 years, after the first year of
releases of wolves, to determine future management needs and if further reintroductions are required. This review
will take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as
well as the overall health and fate of the experimental wolves. Once recovery goals are met for downlisting or delisting
the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does
not foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray
wolf is recovered and delisted in the northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act. However,
if the wolf population does not demonstrate positive growth toward recovery goals for 2 consecutive years, the affected
States and tribes, in cooperation with the Service, would, within 1 year, identify and initiate wolf management strategies,
including appropriate public review and comment, to ensure continued wolf population growth toward recovery levels.
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
status and regulations revoked when (i) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered under the
Act or (ii) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding pairs
that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental population
area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) will reintroduce the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species, into central Idaho, including a portion of southwestern Montana. These wolves will be classified
as a nonessential experimental population pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended
(Act). Gray wolf populations have been extirpated from most of the Western United States. They presently occur in
a small population in extreme northwestern Montana, and as incidental occurrences in Idaho, Wyoming, and Washington
as a result of wolves dispersing from existing populations in Montana and Canada. The purpose of this reintroduction
plan is to reestablish a viable wolf population in central Idaho, one of three wolf recovery areas identified in the
Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan. Potential effects of this final rule were evaluated in an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) completed in May 1994. This gray wolf reintroduction does not conflict with existing or anticipated
Federal agency actions or traditional public uses of park lands, wilderness areas, or surrounding lands.

The Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1982, Pub. L. 97&hyph;304, made significant changes to the Endangered Species
Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Act), including the creation of section 10(j), which provides for the designation of specific animals as ``experimental.''
Under previous authorities in the Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) was permitted to reintroduce
a listed species into unoccupied portions of its historic range for conservation and recovery purposes. However,
local opposition to reintroduction efforts from certain parties concerned about potential restrictions, and prohibitions
on Federal and private activities contained in sections 7 and 9 of the Act, reduced the utility of reintroduction as
a management tool. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(j), a listed species reintroduced outside of its current range, but within its historic range, may
be designated, at the discretion of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary), as ``experimental.'' This designation
increases the Service's flexibility and discretion in managing reintroduced endangered species because such experimental
animals may be treated as a threatened species. The Act requires that animals used to form an experimental population
be separated geographically from nonexperimental populations of the same species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional management flexibility is possible if the experimental animals are found to be ``nonessential'' to the
continued existence of the species in question. Nonessential experimental animals located outside national parks
or national wildlife refuges are treated, for purposes of section 7 of the Act, as if they were only proposed for listing.
Consequently, only two provisions of section 7 would apply to animals located outside of national wildlife refuges
and national parks_section 7(a)(1) and section 7(a)(4). Section 7(a)(1) requires all Federal agencies to establish
conservation programs for federally listed species. Utilization of Federal public lands, including national parks
and national forests, is consistent with the legal responsibility of these agencies to sustain the native wildlife
resources of the United States and to use their authorities to further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation
programs for endangered and threatened species. Section 7(a)(4) requires all Federal agencies to informally confer
with the Service on actions that will likely jeopardize the continued existence of species proposed to be listed as
threatened or endangered. The results of a conference are advisory in nature, and agencies are not required to refrain
from committing resources to projects as a result of a conference. In addition, section 10(j) of the Act states that
nonessential experimental animals are not subject to the formal consultation provision of the Act unless they occur
on land designated as a national wildlife refuge or national park. Activities undertaken on private lands are not
affected by section 7 of the Act unless they are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specimens used to establish an experimental population may be removed from a source or donor population, provided
their removal is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species and appropriate permits have been
issued in accordance with 50 CFR 17.22. Gray wolves for the reintroduction will be obtained from healthy Canadian
wolf populations with permission from the Canadian and Provincial governments. Gray wolves are common in western
Canada (tens of thousands) and Alaska (about 7,000). No adverse biological impact is expected from the removal of
about 150 from the Canadian population. Consequently, the Service finds that wolves to be used in the reintroduction
effort meet the definition of ``nonessential'' (50 CFR 17.80(b)) because the loss of the reintroduced wolves is not
likely to appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival of the species in the wild.

In 1967, the timber wolf was listed as a subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus lycaon
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered (32 FR 4001), and in 1973 the northern Rocky Mountain subspecies, as then understood, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was also listed as endangered, as was the Texas subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. l. monstrabilis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (38 FR 14678). In 1978, the legal status of the gray wolf in North America was clarified by listing the Minnesota wolf
population as threatened and other members of the species south of Canada as endangered, without referring to subspecies
(43 FR 9607).

This final rule deals with the gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an endangered species of carnivore that was extirpated from the western portion of the conterminous United States
by about 1930. The gray wolf is native to most of North America north of Mexico City, except for the southeastern United
States, where a similar species, the red wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), was present. The gray wolf occupied nearly every area in North America that supported populations of hoofed mammals
(ungulates), its major food source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-four distinct subspecies of gray wolf had been recognized in North America. Recently, however, taxonomists
have suggested that there are five or fewer subspecies or group types of gray wolf in North America and that the wolf
type that once occupied the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States was more widely distributed than was previously
believed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The gray wolf occurred historically in the northern Rocky Mountains, including mountainous portions of Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. The drastic reduction in the distribution and abundance of this species in North America was directly
related to human activities, such as the elimination of native ungulates, conversion of wildland into agricultural
lands, and extensive predator control efforts by private, State, and Federal agencies. The natural history of wolves
and their ecological role was poorly understood during the period of their eradication in the conterminous United
States. As with other large predators, wolves were considered a nuisance and threat to humans. Today, the gray wolf's
role as an important and necessary part of natural ecosystems is better understood and appreciated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 50 years prior to 1986, no detection of wolf reproduction was found in the Rocky Mountain portion of the United States.
However in 1986, a wolf den was discovered near the Canadian border in Glacier National Park. This find was presumably
due to the southern expansion of the Canadian wolf population. The Glacier National Park wolf population has steadily
grown to about 65 wolves and now exists throughout northwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reproducing wolf populations are not known to occur in Idaho or southwestern Montana. Wolves have occasionally been
sighted in these States, but do not constitute a population as defined by scientific experts (Service 1994). Historical
reports suggest that wolves may have produced young in these States; however, based on extensive surveys and interagency
monitoring efforts (Service 1994), no wolf population presently persists in these States.

Wolf Recovery Efforts: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 1970's, the State of Montana led an interagency recovery team, established by the Service, that developed a
recovery plan for the Northern Rocky Mountain gray wolf. The 1980 recovery plan recommended a combination of natural
recovery and reintroduction be used to recover wolves in the area around Yellowstone National Park (the Park) north
to the Canadian border, including central Idaho. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A revised recovery plan was approved by the Service in 1987 (Service 1987). It identified a recovered wolf population
as being at least 10 breeding pairs of wolves, for 3 consecutive years, in each of 3 recovery areas (northwestern Montana,
central Idaho, and Yellowstone). A population of this size would be comprised of about 300 wolves. The plan recommended
natural recovery in Montana and Idaho. However, if two wolf packs did not become established in central Idaho within
5 years, the plan recommended that conservation measures other than natural recovery be considered. The plan recommended
use of the Act's section 10(j) authority to reintroduce wolves into the Park and central Idaho. By establishing a nonessential
experimental population, more liberal management practices may be implemented to address potential negative impacts
or concerns regarding the reintroduction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, Congress directed appointment of a Wolf Management Committee, composed of three Federal, three State, and
four interest group representatives, to develop a plan for wolf restoration in the Park and central Idaho (Pub. L.
101&hyph;512). That committee provided a majority, but not unanimous, recommendation to Congress in May 1991. Among
the measures recommended was a declaration by Congress directing reintroduction of wolves in the Park, and possibly
central Idaho, as special nonessential experimental populations with flexible management practices by agencies
and the public to resolve potential conflicts. Wolves and ungulates would be intensively managed by the States with
Federal funding; thus, implementation was expected to be costly. Congress took no action on the committee's recommendation
which would have required an amendment to the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1991 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;154), Congress directed the Service, in consultation with the National Park Service
and Forest Service, to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to consider a broad range of alternatives
on wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. In 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;381), Congress
directed the Service to complete the EIS by January 1994 and indicated the preferred alternative should be consistent
with existing law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service formed and funded an interagency team to prepare the EIS. The team participants were the National Park
Service; Forest Service; States of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana; USDA Animal Damage Control; and Wind River and Nez
Perce Tribes. The Gray Wolf EIS program emphasized public participation. In the spring of 1992, the news media and
nearly 2,500 groups/individuals interested in wolves were contacted to publicize the EIS process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1992, a series of 27 ``issue scoping'' open houses were held in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho, as well as 7 other
locations throughout the United States. The meetings were attended by nearly 1,800 people, and thousands of brochures
were distributed. In total, nearly 4,000 people gave comments on EIS issues. In July 1992, a report narrating the public
comments was mailed to 16,000 people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1992, 27 additional ``alternative scoping'' open houses and 3 additional hearings were held in Wyoming,
Montana, and Idaho. Hearings were also held in Seattle, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Washington, DC. Two
major newspapers with circulation in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho (total circulation about 250,000) distributed
a copy of the alternative scoping brochure in the Sunday edition. Nearly 2,000 people attended the meetings, and nearly
5,000 comments were received on methods for managing reintroduced wolves. Public comments typified the strong polarization
of concerns regarding wolf management. A report on the public's ideas and suggestions was mailed to about 30,000 people
in November 1992. In April 1993, a Gray Wolf EIS planning update report was published. It discussed the status of the
EIS, provided factual information on wolves, and requested the public to report wolf observations in the northern
Rocky Mountains. It was mailed to nearly 40,000 interested individuals residing in all 50 States and over 40 foreign
countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comment period on the draft EIS (DEIS) began on July 1, 1993, and the notice of availability was published
on July 16. The DEIS documents were mailed to potentially affected agencies, public libraries, interested groups,
and anyone who requested a copy. Additionally, a flyer containing the DEIS summary, a schedule of the 16 public hearings,
and a request to report wolf sightings was inserted into the Sunday edition of 6 newspapers (combined circulation
of about 280,000) in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. In mid-June 1993, the Service mailed a letter to over 300 groups,
primarily in Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho, offering a presentation on the DEIS. This resulted in 31 presentations
to about 1,000 people during the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the DEIS public review period (July 1 to November 26, 1993) over 160,200 individuals, organizations, and government
agencies commented. The magnitude of the response shows the strong interest people have in wolf management. In early
March 1994, a summary of the public comments was mailed to about 42,000 people on the EIS mailing list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final EIS was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on May 4, 1994, and the notice of availability was
published on May 9, 1994. The EIS considered five alternatives (1) Reintroduction of Experimental Wolves (2) Natural
Recovery (No action), (3) No Wolves, (4) Wolf Management Committee Recommendations, and (5) Reintroduction of Nonexperimental
Wolves. After careful review, the Service's proposed action was to reintroduce gray wolves designated as nonessential
experimental into the Park and central Idaho.

The Secretary signed the EIS Record of Decision on June 15, 1994. A letter of concurrence was signed by the Secretary

practical.

of Decision, proposed rules, and schedule of public hearings was mailed to about 50,000 people. From September 14&hyph;22,
1994, a legal notice announcing the proposed rules, hearings, and inviting public comment was published in the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, DC; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comments on the proposed rules were accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Montana, the Service has an active wolf management program due to the presence of breeding pairs of wolves. The Service's
program monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research, provides the public with accurate information,
and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolves that depredate on livestock are translocated or removed.
Such action is required to reduce livestock losses, to foster local tolerance, and promote and enhance conservation
of wolves. The relocation of wolves under the control program is not intended to accelerate the natural expansion
of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Although 19 wolves have been removed under the control program, the number
of wolves has continued to expand in Montana at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reintroduction Site: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service decided to reintroduce wolves into central Idaho on or near Federal lands managed by the USDA Forest Service.
The Idaho location was selected as a site for experimental wolves because of the following factors. The central Idaho
site is a vast area of about 53,000 km2 (20,000 mi2) of contiguous National forests, including the Bitteroot, Boise,
Challis, Clearwater, Nez Perce, Payette, Sawtooth, Salmon, and Panhandle National Forests. The central area is
comprised of three wilderness areas: the Frank Church River-of-no-Return, Selway Bitteroot, and Gospel-Hump.
These wilderness areas have about 16,000 km2 (6,000 mi2) of quality wolf habitat and several good potential release
sites. The area is also far from the natural southern expansion of wolf packs from Montana. Thus, any wolves documented
inside the central Idaho experimental area would probably be from reintroduction efforts rather than naturally
dispersing extant wolf populations from Canada or northwestern Montana. The Service will also reintroduce wolves
into Yellowstone National Park as a nonessential experimental population published under a separate rule in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service determined that reintroduction of wolves into central Idaho had the highest probability to succeed due
to ecological and political considerations (Service 1994). The reintroduction effort will enhance wolf viability
by increasing genetic diversity through genetic interchange between segments of the population. The reintroduction
plan should help in achieving wolf recovery goals 20 years sooner than under current natural recovery policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because reintroduced gray wolves will be classified as a nonessential experimental population, the Service's management
practices can reduce local concerns about excessive government regulation on private lands, uncontrolled livestock
depredations, excessive big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishment of gray wolves in central Idaho will initiate wolf recovery in one of the three recovery areas described
as necessary for the species' recovery in the northern Rocky Mountains. No existing or anticipated Federal or State
actions identified for this release site are expected to have major effects on the experimental population. Yellowstone
National Park is identified as the only other alternative site; it will also receive wolves for reintroduction, which
will facilitate recovery in that experimental area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reintroduction Protocol: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The wolf reintroduction project is undertaken by the Service in cooperation with the National Park Service, Forest
Service, other Federal agencies, potentially affected tribes, the States of Idaho and Montana, and entities of the
Canadian government. To obtain wolves, the Service will enter into formal agreements with the Canadian and Provincial
governments and/or resource management agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central Idaho reintroduction plan requires transferring 45 to 75 wolves from southwestern Canada, representing
various sex and age classes, over a 3- to 5-year period. Under the plan, about 15 wild wolves from several different
packs using standard capture techniques will be captured annually over a period of 3 to 5 years. Captured wolves will
be transported to central Idaho. The wolves will receive any necessary veterinary care, including examinations
and vaccinations. They will be fitted with radio collars so that they can be monitored by radiotelemetry. The wolves
will be immediately released into the wild. This method is known as ``quick release,'' (i.e., the wolves will be released
upon or shortly after transport and arrival at the release site). ``Quick release'' wolves will not be held for acclimation
nor will food or care be provided after release. It is anticipated that released wolves will move widely but eventually
will find mates and form packs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, attempts to locate and/or move lone wolves dispersing throughout central Idaho will not be done. However,
wolves may be moved on a case-by-case basis, if necessary to enhance wolf recovery in the experimental area. Reintroduced
wolves will remain in the wild, as long as they are capable of sustaining themselves on carrion or wild prey. Conflicts
between wolves and humans may result in the recapture and/or removal of a wolf in accordance with procedures successfully
used with other problem wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An overall assessment of the success of the reintroduction will be made after the first year and for every year thereafter.
Procedures for subsequent releases could be modified, if information from the previous reintroduction warrants
such changes. The physical reintroduction phase should be completed within 3&hyph;5 years. Once the reintroduced
wolves form two packs with each pack raising two pups, for 2 consecutive years, management practices would allow the
wolves to grow naturally toward recovery levels. Wolves would only be monitored, and no further reintroduction would
take place unless fewer than two litters were produced in a single year. This reintroduction effort is consistent
with the recovery goals identified in the 1987 recovery plan for the northern Rocky Mountain Wolf. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is estimated that the central Idaho reintroduction effort, together with a similar effort in the Park and the natural
recovery occurring in northwestern Montana, could result in a viable recovered wolf population (10 breeding pairs
in each of 3 recovery areas for 3 consecutive years) by the year 2002. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service will continue to ask private landowners and agency personnel in or around central Idaho to immediately
report any wolf observations to the Service or other authorized agencies. An extensive information and education
program will discourage the taking of gray wolves by the public. Initially, all wolves will be monitored by radio telemetry
and, therefore, easy to locate if necessary. Public cooperation with the Service will be encouraged to ensure close
monitoring of the wolves and quick resolution of any conflicts that might arise.

Specific information on wolf reintroduction procedures can be found in Appendix 4, ``Scientific techniques for

Status of Reintroduced Populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 10(j) of the Act, wolves reintroduced into central Idaho are designated as a nonessential
experimental. Such designation allows the wolves to be treated as a threatened species or species proposed for listing
for the purposes of sections 4(d), 7, and 9 of the Act. This allows the Service to establish a less restrictive special
rule rather than using the mandatory prohibitions covering endangered species. The biological status of the wolf
and the need for management flexibility resulted in the Service designating the gray wolves reintroduced into central
Idaho as ``nonessential.'' The Service determined that the ``nonessential'' designation, together with other
protective measures, will conserve and recover the gray wolf in central Idaho and southwestern Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that released wolves will come into contact with humans and domestic animals inside and outside
the central Idaho experimental population area. Public opinion surveys, public comments on wolf management planning,
and the positions taken by elected local, State, and Federal government officials indicate that wolves should not
be reintroduced without assurances that current uses of public and private lands will not be disrupted by wolf recovery
activities. The following provisions respond to these concerns. There would be no violation of the Act for unintentional,
nonnegligent, and accidental taking of wolves by the public, provided the take was incidental to otherwise lawful
activities, did not result from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care or was in defense of human life. Such
wolf takings would need to be reported to the Service or other authorized agency within 24 hours. The Service may designate
certain Federal, State, and/or tribal employees to take wolves that required special care or pose a threat to livestock
or property. Private land owners or their designates would be permitted to harass wolves in an opportunistic noninjurious
manner on their leases or private property, provided such harassment was reported within 7 days to the Service or other
authorized agency.

Under the ``nonessential'' designation, private landowners or their designates would be permitted to take (injure
or kill) a wolf in the act of wounding or killing livestock on private land. However, physical evidence (wounded or
dead livestock) of such an attack would be required to document that the attack occurred simultaneously with the taking.
A report of such a take would need to be immediately (within 24 hours) reported to the Service or other authorized agency
for investigation. Once six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area, livestock
owners or their designates could receive a permit from a Service-designated agency to take (injure or kill) gray wolves
that are attacking livestock on permitted public livestock grazing allotments. Such a take would be permitted only
after due notification to Service designated agencies and unsuccessful capture efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves that repeatedly (two times in a calendar year) attacked domestic animals other than livestock (fowl, swine,
goats, etc.) or pets (dogs or cats) on private land would be designated as problem wolves and relocated from the area
by the Service or a designated agency. After one relocation, wolves that continued to depredate on domestic animals
would be considered chronic problem wolves and would be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that wolf predation on big game populations would be a primary cause for failure of the States or tribes
to meet their specific big game management objectives outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges.
The Service could, however, determine that wolves responsible for excessive depredation should be translocated
to other sites in the experimental area. Such actions are expected to be rare and unlikely to impact the overall recovery
rate. States and tribes would need to define such situations in their Service-approved wolf management plans before
such actions could be taken. Under the nonessential designation, wolves could not be deliberately killed solely
to resolve predation conflicts with big game. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States of Montana and Idaho and potentially affected tribes will be encouraged to enter into cooperative agreements
for management of the gray wolf outside of national parks and national wildlife refuges. These cooperative agreements
would be reviewed annually by the Service to ensure that the States and tribes have adequate regulatory authority
to conserve listed species, including the gray wolf. The National Park Service will be the primary agency implementing
the experimental population rule inside the boundaries of national parks, while the States and tribes will be the
primary agencies implementing this experimental population rule outside national parks and national wildlife
refuges after their wolf management plans are approved by the Service. The Service will provide oversight, coordinate
wolf recovery activities, and provide technical assistance. If the States and tribes do not assume wolf management
responsibilities or adhere to provisions of their wolf management plans, the Service would assume management authority.
If for unforeseen reasons the wolf population failed to sustain positive growth toward recovery levels for 2 consecutive
years, the influencing factors would be identified. The Service and affected States and tribes would be responsible
for determining if any management strategies need modification. The Service in coordination with the States and
tribes would implement those strategies to ensure wolf population recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that protective measures and management practices under this rulemaking are necessary and advisable
for the conservation and recovery of the gray wolf and that no additional Federal regulations are required. The Service
also finds that the nonessential experimental status is appropriate for gray wolves taken from wild populations
and released into central Idaho. The nonessential status for such wolves allows for additional management flexibility.
Nonessential experimental populations located outside of a national park or national wildlife refuge are treated
for purposes of section 7 of the Act as if they were only proposed for listing, and not listed. Only section 7(a)(l) and
section 7(a)(4) apply to Federal actions outside national parks and national wildlife refuges. Presently, there
are no conflicts envisioned with any current or anticipated management actions of the Forest Service or other Federal
agencies in the area. The national forests are beneficial to the reintroduction effort in that they form a natural
buffer to private properties and are typically managed to produce wild animals that wolves could prey upon. The Service
finds that the less restrictive section 7 requirements associated with the nonessential designation do not pose
a threat to the recovery effort and continued existence of the gray wolf.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The full provisions of section 7 apply to nonessential experimental populations in a national park or national wildlife
refuge. Consequently, the Service, National Park Service, Forest Service, or any other Federal agency is prohibited
from authorizing, funding, or carrying out an action within a national park or national wildlife refuge that is likely
to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf. Pursuant to 50 CFR 17.83(b), section 7 determinations must
consider all experimental and nonexperimental wolves as a listed species for analysis purposes in national parks
and wildlife refuges. The Service has reviewed all ongoing and proposed uses of the parks and refuges and determined
that none are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the gray wolf, nor will they adversely affect the success
of the reintroduction program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the reintroduction area is remote and sparsely inhabited wild lands. However, there are some risks to wolf
recovery associated with take of wolves in regard to other land uses and various recreational activities. Potential
threats are hunting, trapping, animal damage control activities, and high speed vehicular traffic. Hunting, trapping,
and USDA Animal Damage Control programs are prohibited or strictly regulated in national parks, as well as closely
regulated by State and Federal law and policy. There are very few paved or unpaved roads in the proposed reintroduction
area or immediately outside of it. The unpaved roads typically have low vehicle traffic, are constructed for low speeds
and used only seasonally. Thus, wolves should encounter vehicles infrequently. In accordance with existing labeling,
the use of toxicants lethal to wolves in areas occupied by wolves is prohibited. Overall, the possible risks and threats
that could impact the success of the reintroduction effort are thought to be minimal.

Location of Experimental Population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The release site for reintroducing wolves into central Idaho will be on or near National Forest lands. The experimental
population area includes that portion of Idaho west of Interstate 15 and south of Interstate 90, and that part of Montana
south of Interstate 90, Highway 93 and 12 near Missoula, Montana, and west of Interstate 15.

Management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The experimental population area currently does not support any reproducing pairs of wolves. It is also unlikely
that wolves from the natural southern expansion from northwestern Montana have arrived in central Idaho. Except
for the gray wolves in northwestern Montana, only an occasional, isolated wolf has been reported, killed, or otherwise
documented in Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, or other Western States. Single packs have been reported throughout the northern
Rocky Mountains. However, these reported wolves or groups of wolves, if factual, apparently disappeared for unknown
reasons and did not establish recoverable ``populations'' as defined by wolf experts. A wolf population is defined
as at least two breeding pairs of gray wolves that each successfully raise at least two young to December 31 of their
birth year for 2 consecutive years (Service 1994). Thus, the Service has determined that the central Idaho reintroduction
is consistent with provisions of section 10(j) of the Act; specifically, that experimental wolves must be geographically
separate from other nonexperimental populations. It is possible that prior to 2002, other wolves may appear in the
wild and be attracted to the experimental population area by the reintroduced wolves or by other factors. Any ``new''
arrivals would be classified as part of the experimental population. Such wolves could assist in the recovery and
expansion of the experimental population to the point where wolves could disperse into other parts of Idaho and Montana.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves dispersing into areas in Idaho or Montana outside of the experimental area, would receive all the protections
of an endangered species under the Act, as did the wolves that recolonized an area near Glacier National Park in 1982.
It is possible, but not probable, that during the next 3 years wolves could move between recovery areas and enhance
the genetic diversity between natural recovery areas and reintroduction sites. However, it is not anticipated that
such exchange will significantly alter the recovery rate in the experimental population area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Service determined that there is no existing wolf population in the recovery area that would preclude
reintroduction and establishment of an experimental population in Idaho, the Service will continue to monitor for
the presence of any wild wolves. Prior to any reintroduction, the Service would evaluate the status of any wolves found
in the experimental population area. If a wolf population is discovered in the proposed experimental area, no reintroduction
of wolves would occur. Instead, the success of the naturally occurring wolf population would be monitored to determine
if recovery was continuing. If a natural wolf population is located in the experimental area prior to the effective
date of the final rule, then the final rule would not be implemented and there would be no reintroduction program. Wolves
naturally occurring would be classified as endangered and managed with full protection under the Act. If the natural
wolf population failed to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years, then the reintroduction effort could
proceed or other recovery measures could be taken. After reintroduction is completed, according to the Reintroduction
Protocol (section 5 above), management of the experimental population will begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the rule is in effect and wolves have been released into the recovery area, the rule would remain in effect until
wolf recovery occurs or a scientific review indicates that modifications in the experimental rule are necessary
to achieve wolf recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a wolf population is discovered in the central Idaho experimental population area after the effective date of the
experimental population rule but before release, reintroduction under the rule would not occur in that area and any
such wolves would be managed as a natural recovering population. Boundaries of the proposed experimental population
area would be changed, as needed, to encourage recovery of the naturally occurring, breeding wolf population. No
experimental population area would contain a portion of the home range of any active breeding pairs of wolves that
have successfully raised young, prior to the establishment of the experimental population areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the nonessential experimental population would allow reintroduced wolves to be killed or moved by
Service-authorized Federal, State, and tribal agencies for domestic animal depredations and excessive predation
on big game populations. Under special conditions, the public could harass or kill wolves attacking livestock (cattle,
sheep, horses, and mules). There would be no Federal compensation program, but compensation from existing private
funding sources would be encouraged. When six or more wolf packs are documented in the experimental population area
outside of the national parks and national wildlife refuges, there would be no land-use restrictions, including
areas around den sites or other critical areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wolves have a relatively high reproductive rate. Projected recruitment would off-set the anticipated 10 percent
mortality resulting from management control actions. An additional 10 percent loss could occur from other mortality
sources. Once reintroduced wolves reach the goal of six wolf packs, the reproductive output of the packs would provide
a population increase at or near 22 percent per year. Closely regulated public control (taking of depredating wolves)
would effectively focus on only individual problem wolves. Agency control actions would more likely target groups
of wolves containing problem individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and States or tribes as authorized, could move wolves that are negatively impacting ungulate populations.
Such wolves would be moved to other places within the experimental population area. Two examples when this would occur
are: (1) when wolf predation is dramatically affecting prey availability because of unusual habitat or weather conditions
(e.g., bighorn sheep in areas with marginal escape habitat); and (2) when wolves cause prey to move onto private property
and mix with livestock, increasing potential conflicts. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal management plans which
are to be approved by the Service through cooperative agreement before such control actions are conducted. Wolves
will not be deliberately killed solely to address ungulate-wolf conflicts. Control actions by the States or tribes
likely to be significant or beyond the provisions of the experimental rule as determined by the Service would have
to be specifically incorporated into an amendment of this experimental rule and subject to national public comment
and review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Management of wolves in the experimental population would not cause major changes to existing private or public land-use
restrictions (except at containment facilities during reintroduction) after six breeding pairs of wolves are established
in this experimental population area. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in the experimental population area,
land-use restrictions could be used as needed, and at the discretion of land management and natural resources agencies
to control intrusive human disturbance on public lands. Their implementation would be at the discretion of land management
and natural resource agencies. Before five or fewer breeding wolf pairs are established, temporary restrictions
on human access near active wolf den sites may be required between April 1 and June 30. Any restrictions on private land
would only occur with complete landowner cooperation and concurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and Federal, State, or tribal agencies authorized by the Service, could promptly remove any wolf from
the experimental population once the Service, or its authorized agencies, has determined it was presenting a threat
to human life or safety. Although not a management option 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is noted that a person could legally kill or injure wolves in response to an immediate threat to human life. The incidental,
unavoidable, unintentional, and accidental take in the course of otherwise lawful activity, or in defense of human
life, would be permitted by the Service and its authorized agencies, provided that such taking was not resulting from
negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, due care was exercised to avoid taking a wolf, and the taking was immediately
(within 24 hours) reported to the appropriate authorities. Shooters have the responsibility to identify their target
before shooting. The act of taking a wolf that is wrongly identified as another species, for purposes of this rule,
will be considered as intentional, negligent, and not accidental. Such a take may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, and other Federal, State, or tribal agencies after they have been designated by the Service, may control
wolves that attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) by aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or
moving wolves when five or fewer breeding pairs are established, or by other previously described measures. Killing
wolves or placing them in captivity may only be considered when there are six or more breeding pairs established in
the experimental population area. When depredation occurs on public land and prior to the establishment of six breeding
pairs, depredating females and their pups would be captured and released at or near the site of capture, one time prior
to October 1. If depredations continue, or if six packs are present, females and their pups would be removed. Wolves
on private land under these same circumstances would be moved. Wolves that attack other domestic animals or pets on
private land, twice in a calendar year would be moved, and chronic problem wolves would be removed from the wild. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service, other Federal agencies, and State or tribal wildlife personnel would be authorized and trained to take
wolves under special circumstances. Wolves could be live-captured and translocated to resolve conflicts with State
or tribal big-game management objectives, when they are located outside of the experimental areas, or to enhance
wolf recovery. If the captured animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild, it could be placed in a captive facility.
Killing of any wolves would be a last resort and only authorized when live capture attempts fail or there is some clear
danger to human life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and authorized agencies of the Service would use the following conditions and criteria to determine the
status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Wounded livestock or the partial remains of a livestock carcass must be presented with clear evidence (Roy and
Dorrance 1976; Fritts 1982) that the livestock injury or death was directly caused by a wolf or wolves. Such evidence
is essential for justifying any control action because wolves may feed on carrion they did not kill. Additionally,
there must be an indication that additional livestock losses may occur if the problem wolf or wolves are not controlled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) No evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves can be present. Improperly disposed livestock carcasses
located in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. On Federal lands, removal or a decision on the use
of such attractants must accompany any control action. If livestock carrion or carcasses are not being used as bait
for an authorized control action on Federal lands, it must be removed or otherwise disposed of so that they do not attract
wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On Federal lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal responsibility for protecting gray wolves under the experimental population provisions of the Act would
continue until formal delisting rulemaking procedures are completed. In accordance with the Act, delisting may
occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information shows that gray wolves are no longer
threatened with extinction due to: (1) loss of habitat, (2) overutilization, (3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy
of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors. In addition to the above, the following
criteria must be met: (1) for 3 consecutive years, a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery
areas described in the revised wolf recovery plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and
(3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service 1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population
must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting, if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below
the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years, then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for
protective status under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
population status and regulations revoked when (1) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered
under the Act or (2) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding
pairs that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental
population area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

Two proposed nonessential experimental population rules for the areas of Yellowstone National Park and central
Idaho were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively) (Service 1994a). The Record of Decision, notification
of the proposed rules, and tentative schedule for public hearings were mailed to nearly 50,000 people on September
6, 1994. All interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or information that might contribute to
the development of the final rule. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations,
and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice announcing the proposed rules,
hearings, and inviting public comment were published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New
Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming
Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette beginning on September 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. A notification of the hearings and availability of the
Record of Decision and proposed rules was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public
hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana; and on September
29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, DC; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings
and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comment on the proposed rules was accepted until October 17, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of 426 written and oral responses, representing 621 signatures, were received during the proposed rule 34-day
comment period. Several letters, including letters from the Governor of the State of Wyoming and the Colorado Wool
Growers Association, were received after comment period closed. However, these letters were reviewed and considered.
From October 17 to 24, 1994, a specialized interagency team analyzed the public comments. After October 31, 1994,
the team's report was distributed to agency cooperators and to anyone requesting it (Service 1994c). In addition
to the public comments, three Notices of Intent to Sue were received. The Service has completed its review and consideration
of all written and oral comments. All of the issues raised by the public on the proposed rules were previously identified
and addressed in the final EIS: The Reintroduction of Gray wolves to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho.
Analysis of the comments revealed 25 issues which are identified and are discussed below.

1. Several conditions on when wolves may be harassed or taken were removed from the final rule. The following conditions
are not part of the final rule_(1) distinction between adult wolves and pups and (2) harassment may only occur for 15
minutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In the discussion of the final rule, it was clarified that after a private individual takes a depredating wolf, no
additional agency actions will be conducted to control problem wolves in an area, unless more livestock depredations
occur. This assumes that the problem wolf was killed, and therefore, no other control actions are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Several terms in the final rule were clarified and defined, including ``opportunistic noninjurious harassment,''
``unintentional take,'' ``disposal of livestock carrion,'' issuance criteria for a wolf take permit to a grazing
lessee on public lands, and criteria for resolving wolf/ungulate conflicts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A termination clause was added to the final rule. The clause clarifies the Service's role and responsibilities
regarding the establishment of an experimental population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Three years following the initial reintroduction of wolves, a thorough review will be conducted. The review will
determine if further reintroductions are required and if, to date, the management program has been successful. A
provision to the rule was added that if the reintroduction and management practices under the experimental population
rule did not result in wolf recovery, the Service would take appropriate actions. Such actions would be caused by the
failure of the wolf population to maintain positive growth for 2 consecutive years. All corrective actions would
be coordinated with affected States, tribes, and other Federal agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Language regarding scientific or technical decisions in discussion of the rule was changed. Design study and reintroduction
techniques may be changed or modified when expert and skilled biologists determine such changes are necessary and
prudent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of relevant issues based on public comments and the Service's response to those issues follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 1:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The subspecies of wolf that occupied the Yellowstone area was 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The reintroduction program will use wolves from Canada which were once classified as a different subspecies; therefore,
this violates the experimental population provision of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In recent times, there have been several revisions to the taxonomic classification of wolves in North America. Several
scientific investigations have dealt with this issue (Brewster and Fritts 1994, Nowak 1994, Wayne et al. 1994). These
investigations concluded (1) there were fewer wolf subspecies than previously believed, (2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
irremotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was not a distinct subspecies, and (3) that wolves might be better classified as types or representative groups of
geographic or climatic conditions rather than distinct subspecies. The northern Rocky Mountains are within the
historic range of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Investigators concluded that reintroduction of wolves from Canada to the Park or central Idaho would accelerate
the ongoing natural southern expansion of the species. Additionally, it was determined that current taxonomic discussions
of wolf subspecies should not affect wolf recovery efforts in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United States.

Issue 2:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amendment to section 10(j) of the Act states that experimental populations may only be designated when there is
geographical separation between the experimental population and other existing populations of the species. The
occasional occurrence of lone wolves in the areas of central Idaho and the Park would prohibit the use of the experimental
population designation since there would be no geographic separation between natural occurring and experimental
wolves. Comments also stated that the boundaries of the experimental areas should be adjusted or the reintroduction
program should be delayed, particularly, in central Idaho due to the presence of naturally occurring wolves.

 For many years, the Service and other agencies have tried to document wolf activity in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming
(Service 1994a, Appendix 12). Since the 1970's, wolf observations particularly from Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho,
have been reported. However, to date the only documented breeding groups of wolves are in northwestern Montana. Based
on scientific inquiry, the Service defines a wolf population as at least two breeding pairs of wild wolves each successfully
raising at least two young each year, for 2 consecutive years, and that a population is composed of breeding groups
of wolves (Service 1994a, Appendix 9). Presently, there are no known breeding pairs of wolves within the experimental
population area. Nor does the experimental area contain any portions of home ranges of any breeding pairs of wolves.
The Service finds that there is no geographic overlap between any Montana wolf population home range and the experimental
area. The northern boundary of the Idaho experimental population area was moved further south because, in 1990 and
1992, there were a few instances when an active breeding group of wolves from Montana were located south of the experimental
boundary recommended in the proposed rule. The rulemaking language now allows revocation of the experimental population
rule and removal of all reintroduced wolves, if within 90 days after the initial reintroduction a naturally occurring
wolf population is discovered in the experimental area. Any naturally occurring wolves will be managed as endangered
species under the Act and afforded the same terms and conditions as wolves in Montana. The Service has had a wolf monitoring
program in place in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming for over two years. This system is designed to accept reports from anyone,
and when a report focuses on a particular area a wolf biologist investigates to verify the presence or absence of wolves.
Through this method the Service has identified newly formed packs in northwest Montana. Within the experimental
area, there has been no confirmation of wolves from any provided reports.

For the past 20 years and presently, the Service and others have searched for wolves in the northern Rocky Mountains.
Reviews of correspondence from the past 25 years show the longstanding and widespread view that wolves already occupied
Idaho and the discovery of their presence imminent. Very extensive monitoring within the experimental population
area has not confirmed the presence of wolves. This particular species is not habitat limited and if allowed to get
into the experimental area would reproduce and survive. The translocation of wild wolves from Canada to central Idaho
will provide the opportunity to start a wolf population. This translocation effort will greatly facilitate recovery
of the gray wolf. The 1987 Rocky Mountain wolf recovery plan recommended an additional 5 years of monitoring for natural
wolf recovery in Idaho. However, the recovery plan provided other options if two breeding pairs of wolves had not become
established in Idaho during the 5 years. Because no breeding pairs have been located, the draft and final EIS and Record
of Decision allow the simultaneous reintroduction of wolves into central Idaho and the Park in an effort to ensure
the viability and conservation of wolves in the Rocky Mountains (Service 1994a, Appendix 16).

The Service proposed a very liberal experimental rule to accommodate concerns of local residents and the affected
States. However, it did not make allowances for unforeseen circumstances that may impede or prevent wolf population
growth and recovery. Options such as increased management or greater numbers of reintroductions should be allowed
if required.

The Service believes that, as proposed, reintroduction and management techniques will result in wolf population
recovery and delisting by about 2002. Rulemaking language was added clarifying that take activities must lead to
eventual recovery of the wolf. Additionally, if there is no progress in achieving wolf population recovery (i.e.,
if wolves in a recovery area do not exhibit positive growth for 2 consecutive years), then factors impacting population
growth will be investigated. Information from the investigation will be made available to the public and appropriate
Federal, State, and tribal agencies. Within a year, the agencies may recommend and implement new management actions
or modifications to their wolf management plans to correct factors negatively impacting wolf recovery. Only as a
last resort would changes or modifications to sections of the experimental rule be made.

The proposed rules' requirements that ``only adult wolves (greater than 50 pounds) can be harassed'' and then ``only
for 15 minutes'' and ``only adult wolves that are witnessed attacking livestock on private land can be killed by private
parties'' are overly restrictive. The provision that wolves can only be killed under a special permit when (1) seen
attacking livestock for the third time on Federal lands, (2) six or more wolf packs are present in the experimental
population, and (3) all agency control efforts have failed does not address the issues in a timely or efficient manner.
The implication that land-use restrictions may be employed on private lands when five or fewer wolf packs are present
in the experimental area also needs clarification.

The Service agrees and has eliminated (1) the distinction between adult wolves and pups for both noninjurious harassment
and take and (2) the length of time wolves may be harassed (as long as physical injury is not incurred). Permittees with
grazing rights on public land can readily obtain a written take permit for wolves seen attacking livestock. However,
issuance criteria still require that prior to issuing the 45-day take permit (1) six or more wolf packs must be present
in the experimental population area, (2) authorized agencies must confirm that a wolf caused the livestock injury
or death, and (3) other agency control actions have failed to resolve the problem. The final rule also clarifies that
no land-use restrictions will be exercised by Federal agencies on private land at any time.

The Service added or clarified definitions and/or language in the final rule. However, the wolf reintroduction program
is complex and has many unforeseen variables. It is impossible to imagine or describe in detail every situation that
might arise during its implementation. Some situations can only be accurately addressed on a case-by-case basis
and judged by their particular circumstances. It is the intent of the Service to use the experimental rule to aid the
conservation, recovery, and eventual delisting of wolf populations in the northern Rocky Mountains of the United
States. The Service in cooperation with other Federal, State and tribal agencies will use the flexibility of the experimental
rule to address local concerns and unforeseen situations. The professional expertise and experience of wildlife
managers will facilitate the implementation and any modifications needed to improve the wolf reintroduction program.
Additional language was added to the rule, clarifying that management flexibility is required as the program is implemented
and refined.

To date, the Federal government has funded the participation of affected States and tribes in regard to the wolf restoration
program. The Service plans to continue its funding commitment within Congressional appropriations until wolves
are delisted. The public stated its concern over the use of taxpayer dollars and the need for government to wisely spend
tax dollars. The Service, therefore, must keep expenses for wolf reintroduction as low as possible while maintaining
an effective program. The Service will encourage the States and tribes to submit reasonable budgets for wolf management
programs, as well as search for ways to pool and coordinate resources so that overall costs are reduced. It is the legal
responsibility of the Service to monitor the progress and adherence of State and tribal agencies to their management
plans. The Service will ensure and work cooperatively with others to meet the stated recovery goals.

In Montana, the Defenders of Wildlife implemented a private livestock compensation program. Because the Defenders
Program has been successful, it was expanded to include Idaho and Wyoming. The Service will not directly fund a livestock
compensation program. The Service will encourage livestock producers to utilize private compensation programs
when depredation occurs. The Service and USDA Animal Damage Control will aid livestock producers by maintaining
an effective control program that minimizes livestock losses due to wolves. The rule addresses the concerns of private
property owners by (1) providing an effective control program, (2) allowing landowners to take wolves on their private
land when justified, and (3) invoking no land-use restrictions on private land. The Service has reviewed the constitutionality
of this rule in regard to protected private property rights. The review concludes the Service's actions do not violate
the private property rights of individuals (Service 1994a, Appendix 6).

 It is well documented that the Service made an extraordinary effort to involve the public and other government entities
in developing management practices and the experimental population rules regarding the wolf reintroduction program.
During the past 3 years, the Service held over 100 meetings, open houses, and hearings. The Service distributed over
750,000 documents and reviewed and considered nearly 170,000 public comments during development of the rule. Federal
agencies and affected States and tribes were active participants during the process. This final rule represents
the participatory work and consensus of affected agencies and others interested or impacted by the rulemaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service is confident in the States' and tribes' ability to evaluate the impact wolf predation may have on ungulate
populations and, when appropriate, implement corrective management actions. An evaluation of possible impacts
and/or actions in regard to a specific ungulate species, and location is best accomplished by biologists most familiar
with the situation. The Service, States, and tribes will coordinate wolf management plans to ensure that State and
tribal interests in native ungulate management are met while meeting the Service's mandate for wolf recovery. Rulemaking
language was added to the section on how States and tribes will manage ungulate/wolf conflicts. States and tribes
are required to prepare acceptable management plans for approval by the Service. It is expected that since these management
plans may affect State wildlife management programs, the States will go through a public review process as part of
their development. Such plans will indicate the point at which wolf/ungulate conflicts become so critical that corrective
action must be taken. A decision to translocate wolves to reduce such conflicts must serve to enhance, or at a minimum
not inhibit, wolf recovery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The timeframes for a person to report the harassing (7 days) and/or the unintentional taking (24 hours) of wolves were
not changed. The harassing or taking of a wolf is a critical and potentially serious event. A person who harasses a wolf
is best served by reporting the incident as soon as possible so agency management actions can be implemented, if necessary.
Submission of a report on wolf harassment provides a record which can document the continuation of suspected or actual
livestock depredations or rationale for taking a wolf. The immediate reporting of livestock depredation by a wolf
also allows the immediate investigation of the incident and gathering of fresh evidence. In Montana, agency professionals
who investigate livestock depredations are readily accessible during the night, weekends, and holidays. During
the past 9 years in Montana, the reporting, documenting, and resolution of livestock depredations have not been significant
issues. Therefore, they are not anticipated to be a problem for wolf reintroductions into the experimental population
areas. The United States legal system often takes into account unusual mitigating circumstances, such as the remoteness
of a livestock allotment interfering with an individual being able to report an incident as required by regulation.
The Service could determine that an incident would not be referred for prosecution when a person failed to meet the
reporting requirements and could justify their actions.

 In accordance with the Act, delisting may occur when analysis of the best available scientific and commercial information
shows that gray wolves are no longer threatened with extinction due to: (1) Loss of habitat, (2) overutilization,
(3) disease or predation, (4) inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms, and (5) other natural or manmade factors.
In addition to the above, the final EIS, states that the following criteria must be met: (1) For 3 consecutive years,
a minimum of 10 breeding pairs are documented in each of the 3 recovery areas described in the revised wolf recovery
plan (Service 1987); (2) protective legal mechanisms are in place; and (3) the EIS evaluation has been completed (Service
1994). After delisting, the Act specifies a species population must be monitored for a 5-year period. After delisting,
if in any 1 of the 3 recovery areas the wolf population fell below the minimum of 10 breeding pairs for 2 consecutive years,
then wolves in that recovery area would be considered for protective status under the Act. Delisting procedures have
been discussed (Service 1994a, Appendix 11). Endangered wolves in northwestern Montana can be downlisted to threatened
once 10 breeding pairs are documented for 3 consecutive years. Experimental populations of wolves cannot be downlisted
because their protective status is based on the experimental population rule. Experimental population rules can
be withdrawn when wolf numbers have reached recovery levels, no further protection under the Act is required, and
the wolf is delisted.

 The Service prepared and published an intra-Service evaluation of its proposed action in the draft and final EIS (Service

would not adversely impact other endangered or threatened species. In November 1994, Service field offices in Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming reviewed the proposed rules and came to the same conclusion. The Service finds that the impact
of the final rules, like the predicated impact reviewed of the proposed rules, will not adversely affect other protected

 The hybridization of wolves with other canids may occur; however, it is not a significant problem anywhere in North
America where ranges of wolves, domestic dogs, coyotes, and foxes overlap (Chapter 1). Thus, it is not anticipated
to be a problem in the northern Rocky Mountains. The rules state the Service or other authorized agencies may remove
reintroduced wolves that breed with domestic dogs, coyotes, or foxes, or their hybrid-offspring. Individual animals
that agency biologists suspect to be domesticated wolves or wild wolf/other canid species hybrids would be removed
from the wild after examination of the canid's physical or behavioral characteristics.

 It is documented that individual wolves may disperse over 500 miles. However, for the past 10 years, there has been
no evidence of naturally occurring wolves dispersing to and producing a viable wolf population in the central Idaho
or Yellowstone areas. After the effective date of the experimental population rules, any such wolves and their offspring
would be treated as experimental population animals. From a practical wildlife management perspective, the Service
cannot be expected to determine if an individual wolf had naturally dispersed into the area or been reintroduced.
The initial reintroduced animals will be radio collared and thus, can be differentiated. Once they have reproduced
it would be impossible to determine if the wolf was a wild dispersing animal or progeny of the experimental animals.
The rule was written to help avoid that possible conflict. Such a distinction, therefore, cannot be treated separately
by regulation. Undoubtedly, the establishment of a viable wolf population and recovery of the species will be enhanced
by the reintroduction of 30 wolves annually for the next 3 to 5 years. The presence of reintroduced wolves may increase
the probability of naturally dispersing wolves from northwestern Montana or Canada to move, stay, and reproduce
in an experimental area. While this event would contribute to population recovery, it would not greatly impact the
overall population growth rate since the majority of breeding wolves would be reintroduced animals.

 Wolves are adaptable to a wide variety of human activities, except for deliberate killing. Experiences in North America
indicate that human disturbance, even around active den sites, is not a significant factor affecting wolf survival
or population growth (Service 1994a, Appendix 13). The rule protects active wolf dens during the earliest stages
of wolf recovery, if necessary. Killing wolves is illegal except for a very few limited exceptions. The rule allows
flexibility to reconsider land use restrictions if wolf populations do not grow toward recovery levels. Wolves in
Montana have not needed land-use restrictions and, at this time, land-use restrictions do not appear necessary for
wolf populations to recover in Idaho or Wyoming.

 The opportunity for private individuals to kill wolves in the experimental population areas is limited to when wolves
are actually in the act of killing livestock. The Service has determined that wolves that exhibit this behavior do
not further the conservation of the species and for that reason are currently controlled (Service 1988). The selective
removal of this type of individual animal by the public is warranted in certain limited circumstances and their removal
contributes to overall conservation of the species. Agency control would be initiated anyway and, under tight regulation,
public control can be more likely to remove the specific problem individual than agency control actions because the
action is taken immediately. If a wolf is taken in the act of depredating, further agency control would not be conducted
unless additional depredations occur. This limited taking of wolves by the private sector could reduce the total
number of wolves that might be taken in response to livestock depredations and reduces the opportunity for other wolves
to feed on or learn to depredate on livestock.

 As stated in the Service's EIS, in the proposed rule, and in the final rule, removal of wolves from Canadian populations
would not significantly impact those populations (59 FR 42110); the likelihood that wolf populations would become
permanently established and grow to recovery level in the experimental areas is extremely high (59 FR 42111); reintroduction
would greatly accelerate wolf population recovery, enhance wolf population viability, and lead to subsequent delisting
(59 FR 42110); and the reintroduced wolves and subsequent population that developed would not be affected by existing
or anticipated Federal or State actions or private activities within or adjacent to the experimental population
area (59 FR 42112); therefore, release of the experimental population would further the conservation of the species
(Service 1994a, Service 1994b).

 The rule clarifies that while the States and tribes are encouraged to lead implementation of the experimental rule,
the Service will monitor and is ultimately responsible for the recovery of the species. Should progress toward wolf
recovery not be evident (two years of no growth would trigger other conservation measures), the Service will cooperate
with the states and tribes to assure steps are taken to resume progress toward recovery. The states and tribes already
have highly trained professional wildlife management programs in place and their expertise, authorities, knowledge,
and organizations can greatly enhance recovery of the species. Animal Damage Control is a professional federal wildlife
management agency that has the responsibility, like all federal agencies, to use their authorities to enhance the
recovery of listed species. Animal Damage Control has been a valuable and necessary component of wolf recovery activities
in Montana and Minnesota.

 The measure of success in the wolf recovery program is not the level of wolf population mortality but growth of the wolf
population. Wolf populations can withstand varying levels of mortality and individual wolf mortality is very difficult
to measure accurately. Language was added to the final rule that clarifies the need to modify the State and tribal plans,
which must be in compliance with the rule, if wolf population growth is not evident. Wolf population growth is easier
to accurately monitor and is the criteria that is used to implement other provisions in the rule (e.g. when lethal control
may be used, when a population is established, when reintroductions stop, and when wolf populations are recovered).
A ``put and take'' strategy does not address the problem of a wolf population failing to maintain growth and is an expensive
process to conduct. It is more productive to identify the factors preventing wolf population growth and correct them
before simply continually adding more wolves that may die from the same causes. A population that required constant
reintroductions to compensate for excessive mortality rates could not be delisted.

 The Service determined the boundaries of the experimental populations based upon the distribution of the wolf population
in Montana. The experimental population boundaries do not include any portion of any known area used by breeding wolves
in Montana. It was also determined that any wolf population inside the experimental boundaries would most likely
be the result of reintroduced wolves and any breeding groups of wolves outside the experimental boundaries would
likely be the result of natural dispersal of wolves from northwestern Montana or Canadian populations. The definition
of a wolf population underwent scientific peer review (Service 1994a, Appendix 8). The rationale and location of
the experimental population boundaries were also reviewed, and no better consensus of a way to define the geographic
range of a wolf population was brought to the Service's attention.

 Once a wolf population is established in an experimental area there is no need to conduct further reintroductions
and to do so would not be cost effective. The soonest the ``wolf population'' criteria could be met is in three years.
At that time about 45 wolves would have been reintroduced to each area. The recovery process and assurance of substantial
genetic diversity, pack formation, and birth of about 10&hyph;20 pups should have occurred following the reintroduction
of 45 animals. This would eliminate the need for additional reintroductions and would allow manpower and funds to
be used on monitoring population growth and dispersal.

 The provisions on legally present livestock are part of the rule so that control of problem wolves will occur only when
livestock are present on public land in a manner already allowed by conditions in their federal, state, or tribal grazing
permit. No new conditions are expected because of wolf reintroduction. Control of wolves that attack livestock should
not be expected when livestock are illegally present on federal lands. Proper livestock husbandry practices means
the current standards and practices used by livestock producers as already determined by the land management agency
issuing the permit. No changes from the standard livestock grazing practices already being used on federal grazing
leases are envisioned. Wolf management in Montana has not affected livestock management practices on public lands
and would likely not affect those practices in other areas. Issues like proper disposal of livestock carrion are already
being addressed in the Yellowstone area because of other concerns such as grizzly bear recovery. Language in the final
rule reflects that carrion must be managed in such a way as not to present a continuing attractant to wolves if problems
occur, but leaves the livestock producer and land management agency to determine how best to address potential problems.

 The Service has reviewed public concern about the accuracy of its early responses to issues raised in the draft and
final EIS, which were also raised by persons commenting on the proposed rule. At this time, the information provided
during the public comment period on the proposed rule does not provide sufficient data or cause for the Service to significantly
change any of its earlier findings which were published in the final EIS regarding the issues of: amending the Endangered
Species Act, wolves as a missing component of the ecosystem, humane treatment of wolves, enjoying wolves, regulated
public take, cost of the program, state, tribal, and federal authority, viable population, travel corridors, range
requirements, control strategies, illegal killing, compensation, delisting, need for public education, spiritual
and cultural significance, social and cultural environment, recovery areas, ungulate populations, hunter harvest,
domestic livestock, land use, visitor use, economics, wolves not native to Yellowstone, wolf rights, federal subsides,
human health and safety, predators and scavengers, other endangered species, other plants, invertebrates, fish,
reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, diseases and parasites, private property rights, wolf recovery in other
areas, existing wolves in Idaho and Yellowstone, existing wolves in northwestern Montana, wolf subspecies, wolf/dog/coyote
hybridization, and the need for research (Service 1994a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service adjusted the experimental population boundaries to exclude any portion of known wolf pack territories
in an effort to reduce the likelihood that any naturally dispersing breeding groups of wolves would fall under the
proposed experimental rule regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, and using the best scientific and commercial data available, and in accordance with 50 CFR 17.81,
the Service finds that releasing wolves into central Idaho constitutes reintroduction into a high-priority site
and will further advance conservation and recovery of this species.

This rule was reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within the experimental
population area, significant economic impacts will not result from this action. Also, no direct costs, enforcement
costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this action and the
rule contains no recordkeeping requirements, as defined in the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rule does not require federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612 because it would not have any significant
federalism effects as described in the order.

Due to biological requirements, the wolf reintroduction program needs to be conducted in November through February,
as recommended by wolf scientists during the EIS process. The nonessential experimental population rule has been
extensively debated and thoroughly investigated during development of the EIS and draft rules. Because of the extensive
public review of the EIS, Record of Decision, and proposed rules, all being similar to this final rule, implementation
of the wolf reintroduction program should start as of the date of publication, without a 30-day waiting period. Therefore,
for good cause and in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Service has determined that the rule should become effective
immediately upon filing for public inspection.

(i) Gray wolf (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis lupus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The gray wolves (wolf) identified in paragraph (i)(7) of this section are nonessential experimental. These wolves
will be managed in accordance with the respective provisions of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Service finds that reintroduction of nonessential experimental gray wolves, as defined in (i)(7) of this
section, will further the conservation of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) No person may take this species in the wild in an experimental population area except as provided in paragraphs
(i)(3), (7), and (8) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Landowners on their private land and livestock producers (i.e., producers of cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service) that are legally using public land
(Federal land and any other public lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service)
may harass any wolf in an opportunistic (the wolf cannot be purposely attracted, tracked, waited for, or searched
out, then harassed) and noninjurious (no temporary or permanent physical damage may result) manner at any time, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such harassment is non-lethal or is not physically injurious to the gray wolf and is reported within 7 days to the
Service project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any livestock producers on their private land may take (including to kill or injure) a wolf in the act of killing,
wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules or as defined in State and tribal wolf management
plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such incidents are to be immediately reported within 24 hours to the Service project leader for wolf reintroduction
or agency representative designated by the Service, and livestock freshly (less than 24 hours) wounded (torn flesh
and bleeding) or killed by wolves must be evident. Service or other Service authorized agencies will confirm if livestock
were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be referred to the appropriate authorities
for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any livestock producer or permittee with livestock grazing allotments on public land may receive a written
permit, valid for up to 45 days, from the Service or other agencies designated by the Service, to take (including to
kill or injure) a wolf that is in the act of killing, wounding, or biting livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules
or as defined in State and tribal wolf management plans as approved by the Service), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that six or more breeding pairs of wolves have been documented in the experimental population area and the Service
or other agencies authorized by the Service has confirmed that the livestock losses were caused by wolves and have
completed agency efforts to resolve the problem. Such take must be reported immediately within 24 hours to the Service
project leader for wolf reintroduction or agency representative designated by the Service. There must be evidence
of freshly wounded or killed livestock by wolves. Service or other Service authorized agencies will investigate
and determine if the livestock were wounded or killed by wolves. The taking of any wolf without such evidence may be
referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Potentially affected States and tribes may capture and translocate wolves to other areas within an experimental
population area as described in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the level of wolf predation is negatively impacting localized ungulate populations at an unacceptable level. Such
translocations cannot inhibit wolf population recovery. The States and tribes will define such unacceptable impacts,
how they would be measured, and identify other possible mitigation in their State or tribal wolf management plans.
These plans must be approved by the Service before such movement of wolves may be conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The Service, or agencies authorized by the Service, may promptly remove (place in captivity or kill) any wolf the
Service or agency authorized by the Service determines to present a threat to human life or safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Any person may harass or take (kill or injure) a wolf in self defense or in defense of others, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that such take is reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Service reintroduction project leader or Service
designated agent. The taking of a wolf without an immediate and direct threat to human life may be referred to the appropriate
authorities for prosecution.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(vii) The Service or agencies designated by the Service may take wolves that are determined to be ``problem'' wolves.
Problem wolves are defined as wolves that in a calendar year attack livestock (cattle, sheep, horses, and mules) or
as defined by State and tribal wolf management plans approved by the Service or wolves that twice in a calendar year
attack domestic animals (all domestic animals other than livestock). Authorized take includes, but is not limited
to non-lethal measures such as: aversive conditioning, nonlethal control, and/or translocating wolves. Such taking
may be done when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in a experimental population area. If the take results
in a wolf mortality, then evidence that the mortality was nondeliberate, accidental, nonnegligent, and unavoidable
must be provided. When six or more breeding pairs are established in the experimental population area, lethal control
of problem wolves or permanent placement in captivity will be authorized but only after other methods to resolve livestock
depredations have been exhausted. Depredations occurring on Federal lands or other public lands identified in State
or tribal wolf management plans and prior to six breeding pairs becoming established in an experimental population
area may result in capture and release of the female wolf with pups, and her pups at or near the site of capture prior to
October 1. All wolves on private land, including female wolves with pups, may be relocated or moved to other areas within
the experimental population area if continued depredation occurs. Wolves attacking domestic animals other than
livestock, including pets on private land, two or more times in a calendar year will be relocated. All chronic problem
wolves (wolves that depredate on domestic animals after being moved once for previous domestic animal depredations)
will be removed from the wild (killed or placed in captivity). The following three criteria will be used in determining
the status of problem wolves within the nonessential experimental population area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) There must be evidence of wounded livestock or partial remains of a livestock carcass that clearly shows that the
injury or death was caused by wolves. Such evidence is essential since wolves may feed on carrion which they found and
did not kill. There must be reason to believe that additional livestock losses would occur if no control action is taken.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There must be no evidence of artificial or intentional feeding of wolves. Improperly disposed of livestock carcasses
in the area of depredation will be considered attractants. Livestock carrion or carcasses on public land, not being
used as bait under an agency authorized control action, must be removed or otherwise disposed so that it will not attract
wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) On public lands, animal husbandry practices previously identified in existing approved allotment plans and
annual operating plans for allotments must have been followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Any person may take a gray wolf found in an area defined in paragraph (i)(7), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the take is incidental to an otherwise lawful activity, accidental, unavoidable, unintentional, not resulting
from negligent conduct lacking reasonable due care, and due care was exercised to avoid taking a gray wolf. Such taking
is to be reported within 24 hours to a Service or Service-designated authority. Take that does not conform with such
provisions may be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Service or other Federal, State, or tribal personnel may receive written authorization from the Service to take
animals under special circumstances. Wolves may be live captured and translocated to resolve demonstrated conflicts
with ungulate populations or with other species listed under the Act, or when they are found outside of the designated
experimental population area. Take procedures in such instances would involve live capture and release to a remote
area or placement in a captive facility, if the animal is clearly unfit to remain in the wild. Killing of wolves will
be a last resort and is only authorized when live capture attempts have failed or there is clear endangerment to human
life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(x) Any person with a valid permit issued by the Service under &sect;17.32 may take wolves in the wild in the experimental
population area, pursuant to terms of the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xi) Any employee or agent of the Service or appropriate Federal, State, or tribal agency, who is designated in writing
for such purposes by the Service, when acting in the course of official duties, may take a wolf from the wild within the
experimental population area, if such action is for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Scientific purposes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) To relocate wolves to avoid conflict with human activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(C) To relocate wolves within the experimental population areas to improve wolf survival and recovery prospects;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) To relocate wolves that have moved outside the experimental population area back into the experimental population
area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) To aid or euthanize sick, injured, or orphaned wolves; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) To salvage a dead specimen which may be used for scientific study; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) To aid in law enforcement investigations involving wolves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(xii) Any taking pursuant to this section must be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the appropriate Service
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service-designated agency, which will determine the disposition of any live or dead specimens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Human access to areas with facilities where wolves are confined may be restricted at the discretion of Federal,
State, and tribal land management agencies. When five or fewer breeding pairs are in an experimental population area,
land-use restrictions may also be employed on an as-needed basis, at the discretion of Federal land management and
natural resources agencies to control intrusive human disturbance around active wolf den sites. Such temporary
restrictions on human access, when five or fewer breeding pairs are established in an experimental population area,
may be required between April 1 and June 30, within 1 mile of active wolf den or rendezvous sites and would only apply
to public lands or other such lands designated in State and tribal wolf management plans. When six or more breeding
pairs are established in an experimental population area, no land-use restrictions may be employed outside of national
parks or national wildlife refuges, unless wolf populations fail to maintain positive growth rates toward population
recovery levels for 2 consecutive years. If such a situation arose, State and tribal agencies would identify, recommend,
and implement corrective management actions within 1 year, possibly including appropriate land-use restrictions
to promote growth of the wolf population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No person shall possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, ship, import, or export by any means whatsoever, any
wolf or part thereof from the experimental populations taken in violation of the regulations in paragraph (i) of this
section or in violation of applicable State or tribal fish and wildlife laws or regulations or the Endangered Species
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) It is unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed any offense
defined in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The site for reintroduction is within the historic range of the species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The central Idaho area is shown on the following map. The boundaries of the nonessential experimental population
area will be those portions of Idaho that are south of Interstate Highway 90 and west of Interstate 15, and those portions
of Montana south of Interstate 90, Highway 93 and 12 from Missoula, Montana west of Interstate 15.

(iii) All wolves found in the wild within the boundaries of this paragraph (i)(7) after the first releases will be considered
nonessential experimental animals. In the conterminous United States, a wolf that is outside an experimental area
(as defined in paragraph (i)(7) of this section) would be considered as endangered (or threatened if in Minnesota)
unless it is marked or otherwise known to be an experimental animal; such a wolf may be captured for examination and
genetic testing by the Service or Service-designated agency. Disposition of the captured animal may take any of the
following courses: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the animal was not involved in conflicts with humans and is determined likely to be an experimental wolf, it will
be returned to the reintroduction area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If the animal is determined likely to be an experimental wolf and was involved in conflicts with humans as identified
in the management plan for the closest experimental area, it may be relocated, placed in captivity, or killed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) If the animal is determined not likely to be an experimental animal, it will be managed according to any Service
approved plans for that area or will be marked and released near its point of capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the animal is determined not to be a wild gray wolf or if the Service or agencies designated by the Service determine
the animal shows physical or behavioral evidence of hybridization with other canids, such as domestic dogs or coyotes,
or of being an animal raised in captivity, it will be returned to captivity or killed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(8) The reintroduced wolves will be monitored during the life of the project, including by the use of radio telemetry
and other remote sensing devices as appropriate. All released animals will be vaccinated against diseases and parasites
prevalent in canids, as appropriate, prior to release and during subsequent handling. Any animal that is sick, injured,
or otherwise in need of special care may be captured by authorized personnel of the Service or Service-designated
agencies and given appropriate care. Such an animal will be released back into its respective reintroduction area
as soon as possible, unless physical or behavioral problems make it necessary to return the animal to captivity or
euthanize it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) The status of the experimental population will be reevaluated within the first 3 years, after the first year of
releases of wolves, to determine future management needs and if further reintroductions are required. This review
will take into account the reproductive success and movement patterns of the individuals released in the area, as
well as the overall health and fate of the experimental wolves. Once recovery goals are met for downlisting or delisting
the species, a rule will be proposed to address downlisting or delisting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) The Service does not intend to reevaluate the ``nonessential experimental'' designation. The Service does
not foresee any likely situation which would result in changing the nonessential experimental status until the gray
wolf is recovered and delisted in the northern Rocky Mountains according to provisions outlined in the Act. However,
if the wolf population does not demonstrate positive growth toward recovery goals for 2 consecutive years, the affected
States and tribes, in cooperation with the Service, would, within 1 year, identify and initiate wolf management strategies,
including appropriate public review and comment, to ensure continued wolf population growth toward recovery levels.
All reintroduced wolves designated as nonessential experimental will be removed from the wild and the experimental
population status and regulations revoked when (i) legal actions or lawsuits change the wolves status to endangered
under the Act or (ii) within 90 days of the initial release date, naturally occurring wolves, consisting of two breeding
pairs that for 2 consecutive years have each successfully raised two offspring, are discovered in the experimental
population area. The naturally occurring wolves would be managed and protected as endangered species under the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on Pretrial Inmates. Changes made in this amendment include
the addition of provisions for the review of the pretrial inmate's status, the replacement of references to waiver
of separation, and a revision of the definition of ``pretrial inmate'' to clarify that the definition does not include
an inmate who is awaiting sentence once the Bureau has received notification of the conviction. This document also
makes several other procedural, editorial, and nomenclature changes. This amendment is intended to update Bureau
of Prisons policy regarding pretrial inmates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is amending its rule on Pretrial Inmates. A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 November 13, 1980 (45 FR 75133). For the convenience of the reader, the entire text of the rule is being published. A
summary of the changes follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The subpart has been revised to remove gender-specific references. In addition, various editorial and conforming
amendments (such as revising ``pre-trial'' to read ``pretrial'') have been made as necessary. These editorial and
conforming amendments make no change in the intent of the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.100 is revised for the sake of clarity and to include a statement that pretrial inmates will be separated,
to the extent practicable, from convicted inmates. The practicability of separation is contingent upon the design,
structure, and operation of the individual institution. Where it is not practicable to keep all pretrial inmates
separate, after intake screening and assessment, Bureau staff may, based upon sound correctional judgment, permit
inmates who do not present a risk to the security or orderly running of the institution to have regular contact with
convicted inmates. As part of its mandate to provide for the care, custody, control, treatment, and instruction of
inmates, the Bureau provides a range of programming opportunities to convicted inmates. These programming opportunities
may be made available to pretrial inmates if staff determine that such would be consistent with institution security
and good order. Pretrial inmates will have the opportunity to discuss separation needs with staff during intake screening
and reviews. Previously, the Bureau provided for inmates to request a waiver of separation. Under this former procedure,
Bureau staff were still responsible for making the determination to maintain or not to maintain separation for pretrial
inmates. This revision, therefore, does not lessen the Bureau's commitment to provide for the safety of pretrial
inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.101 is revised and reorganized for the sake of clarity. New paragraph (a) introductory text is revised
to clarify that ``pretrial inmate'' means a person who is legally detained but for whom the Bureau has not received
notification of conviction. A person who has pleaded or been found guilty and who is awaiting sentence is not considered
to be a pretrial inmate once the Bureau has received notification of conviction. This change is consistent with the
provisions of 18 U.S.C. 3142(i)(2) which states that pretrial inmates are to be kept separate, to the extent practicable,
from persons awaiting or serving sentences. New paragraph (a)(1) substitutes the phrase ``deportable alien'' for
``detained alien'' to better clarify the intent of this paragraph. New paragraph (a)(2) specifies which types of
mental health commitments under 18 U.S.C. Chapter 313 should be considered as pretrial inmates. Inmates who have
been committed to the Bureau for long-term custody and who are not awaiting further court proceedings are not considered
to be pretrial inmates. Former paragraph (a)(2) is reworded and redesignated as new paragraph (a)(3). Paragraph
(b) is revised to remove administrative references to the Judgment and Commitment form. The sentencing court uses
that form to provide notice of conviction to the Bureau, ordinarily following imposition of sentence. Procedures
for receiving notice of conviction are included in implementing instructions to staff.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 551.103 is amended by adjusting the codification designations (former paragraph (a) becomes introductory
text, and subordinate paragraphs (a)(1), (2), etc. become (a), (b), etc.) for the sake of editorial consistency.
The nomenclature used in the introductory paragraph has been revised (the phrase ``institutions with detention-unit
operations'' has been replaced by the phrase ``administrative institutions or institutions with administrative
components housing U.S. Marshals' prisoners''). Newly designated paragraph (e) is revised to remove redundant
information contained in the Bureau's rule on Intake Screening (see 28 CFR 522, subpart C) and to include reference
to separation advisory. Newly designated paragraph (f) is revised to specify that institution guidelines governing
telephone calls, including procedures for making unmonitored calls to an attorney, are provided to pretrial inmates
rather than advice on these guidelines. This revision ensures that pretrial inmates will have complete guidance
on the use of telephones at their disposal. A new paragraph (i) is added to specify that pretrial inmates shall have
the opportunity to waive the right not to work, and former paragraph (a)(9) is redesignated as new paragraph (j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.104 is revised to state that, to the extent practicable, pretrial inmates will be housed separately from
convicted inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.105(a) is revised to clarify that staff ordinarily will supervise a pretrial inmate as if classified
``In'' custody. There is no change in the intent of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.106 has been revised for the sake of clarity. There is no change in the intent of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in statutory authority have removed provision of good time for inmates whose offenses were committed after
November 1, 1987. Consequently &sect;551.107 is removed, and a new &sect;551.107 is added containing provisions
for review of pretrial inmate status. These reviews afford pretrial inmates the opportunity to discuss with staff
factors relating to the inmate's detention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute referenced in &sect;551.109 is changed to reflect the current provision. The intent of this section is
unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.110 has been revised to remove references to waiver of separation. As revised, paragraph (b) specifies
that pretrial inmates who do not participate in religious programs with convicted inmates have access to other religious
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 551.111 is revised to indicate that the U.S. Marshals Service is also to be contacted for comment on a pretrial
inmate's marriage request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.112, paragraph (b) is amended to remove reference to waiver of separation. As revised, this paragraph
specifies that pretrial inmates may be allowed the opportunity to have access to the institution's educational program
when consistent with institution security and good order. Previously, this paragraph stated that such inmate may
have full access. Some Bureau programs, for reasons of institution security and good order, may be inappropriate
for pretrial inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.113, paragraph (a) has been revised to remove reference to waiver of separation and to specify that pretrial
inmates may be allowed the opportunity to receive counseling services with convicted inmates when consistent with
institution and good order. Paragraph (b) has been revised to specify that staff shall ensure that pretrial inmates
who do not receive counseling services with convicted inmates have access to other counseling services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.115, paragraph (a) has been revised to remove reference to waiver of separation and to specify that pretrial
inmates may be allowed the opportunity to participate with convicted inmates in recreational activities when consistent
with institution security and good order or have access to other recreational activities. Paragraph (b) has been
amended to clarify the intended meaning of a pretrial inmate in regular population. As revised, paragraph (b) now
includes a cross reference to conditions for pretrial inmates in Administrative Detention or Disciplinary Segregation.
Paragraphs (d) and (e) have been reordered for organizational reasons. There is no change in the intent of this section.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;551.116, the word ``continuing'' is replaced by the word ``serious''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these changes impose no further restrictions on inmates, deal with agency procedures designed to help ensure
the continued protection of inmates, or conform to statutory provisions, the Bureau finds good cause for exemption
from the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking,
the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning
this rule by writing the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response
in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866;
this rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director,
Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354),
does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

In addition to convicted inmates, the Bureau of Prisons houses persons who have not been convicted. Procedures and
practices required for the care, custody, and control of such inmates may differ from those established for convicted
inmates. Pretrial inmates will be separated, to the extent practicable, from convicted inmates. Except as specified
by this rule, policies and standards applicable to persons committed to the custody of the Attorney General or the
Bureau of Prisons apply also to pretrial inmates as defined in &sect;551.101.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule reduces the Federal reimbursement rate for certain costs of State agencies in administering the
Food Stamp Program. These changes are mandated by the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act of 1993 (Leland Act).
The Leland Act reduces the Federal rate of reimbursement for fraud control, automated data processing development,
and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements costs. This rule proposes to amend Food Stamp Program regulations
to comply with Leland Act mandates on these funding provisions. In addition, this rule proposes to limit the period
that a State agency may retroactively claim Federal funding of administrative costs for Food Stamp Program activities
and allows the costs of certifying Aid to Families with Dependent Children households for food stamps to be charged
to the Food Stamp Program for Federal reimbursement purposes.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This proposed rulemaking has been determined to be significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget
under Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12372
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.551 and information on
State agency administrative matching grants for the Food Stamp Program is listed under No. 10.561. For the reasons
set forth in the final rule and related notice to 7 CFR 3015, subpart V (48 FR 29115), this Program is excluded from the
scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive
effect with respect to any State or local laws, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which
would otherwise impede its full implementation . This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified
in the ``Effective Date'' section of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule
or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp
Program the administrative procedures are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and
7 CFR 273.15;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules
related to non-QC liabilities) or Part 283 (for rules related to QC liabilities);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354,
94 Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980). William Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, has certified
that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will
affect the State and local agencies which administer the Food Stamp Program, by modifying the recordkeeping and reporting
requirements applicable to them, and modifying the rates of Federal funding reimbursement for certain Food Stamp
Program activities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The requirement under the Leland Act to eliminate enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding levels for certain Program activities, resulted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for the Department to revise forms FNS&hyph;366A, Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projection, and SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report to include a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
column for reporting activities funded at the 50 percent funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate. The SF&hyph;269 is a nationwide form required by OMB to be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by all government agencies to report financial status. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department regulations at 7 CFR 3015.84 implemented this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory use of SF&hyph;269. The revisions have been sent to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and have been approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under OMB No. 0584&hyph;0083 for the FNS&hyph;366A and 0505&hyph;0008 for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SF&hyph;269. OMB also requires the use of form SF&hyph;270 when an agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wants to adjust the Program's financial status when the letter-of-credit is not used. The Department regulations
at 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3015.84(b) implemented this mandatory use of SF&hyph;270. A specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the use of form SF&hyph;270 for Food Stamp Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes appears in &sect;277.11 of this proposed action. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form is approved for use by OMB under OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department had inadvertently neglected to inform OMB of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden hours associated with the use of this form for Food Stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program purposes. For Food Stamp Program purposes only, burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with SF&hyph;270 is estimated to average l hour per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response. This estimated burden assumes that each respondent (53 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State welfare agencies) would submit a SF&hyph;270 at least three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times annually. Thus, burden associated with OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will increase an estimated 159 hours annually. Pursuant to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507), the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden estimate will be forwarded to OMB for inclusion into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall burden estimates approved under OMB No. 0505&hyph;0008. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public reporting burden discussed in the previous paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for OMB Nos. 0584&hyph;0083 and 0505&hyph;0008 includes the time for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this burden estimate or any aspect of the information collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State Management Section, Program Accountability Division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affairs, OMB, Room 10235, New Executive Office Building, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Washington, D.C. 20503, Attn: Wendy Taylor, Desk Officer for FNS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining provisions of this proposed rulemaking do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain reporting or recordkeeping requirements subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval by OMB.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Leland Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66), signed on August 10, 1993, made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a number of changes to the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Food Stamp Act). This proposed rulemaking pertains to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative funding rate provisions established in Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13961 of the Leland Act. These provisions are discussed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following paragraphs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most State agency food stamp administrative costs are reimbursed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Department's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal reimbursement rate of 50 percent. However, certain State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency activities are reimbursed at higher or ``enhanced'' rates, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including fraud control, automated data processing (ADP) system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development, and Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(SAVE). Under the current rules in 7 CFR 277.4, 277.15, 277.18, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 277.19 of Food Stamp Program Regulations, the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement rates for these activities were, until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 1, 1994, 75 percent for fraud control, 75 or 63 percent for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADP development, and 100 percent for SAVE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13961 of the Leland Act reduces the Federal reimbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement level. The new rate was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective April 1, 1994 and applies to costs incurred on or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs for a particular activity listed above for which a legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability to pay existed at or before the close of business on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 31, 1994 may be claimed at the enhanced rate in effect at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that time for the particular activity. Costs satisfying this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition are direct costs of goods and other property delivered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to and accepted by the State or local agency; direct costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services rendered to the State or local agency by employees, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, subrecipients and other payees; and associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirect costs. All costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including costs for which obligations (encumbrances) but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liabilities to pay had been created before April 1, 1994, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal reimbursement rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless written approval is subsequently received from FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delaying the effective date, under certain specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, as explained below. If FNS grants such approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the April 1, 1994 effective date, an appropriate adjustment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Federal funding will be made.

On August 10, 1979, the Department published a final rule at 44 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 47037 which allows enhanced Federal reimbursement at the 75 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent rate for food stamp investigations and prosecutions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food Stamp Program regulations also refer to Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement as Federal Financial Participation (FFP). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department set out the procedures for State agencies to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75 percent FFP for fraud control activity in that rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13961 of the Leland Act amended Section 16 of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2025) to reduce the Federal reimbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate for fraud control activity from 75 percent to the regular 50 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent rate. The new rate is effective, by law, on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new rate applies to food stamp investigations, prosecutions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative disqualification hearings, claims collections, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other allowable fraud control activity. It applies to all such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.15 of Food Stamp Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, State agencies are required to submit a fraud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control plan prior to receiving the enhanced funding. A plan is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not currently required under the regulations for standard fraud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding. In Fiscal Year 1993, all State agencies submitted or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended their current fraud control plans and all State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received enhanced fraud funding. The Department is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain the requirement for a fraud control plan. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes a fraud control plan is an important management tool in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combatting fraud and an important component of the State agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan of Operation. Further, because program benefits are fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funded by the Department, the Department has an interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeing that State agencies develop and implement an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraud control plan. However, the Department is proposing to drop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other specific requirements in &sect;277.15 (e.g., job title of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigator, separate claims units, etc.) that pertain solely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhanced funding for fraud control activity. Fraud control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity performed either by investigators or certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers would be eligible for 50 percent funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also proposing to change the timing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of the fraud control plan. Under current rules the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fraud Plan is submitted annually to FNS as an attachment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FNS&hyph;366B, Program Activity Statement, 45 days after the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State's
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fiscal year. For most States which operate on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 1 to June 30 fiscal year, this created an August 15 deadline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the fraud control plan. The Department is proposing a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;272.2(e)(10) which would create a uniform due date of August 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15th for all State agencies, regardless of their 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. The change will ensure that the fraud control plan is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted prior to the start of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fiscal year to which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it applies, and it links submission of the fraud control plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the submission of the Budget Projection Statement which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also due August 15. The Department believes the planning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
budgeting of program activity should be linked since significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in planned activity may also mean changes in Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding. The Department is proposing to make conforming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to &sect;272.2(a), (c)(3), and (e)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department further proposes to remove &sect;277.15 and incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the retained provisions elsewhere in the regulations. As noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the Department intends to retain the fraud control plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in &sect;277.15(c) by incorporating these requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the Plan of Operation requirements at 7 CFR 272.2(d). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;272.2(a)(2), (c)(3), and (d)(1), as appropriate, related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due date of the plan and the relocation of the submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure from (c)(3) to (e)(10). The Department is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to create new requirements for the fraud control plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but to extend the current requirements and change the due date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this plan. The Department is proposing to reserve section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
277.15 for future use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Department is proposing to move the fraud control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan submission requirement to &sect;272.2(d)(1)(xi), the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission requirement in &sect;272.2(c)(3)(i) is being deleted. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deletion of paragraph (i) requires redesignating &sect;272.2(c)(3)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as &sect;272.2(c)(3). Although the wording must be changed slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to accomodate the restructuring of the paragraph, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the current &sect;272.2(c)(3)(ii) for submission of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain interagency agreements are unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also intends to incorporate the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the funding rate for investigations of retail or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wholesale food concerns currently found in &sect;277.15(f)(2), with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slight modification for clarity, into a new paragraph (e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 11, 1982, the Department published a rule at 47 FR 25496 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement section 129 of Public Law 96&hyph;249, which allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhanced FFP at the 75 percent level for costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the planning, design, development, acquisition, or installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ADP systems. On January 19, 1994, the Department published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another final rule at 59 FR 2725 which reduced the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement rate to the 63 percent level effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1991 for system proposals which were approved on or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after November 28, 1990 unless the State had an approved Advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planning Document and had submitted an Implementation Advance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planning Document with all the paperwork required for approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to November 28, 1990. The requirements and procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies for system development at both the enhanced and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard rates of funding were codified in 7 CFR 277.18 of Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Program Rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13961 of the Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Act to reduce the rate of Federal funding for system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development to the regular 50 percent rate. The change in rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new rate applies to costs associated with the planning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, development, acquisition, or installation of ADP systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in the funding rate applies to new proposals as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as proposals approved prior to April 1, 1994 at the enhanced rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of either 75 or 63 percent. Previously approved projects will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be reimbursed at the enhanced rate for costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurred, as defined in the Background section of this preamble, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only through March 31, 1994. The Federal reimbursement rate will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then drop to the regular 50 percent rate for the time remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the approval period. Modifications on or after April 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to existing systems will be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate. All new systems developed on or after April 1, 1994 will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent rate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.18(c), the State agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to acquire ADP equipment or services with enhanced Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding, regardless of the cost, or at the regular funding rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if total acquisition costs meet or exceed $500,000 in Federal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State funds. By dropping enhanced funding, the dollar threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before FNS approval is required for all ADP systems would be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard $500,000 threshold applicable to the regular funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements at &sect;277.18(c). As a result of this change, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications or revisions to systems and services previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved at the enhanced funding rate described at &sect;273.18(c) but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the total cost of the system does not meet or exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$500,000 would no longer be subject to prior FNS approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning April 1, 1994, as long as the total cost of the system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains under $500,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Department will retain most of the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;277.18, but is proposing modifications to that section. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed modifications include the elimination of requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that pertain solely to enhanced funding and retention of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline requirements and dollar thresholds for FNS funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems under the standard funding at &sect;277.18(b), (c)(1)&hyph;(c)(2), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1)&hyph;(d)(2), (e)(1) and (p)(5). In addition, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to retain certain conditions set forth in &sect;277.18(g)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (g)(2) that are currently tied to receipt of enhanced funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since the Leland Act amendments made these conditions applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to receipt of funding at the standard funding rate. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department is proposing that as a condition of receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for funding at the 50 percent standard funding rate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed ADP system must: (1) Assist the State agency in meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of the Food Stamp Act; (2) meet the Model Plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specified in &sect;272.10 of this part; (3) provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more efficient and effective administration of the program; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) be compatible with other such systems used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of State agency plans under the Aid to Families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department proposes to amend &sect;277.18(g)(1) and (g)(2) to set out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these conditions and to revise the heading of the section to read 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Conditions for Receiving FFP.'' The Department is further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to extend the requirements at &sect;277.18(g)(3) to all ADP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. That section currently requires that the proposed ADP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems receiving enhanced funding be Statewide and integrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with AFDC, unless the State agency can demonstrate that a local, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dedicated or single function system will provide for more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient and effective administration of the program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is proposing to modify this requirement so it applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all ADP systems regardless of funding level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;274.12(k) to reflect the elimination of enhanced funding for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are components of complete ADP systems to be developed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with &sect;277.18(g).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 7, 1988 at 53 FR 39433, the Department published a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule which authorized 100 percent Federal funding for State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local agency costs incurred in the verification of the documented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alien status of Food Stamp Program applicants through the SAVE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The requirements to receive the enhanced funding are at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;277.19. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13961 of Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Act (7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 2025) to reduce Federal funding for SAVE activity from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100 percent reimbursement rate to the regular 50 percent rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in rates is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new rate applies to State and local agency costs incurred in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the verification of the documented alien status of Food Stamp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program applicants through the SAVE program. The current rule at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;272.11(e) requires State agencies to submit a SAVE plan as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment to the State agency's Plan of Operation prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving funding. The current rule at &sect;277.19 sets forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required conditions for obtaining 100 percent FFP for SAVE. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is proposing to retain the current requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAVE plan at &sect;272.11 but is proposing to delete &sect;277.19.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current rule at 7 CFR 277.19 requires FNS approval prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquisition of any ADP equipment for SAVE. The proposal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate 7 CFR 277.19 modifies this requirement so that ADP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment for SAVE would require prior approval by FNS only if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost is above the cost thresholds in &sect;277.18. Under current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules in &sect;277.19, non-ADP equipment for SAVE having a net unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of $25,000 or more must receive prior FNS approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, with the elimination of &sect;277.19, the net acquisition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost threshold in Section (B)(3) of Appendix A to 7 CFR Part 277 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would apply. This provision provides that prior FNS approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be required for the acquisition of equipment having a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful life of more than one year and a net acquisition cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than $5,000 per unit after allocation to FNS as projected

for one year after purchase.

biennially and is not scheduled to meet in calendar year 1994. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay may be obtained for such a State only if the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no mechanism for appropriating additional State funds prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next legislative session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Department's intent that State agencies submit their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests to delay the effective date early, and not wait for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of the rulemaking process. It is in the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's interest to apply early for a delay in the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date so a decision on the State agency's request may be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promptly. To allow adequate time for the review of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests prior to the effective date, FNS instructed its regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices to notify State agencies that they would need to submit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their requests to FNS by December 31, 1993. State agencies were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of this deadline in letters which were issued by FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional offices during the last week of October 1993 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first week of November. The Department will, however, consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests submitted after the deadline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A final rule will not be published prior to the April 1, 1994 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date in the Leland Act. The Department has made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions on requests for a delay of the effective date based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the policy set out in the previous notifications to the States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reflected in the following paragraphs of this section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble. Comments on the proposed policy are welcomed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the previous paragraph, a State agency which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes it meets the above criteria for a delay of the effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date was instructed to submit its request to FNS by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 31, 1993 to allow for adequate time for FNS to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department required that the request contain the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Documentation showing that the State legislature meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only biennially; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Documentation showing that the State legislature does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not meet in calendar year 1994; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Certification by the State's chief legal officer, along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with any supporting documentation, that there is no mechanism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the State constitution and laws for appropriating funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the next regular legislative session; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Information as to when the next regular legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session is scheduled to start and, if available, is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of whether a State's laws permit the appropriation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds prior to the next regular legislative session is a legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question. State agencies must provide supporting documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where appropriate such as specific provisions of law dealing with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the State legislature is scheduled to meet in a regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session, and with the appropriation process. The wording of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leland Act essentially requires State agencies to provide proof 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that something does not exist_that no mechanism for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriating funds prior to the next regular legislative session 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists under the State's constitution and laws. However, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be too burdensome for FNS to require that a State agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide FNS a complete set of its laws as proof that no such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in all cases, FNS needs some assurance that a thorough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accurate review of State law has been made. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department proposes that a signed statement from the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chief legal officer_the Attorney General or equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
official_certifying that no such mechanism exists with brief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting documentation, if any, should suffice in most cases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes it is appropriate and necessary for State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to provide such a certification regarding the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It should be noted here that the Leland Act specifies that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be no mechanism for appropriating funding prior to the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular legislative session in order to qualify for a delay of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effective date. The language in the Act refers to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriating mechanism. If the State legislature fails to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate the additional State funds in a regular session, no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay in the effective date will be granted. Also, the Leland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act does not authorize a delay in the effective date if a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislature is scheduled to meet in regular session in calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 1994, but sometime after April 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For some State agencies, the State legislature may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled to meet in regular session during calendar year 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but the State's laws allow the State legislature to be called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into special session or provide other means (other than a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session) by which the State may appropriate additional funds. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for a delay of the effective date should be submitted if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State with a biennial legislature which does not meet in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar year 1994 has no mechanism to appropriate the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State funds under State law other than to call a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative session to appropriate the additional State funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of deciding whether or not to grant a request for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay in the effective date, the Department is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define ``special legislative session'' to mean a legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session that is not scheduled to occur on a regularly scheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. Thus, a regularly scheduled short legislative session in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even number years to consider necessary or emergency bills would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered a regular legislative session. Legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sessions that are not scheduled on a standing regular basis and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be called under State law for a specific purpose would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a special legislative session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is taking this proposed position because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that in many cases a special legislative session could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost a State more than the additional State administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding that would be involved for the Food Stamp Program. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, this position conforms with AFDC's policy and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for implementing Section 13741 of the Leland Act which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes a similar change in Federal reimbursement rates for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AFDC Program. State agencies should note that this position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treats State agencies with biennial legislatures the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether or not the State has called a special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
session in calendar year 1994 for some specific purpose or has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chosen not to call a special session. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also considered how it would interpret the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria in Section 13971 of the Leland Act that a State have ``no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanism, under the constitution and laws of the State, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriating the additional funds required *&blank;*&blank;* before the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such regular legislative session *&blank;*&blank;*'' The Act is not clear as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what kind of appropriating mechanism would meet the test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriation as a sum of money set aside or allotted by official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or formal action for a specific use. Accordingly, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriation mechanisms could be interpreted to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process by which the State legislature or other entities in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State appropriate funds as well as State procedures to set aside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds from discretionary or emergency accounts for specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, State constitutions and laws provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriation by the State's legislature. However, some State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laws also provide other funding mechanisms such as voter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiatives to appropriate funds, procedures allowing State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials or emergency commissions to authorize the spending of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds from the State treasury, another program's revenue account, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or an emergency account, and procedures by which funds previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriated for one program may be transferred to another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. The Department recognizes that while these mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may exist under State law, they may not be useable by the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for several reasons. Voter initiatives to amend the constitution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or law to provide State funding require months just to raise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue to a sufficient number of voters and schedule an election 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are beyond the control of the State. Regarding the spending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of discretionary or emergency funds, State officials would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reluctant to declare an emergency in order to utilize emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to transfer funds from the State Treasury or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accounts to the State's Food Stamp Program for a non-emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose. Further, the interpretation of what is a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriation under State law as opposed to emergency funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer mechanisms varies by State. The Department believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that State legal officers are in the best position to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what are the appropriation mechanisms that are readily available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and useable under the State law. Accordingly, the Department is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to interpret the law to cover only mechanisms by which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State legislature appropriates funding and not to cover voter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiative mechanisms and State transfer mechanisms from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretionary or emergency accounts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In March 1994, the Department approved enhanced funding extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests from four State agencies using this policy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department acted on these requests prior to the rulemaking so the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies affected would know their Federal funding status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the April 1, 1994 effective date mandated in the law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a decision by FNS to grant a delay is made after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 1, 1994, an adjustment will be made so an affected State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency can receive enhanced Federal funding retroactive to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 1, 1994 for eligible costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If approval is granted to delay the effective date, Section 13971 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Leland Act provides that the delayed effective date would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the first day of the first calendar quarter which begins after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the close of the State's regular legislative session. In such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, State agencies would be required to promptly advise FNS in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing as to the actual date the next regular session of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State legislature is completed once such session is completed so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delayed effective date can be determined.

Enhanced Funding for Low Payment Error Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 16(c) of the Food Stamp Act and the current rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;277.4(b), the Federal share of administrative costs specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 16(a) of the Food Stamp Act may be enhanced from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular 50 percent rate to a maximum of 60 percent after the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Federal fiscal year if the State agency qualifies by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieving a low payment error rate. Costs which were eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for greater enhanced funding rates under section 16 (a), (g), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) of the Act (fraud control costs, ADP development, and SAVE) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were ineligible for the 60 percent enhancement. With the drop in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the funding rate to 50 percent, these three activities now become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible along with other costs funded at the 50 percent rate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increased Federal reimbursement rate of up to 60 percent if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State agency meets the low payment error rate specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;277.4. The enhanced funding may only be paid on costs shared at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 50 percent level to State agencies who qualify. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department proposes to amend &sect;277.4, to allow these three new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities to become eligible for the 60 percent enhanced funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by removing &sect;277.4 (b)(1), (b)(10), (b)(11) and (b)(12), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignating the remaining provisions, and by revising newly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated paragraph (b)(7).

Deadline for Filing Claims for Retroactive Funding_Section 277.11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current rules at &sect;277.11 do not limit State agencies from making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims for prior year administrative costs. The one exception is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the provision at &sect;277.15(b) limits 75 percent funding for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraud control activities to prior year costs incurred in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal fiscal year during which a State agency initially applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 75 percent funding. However, State agencies may make claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for prior year fraud control activities at the 50 percent Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement rate with no time limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies are currently required at &sect;277.11 to submit a Form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report, on a quarterly basis to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program costs and to support the claims made for Federal funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final reports are due December 30 for the preceeding Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fiscal year which runs from October 1 through September 30. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, after the fiscal year is over, State agencies may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request retroactive funding for past years or pay back FNS for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertent overclaims by submitting an SF&hyph;270, Request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advance or Reimbursement. It is the SF&hyph;270 adjustments which, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under current rules potentially may go on without end. In Fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Years (FY) 1991 through 1993, FNS received SF&hyph;270 requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive funding from State agencies going back as far as FY 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1981 and SF&hyph;270 payments from State agencies to FNS going back to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FY 1979 and prior years for the Food Stamp Program.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department proposes to amend &sect;277.11 to add a new paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)(1) which would limit the time period during which State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies may file a request for retroactive funding. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended effect of this proposal is to limit State agency and FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources toward the present operation of the program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes State agencies have a responsibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly claim Federal funding on a timely basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other Federal programs currently have claim limitations in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits on grants to State agencies for the Aid to Families with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dependent Children and Medicaid Programs. For example, in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, DHHS will reimburse a State agency only if the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency files a claim for an expenditure within two years after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calendar quarter in which the State agency made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenditure. In this rule, the Department is proposing a similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation for the Food Stamp Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposes in new &sect;277.11(d)(3) to provide, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the availability of funds, FNS would reimburse a State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency for an allowable expenditure at the appropriate Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reimbursement rate only if the State agency files a claim with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FNS for that expenditure within two years after the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of 75 percent funding for fraud control activity, the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two-year limit would apply to claims for retroactive 75 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fraud funding but there would be an additional limit in that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retroactive funding would not be available prior to the year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the State agency applied for 75 percent funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Department proposes in new &sect;277.11(d)(2) to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that subject to the availability of funds and any required FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval related to the Advance Planning Document under 7 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
277.18(c), FNS would reimburse State agencies for the purchase of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automated data processing (ADP) equipment and services at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate reimbursement rate in effect at the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment or service was received only if the State agency files 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a claim with FNS for that expenditure within two years after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calendar quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed time limit applies to ADP expenditures approved for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funding at the enhanced rate and at the regular rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's proposal in new &sect;277.11(d)(4) would provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain exceptions to the two-year limit. State agencies may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request a waiver of the time limit in writing in advance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadline. In order to be granted by FNS, the request must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include supporting explanation, justification and documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, as set forth in proposed &sect;277.11(d)(5) the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit would not apply to audit exceptions, or where FNS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines there was good cause resulting from circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the State agency's control for filing a late claim. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
audit exception means a proposed adjustment by the Department to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any expenditure claimed by a State agency by virtue of an audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Department's proposal would limit the time period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the use of the SF&hyph;270 to repay FNS for an overclaim to three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years from the end of the Federal fiscal year unless litigation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an audit, or a claim is pending at the end of the three-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. FNS reserves the right to assert a claim against State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies for amounts due when an SF&hyph;270 is not submitted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agency to repay any money due FNS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that under the current program rules at &sect;277.12, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies are required to maintain all financial records for three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years unless there is pending litigation, or an unresolved audit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or claim. If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the expiration of the three-year period, the applicable records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be retained until these have been resolved. The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not proposing any changes to these record retention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in this rule.

AFDC/Food Stamp Certification Costs_Section 277.9

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also proposing amendments to current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to correspond to current practice related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charging of certain food stamp certification costs to the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stamp Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulations at &sect;277.9 provide that any cost related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determining the Food Stamp Program eligibility of Aid to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) cases is to be included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the AFDC determination costs and claims and not as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable cost for FNS reimbursement. However, beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1983, as a result of a Memorandum of Understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Department and DHHS, the Department changed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy, but not the regulatory provision, so that the incremental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of certifying AFDC households for Food Stamp Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits shall be charged to FNS, not to the Office for Family 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistance, DHHS. State agencies were notified by FNS regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices of this change in August 1983. Beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 1, 1983, State agencies have been allowed to charge such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs to FNS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing that this longstanding practice be codified in the Food Stamp Program Regulations. The
Department proposes to amend &sect;277.9(b) to provide that the incremental cost of certifying AFDC cases for food
stamp benefits would be an allowable cost for FNS reimbursement at the standard Federal reimbursement rate. This
proposed provision modifies program regulations so that they conform to current policy and practice.

Effective Dates and Implementation Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is proposing that all the provisions in &sect;277.11 regarding time limits for State agencies to file
claims to amend a prior expenditure report to request retroactive funding for costs previously incurred will be effective
the first day of the first calendar quarter occurring not less than 60 days following publication of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposes that the provision at &sect;277.9(b) on the charging of food stamp certifications of AFDC
households become effective 30 days following publication of the final rule since it does not require any special
implementation efforts on the part of State agencies since the change merely conforms the regulations to current
practice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Section 13971 of the Leland Act, the reduction in FFP rates mandated by Section 13961 of the Leland Act was
effective on April 1, 1994, unless the Department grants a delay in certain limited circumstances, as specified in
this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the last week of October and the first week of November 1993, the Department briefed State agencies administering
the Food Stamp Program on how to implement the new Federal funding rates for FNS&hyph;366A, Budget Projection, and
SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report, actual cost reporting and payment purposes effective April 1, 1994. The prompt
implementation was necessary prior to rulemaking to comply timely with the Leland Act's mandate to reduce the Department's
share of State agency administrative costs to the mandated rate as of April 1, 1994, and to minimize the need for revised
reporting by State agencies related to budget projections for FY 1994 and actual cost reporting on or after April 1,
1994. It also gave lead time to State agencies opting to seek from their State legislatures additional State funds
to offset the reduction in the rate of Federal funding. State agency budget projections for FY 1994 should take into
account the new funding rate as of April 1, 1994. Beginning April 1, 1994, State agencies began drawing down Federal
funds for expenditures based on the new funding rate for these activities. Effective with the third quarter Fiscal
Year 1994 SF&hyph;269 report, State agencies will begin reporting costs using the new funding rate for these activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs incurred by the State or local agency on or after April 1, 1994 will be claimed at the regular 50 percent Federal
reimbursement rate. State agencies currently report the amount of Federal funds requested on the FNS&hyph;366A,
Budget Projection, and actual costs on the SF&hyph;269, Financial Status Report. For reporting purposes, the Department
is proposing to require State agencies to begin reporting budget and cost information using the new lower Federal
reimbursement rate for costs incurred for periods beginning on or after April 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13961 of the Leland Act, which reduces the enhanced funding for fraud control, ADP development, and SAVE costs,
applies, by its terms, to costs incurred on or after April 1, 1994. The deadline for submitting a request to delay the
effective date for the reduction in enhanced funding is December 31, 1993 as specified in letters sent by FNS regional
offices to State agencies in the last week of October and the first week of November 1993. However, the Department will
consider requests submitted after that date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conforming amendments to Food Stamp Program regulations in &sect;&sect;272.2, 272.11, 272.13, 274.12, 277.4,
277.15, 277.18, and 277.19 will be effective 30 days following publication of the final rule.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to bring the regulations into conformity with the Leland Act. Publication of the rule does not change
the implementation guidance which was issued by the Department beginning in late October 1993. The Department is
merely proposing to incorporate the new Federal reimbursement rate for these activities into the regulations. Although
the Department has taken action to ensure prompt implementation of the new reimbursement rate effective April 1,
1994, this rulemaking is still necessary in order to conform the regulations to the new rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department requests public comments because they may be beneficial to the rulemaking. However, commenters should
note that the new Federal reimbursement rate and the implementation date for the reduction in the Federal reimbursement
rate were mandated in the Act and are not items involving Departmental discretion. Only the decision of whether a State
agency has demonstrated that it meets the criteria for a delay of the effective date involves some degree of Departmental
discretion. Any comments received by the deadline stated above for comments will be considered prior to publication
of a final rulemaking.

Time Limit for State Agencies to File Claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) After the deadline in paragraph (c)(4) of this section for the final Form SF&hyph;269 report, State agencies shall
use the Form SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, as needed within three years of the end of the Federal
fiscal year to amend a prior expenditure report pertaining to such Federal fiscal year. The three-year reporting
deadline may be extended by FNS if litigation, an audit, or a claim is unresolved at the end of the three-year period.
The SF&hyph;270 shall be used to amend prior expenditure reports, and to request reimbursement for any additional
funding due or to pay back to FNS any inadvertent prior overclaim. Requests for reimbursement will only be honored

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the claim is filed within the timeframe in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. FNS reserves the right to bill State
agencies for amounts due FNS due to an overclaim even if no SF&hyph;270 has been submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Subject to the availability of funds from the appropriation for the year in which the expenditure was incurred,
FNS may reimburse State agencies for an allowable expenditure only if the State agency files a claim with FNS for that
expenditure within two years after the calendar quarter in which the State agency obligated the funds. FNS will consider
non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting
records of the State agency in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For Automated Data Processing (ADP) expenditures approved under &sect;277.18(c), subject to the availability
of funds and required FNS approval related to the Advance Planning Document, FNS may reimburse State agencies for
allowable expenditures at the appropriate rate in effect at the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment or service was received only if the State agency files for a claim with FNS within two years after the calendar
quarter in which the funds were obligated. FNS will consider non-cash expenditures such as depreciation to have been
made in the quarter the expenditure was recorded in the accounting records of the State agency in accordance with generally
accepted accounting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Waiver requests for an extension of the deadline in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section may be granted
by FNS only if the request was submitted in writing to FNS prior to the applicable deadline. The State agency's request
for a waiver must include a specific explanation, justification, and documentation of why the claim will be late and
when the claim will be filed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The time limits in paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section will not apply to any of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Any claim for an adjustment to prior year costs previously claimed under an interim rate concept; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Any claim resulting from an audit exception; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Any claim resulting from a court-ordered retroactive payment. However, this provision does not bind FNS to
a State or Federal decision when FNS was not a party to the action; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Any claim for which FNS determines there was good cause for the State agency's not filing it within the time limit.
Good cause is lateness due to circumstances beyond the State agency's control such as Acts of God or documented action
or inaction of the Federal Government. It does not include neglect or administrative inadequacy on the part of the
State, State agency, legislature, or any of their offices or employees.

of ADP equipment or services to be utilized in an EBT system regardless of the cost of acquisition. A State agency shall
also obtain prior written approval from FNS when it plans to noncompetitively acquire ADP equipment or services from
a nongovernmental source which cost more than $100,000 in Federal and State funds. The State agency shall request
prior FNS approval by submitting the Planning APD or Implementation APD signed by the appropriate State official

or installation of ADP and information retrieval systems if the proposed system will:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Assist the State agency in meeting the requirements of the Food Stamp Act;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Meet the program standards specified in &sect;272.10(b)(1), (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this chapter, except for the
requirements in &sect;272.10 (b)(2)(vi), (b)(2)(vii) and (b)(3)(ix) of this chapter to eventually transmit data
directly to FNS;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Be likely to provide more efficient and effective administration of the program; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Be compatible with other such systems utilized in the administration of State agency plans under the program
of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State agencies seeking FFP for the planning, design, development or installation of automated data processing
and information retrieval systems shall develop Statewide systems which are integrated with AFDC. In cases where
a State agency can demonstrate that a local, dedicated, or single function (issuance or certification only) system
will provide for more efficient and effective administration of the program, FNS may grant an exception to the Statewide
integrated requirement. These exceptions will be based on an assessment of the proposed system's ability to meet
the State agency's need for automation. Systems funded as exceptions to this rule, however, should be capable to the
extent necessary, of an automated data exchange with the State agency system used to administer AFDC. In no circumstances
will funding be available for systems which duplicate other State agency systems, whether presently operational
or planned for future development.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action proposes several changes in Food Stamp Program rules relating to the limit on deductible excess shelter
expenses and use of standard utility allowances. The major change would implement a provision of the Mickey Leland
Childhood Hunger Relief Act as set forth in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The provision would increase
Program benefits to households that have no elderly or disabled members by gradually increasing and then, in 1997,
removing the limit on the amount of excess shelter expenses these households can deduct from their income to determine
eligibility and benefits. The changes in provisions for standard utility allowances would allow State agencies
to use allow use of additional standards and would simplify requirements for determining entitlement to a standard.

1. Excess Shelter Cap_7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) and 273.9(d)(8)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under current rules at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5), households are entitled to a deduction from income for excess shelter expenses,
i.e., shelter expenses (including rent or mortgage and utilities) that exceed 50 percent of the household's net income
remaining after all other deductions. For households with an elderly or disabled member (as defined in 7 CFR 271.2),
all of the excess shelter expenses are deducted. For other households, only excess shelter expenses up to a limit are
deducted. This limit, usually referred to as the ``shelter cap,'' is adjusted annually to reflect changes in the shelter,
fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30. In FY 1994, the cap is $207 for the contiguous 48 States and
the District of Columbia, $359 in Alaska, $295 in Hawaii, $251 in Guam, and $152 in the Virgin Islands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13912 of the Mickey Leland Childhood Hunger Relief Act (Leland Act), Chapter 3, Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, enacted August 10, 1993, 107 Stat. 312), amended section 5(e) of
the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (as amended), (the Act) 7 U.S.C. 2014(e), to provide for incremental increases in the shelter
cap and for the elimination of the cap according to the following schedule:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Effective July 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $231 a

in the Virgin Islands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Effective October 1, 1995 through December 31, 1996, the excess shelter expense deduction shall not exceed $247

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
According to the legislative history of the Leland Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Congressional Record,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 S10725, August 6, 1993), the changes in the shelter cap are designed to provide more food stamps to families with especially
high rent and utility bills. To implement section 13912 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 7 CFR 273.9(d)(8) will be amended to
add the statutorily imposed increased shelter cap amounts effective in July 1994 and October 1995 and to indicate
that the shelter cap will be eliminated effective January 1, 1997. Those regulatory changes are mandated by statute
and, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), are therefore not subject to public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action proposes to amend the homeless shelter expense provisions of 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) to eliminate the reference
to the excess shelter cap. Current regulations provide that State agencies may develop their own standard estimate
of the shelter expenses of households in which all members are homeless and do not receive free shelter throughout
the month. State agencies that do not want to develop their own standards may use the estimate provided by the Department.
The regulations provide that this homeless shelter estimate will be updated annually using the same method as is used
to index the excess shelter cap. Since the excess shelter cap will be set at the amounts established by the Leland Act
beginning July 1, 1994 and will be removed in January 1997, we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) effective July
1, 1994 to provide that the homeless shelter expense estimate will be revised each October 1 to reflect changes in the
shelter, fuel, and utilities components of housing costs in the CPI-U for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30.
The homeless shelter estimate will be adjusted on October 1, 1994 and each October 1 thereafter. State agencies will
be notified of the amount by memorandum prior to each change. State agencies will still have the option of developing
and using their own estimates.

2. Standard Utility Allowances_7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The legislative history of the Leland Act (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Congressional Record,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 S10725, August 6, 1993 and House Report 103&hyph;213, p. 924, August 4, 1993) indicates Congressional intent that
the excess shelter expense deduction be simple to administer and that the standard utility allowance facilitate,
rather than hinder, program simplification. We have reviewed the regulations governing shelter expenses and utility
standards to determine how they might be improved. As a result, we are proposing to revise 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) in its entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act (7 U.S.C. 2014(e)), Congress authorized use of a standard utility allowance (standard)
in computing a household's excess shelter deduction to reduce the burden on State agencies and households of having
to report, verify, and calculate actual utility costs. However, subsequent legislation and numerous regulatory
revisions have resulted in increasingly complicated requirements for use of the standards. State agencies have
complained that current regulations are confusing and, by their very complexity, defeat the purpose of using standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules published October 17, 1978 (43 FR 47846, 47865&hyph;66) required State agencies to establish a standard utility
allowance which households could include in claiming their shelter costs. Households that incurred costs for electricity
and fuel for heating, cooling, or cooking were allowed to use the State agency's single utility standard which included
these costs. Alternatively, States were allowed to develop separate standards for each utility. A household incurring
a cost for any of these utilities was allowed the option of claiming actual costs or the standard in the calculation
of benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To give State agencies more flexibility in operating the Program, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982,
Pub. L. 97&hyph;253, (September 8, 1982, 96 Stat. 775&hyph;6), made use of a standard utility allowance a State agency
option. In doing so, the use of the standard became more complex. Use of a single standard that included heating or cooling
costs was restricted to those households that incurred heating or cooling costs separately from their rent or mortgage.
However, households in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
public 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
housing who were billed only for excess usage were prohibited from using this standard. These households were required
to use actual expenses. The law also required State agencies to prorate the standard among separate households who
lived together and shared heating or cooling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interim regulations implementing the provisions of Pub. L. 97&hyph;253 were issued on November 16, 1982 (47 FR 51551)
and made final on June 21, 1983 (48 FR 28190). (Readers may refer to the preambles of these regulations for a full explanation
of the changes.) The rules implemented the prohibition against use of a heating or cooling standard by households
in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
public
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 housing. In addition, the rules provided that renters in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
private
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 housing could receive the heating or cooling standard only if the amount of heating or cooling usage was established
through a separate meter. Households not entitled to the heating or cooling standard could claim actual costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Legislation governing the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEA) program also has had an effect on use of the heating
or cooling standard by households receiving LIHEA and further complicated this policy. The Low-Income Home Energy
Assistance Act of 1981, Title XXVI, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, enacted August 13, 1981, (42 U.S.C. 8621, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) required State agencies to exclude LIHEA payments from income in assistance programs, including the Food Stamp
Program. Under the food stamp rules, households that received direct LIHEA payments and still incurred a heating
or cooling expense in excess of the LIHEA payments were allowed use of the heating or cooling standard. However, households
that received LIHEA assistance in the form of vendor payments made to the energy provider were not entitled to the heating
or cooling standard. Section 273.10(d)(1)(i) provided that any expense covered by an excluded reimbursement or
vendor payment was not deductible. As early as 1981, lawsuits were filed challenging the Department's position on
this issue. (See

The Food Security Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99&hyph;198 (December 23, 1985) amended the Food Stamp Act to provide that households
which incurred out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses over and above their LIHEA or similar energy assistance
payments were entitled to receive a standard allowance for heating or cooling costs. In the context of entitlement
to a heating or cooling standard, out-of-pocket expenses are those that exceed any energy assistance payments made
to or on behalf of the household. The law allowed State agencies to develop two standard allowances including heating
or cooling expenses: One standard for households that did not receive indirect energy assistance payments and a second
standard for households that received indirect payments and incurred out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses.
(The preamble to regulations published May 21, 1986, 51 FR 18744, 18746, contains a complete explanation of the provisions.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the Food Stamp Act made by the Food Security Act of 1985 were nullified by the Human Services Reauthorization
Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99&hyph;425 (September 30, 1986), which included a provision affecting the treatment of LIHEA
payments in calculating an excess shelter expense deduction. Section 504(e) of that law provided that LIHEA payments
must be treated consistently regardless of how the payments are distributed to the household and that the full amount
of the payments was to be deemed expended by the household for heating or cooling expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final rule published February 23, 1987 (52 FR 5434) amended 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) and 7 CFR 273.10(d)(1)(i) to require
State agencies to consider energy expenses covered by LIHEA payments made to the energy supplier on behalf of the household
(indirect payments) as deductible shelter expenses. State agencies were required to consider all households receiving
LIHEA as eligible to claim the heating or cooling standard whether or not the household had any out-of-pocket expense.
The rule eliminated a State agency's option to use a separate heating or cooling standard allowance for those households
which received indirect LIHEA payments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State agencies have indicated that the legislative conflict between the desire to avoid reducing a household's food
stamp allotment when it receives energy assistance and the principle that the heating or cooling standard should
be allowed only when a household actually incurs an out-of-pocket heating or cooling expense has resulted in regulations
that are error-prone and difficult to administer. Numerous policy memoranda and clarifications have been issued
to assist State agencies in determining the circumstances under which a household is entitled to a heating or cooling
standard. However, State agencies continue to raise questions concerning use of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the constraints of the Food Stamp Act and legislation governing the LIHEA program, we are proposing to revise
7 CFR 273.9(d)(6) to assist State agencies in using a heating or cooling standard and to provide greater flexibility
in developing other standards. Under this proposal, provisions relating to standard utility allowances would be
organized into the following areas: (a) Developing and updating standard utility allowances, (b) entitlement to
a heating or cooling standard, (c) household option, and (d) sharing utility costs. We are also proposing to add the
last sentence of current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) regarding allowable cooling costs to the list of allowable utility
costs in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C) so that all allowable utility costs are listed in one paragraph. The proposed changes
are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Developing and updating standard utility allowances. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i), (iii), (iv),
(v), and (vi) set forth the requirements for developing standard utility allowances. They allow State agencies to
use seasonal standards; annual standards that do not have to be adjusted seasonally; separate standards for each
utility expense; or single utility standards that include the cost of heating or cooking fuel, cooling, electricity,
water, sewerage, garbage or trash collection, and the basic service fee for one telephone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to ease confusion and clarify the rules regarding the establishment of utility standards, we are proposing
to consolidate the current rules into a single, revised paragraph, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i). At the same time, we are proposing several changes in existing policy. The changes in policy
are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several State agencies have requested and have been granted waivers to use a combined standard for all nonheating
or noncooling expenses. As justification for their waiver requests, State agencies cite difficulty in obtaining
verification for utility expenses and, consequently, increased errors relating to shelter costs when certifying
households. To provide greater State agency flexibility without the need for waivers and to reduce the error-prone
use of actual utility expenses, we are proposing in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) to allow State agencies to develop standard
utility allowances for individual utilities and a combination of utilities. As provided in current regulations,
the allowances may be seasonal or annualized to include costs for all seasons and may be varied by household size or
geographic location. Although the proposal for a combined standard is not as broad as some standards currently in
use, we believe it would provide some additional flexibility to State agencies and would reduce the number of cases
in which workers must verify actual expenses without greatly increasing Program costs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i) and under our proposal, State agencies would not be permitted to develop
a separate standard or decrease the heating or cooling standard for households that receive LIHEA payments. However,
a State agency would be able to develop and use a separate heating/cooling standard for households that receive energy
assistance other than energy assistance provided under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. In developing
other standard utility allowances, State agencies would be required to include only the allowable costs identified
in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C). No additional costs could be added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under the proposed revision of 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(i), State agencies would be allowed to develop the following
standards: (a) A separate standard for each type of utility expense; (b) a standard that includes heating or cooling
costs; (c) a telephone standard; and (d) a combined standard that includes electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage
or trash collection and is available only to households that incur the cost of electricity and either water or sewerage.
State agencies would be allowed to add the telephone standard to a separate standard for electricity, for example,
for households that incur both expenses. The telephone standard could also be added to the combined standard to allow
use of a standard for households that incur costs for electricity, sewerage or water, and telephone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies could use the heating or cooling standard for households that incur a heating or cooling cost and an
individual standard for households that incur an expense for only one utility, such as electricity. Because State
agencies may develop a variety of standards, the proposed rule specifies that no household shall receive more than
one standard for the same utility expense. For example, if the State agency's combined standard includes the expense
of a basic telephone, a household that receives the combined standard would not also be entitled to a separate telephone
standard. Households whose only utility expense is for a telephone would be entitled to the telephone standard only.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would require State agencies that develop new standard utility allowances to use FCS-approved methodologies.
The State agency would be required to review the standards annually and submit revised amounts to FCS for approval.
State agencies would be required to submit methodologies used in developing and updating standards to FCS every 3
years. They would also be required to submit the methodologies when they are revised or upon a request from FCS. We are
requiring State agencies to submit methodologies every 3 years so that we will be able to monitor State agency development
and use of standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Entitlement to a heating or cooling standard. Another complex and confusing area of policy involving standard
utility allowances is determining who is entitled to a standard that includes heating or cooling costs. We are proposing
in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(ii) to clarify and simplify these rules. In doing so, we are attempting to eliminate
inequities that exist in the application of current policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii) provide that a heating or cooling standard shall be made available only
to households that incur out-of-pocket heating and cooling costs separately from their rent or mortgage and to households
that receive LIHEA. Renters must be billed on a monthly basis by their landlords for actual usage as determined through
individual metering to be entitled to use the standard. Recipients of indirect energy assistance payments other
than LIHEA must incur expenses in excess of the payments during the certification period to qualify for the heating
or cooling standard. Households in public or private housing with a central meter who are billed only for excess usage
are not permitted to use the standard. A household not entitled to the standard can claim actual expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, provisions of interim regulations published November 16, 1982 (47 FR 51551) and finalized June
21, 1988 (48 FR 28190) limited use of the heating or cooling standard by households in public or private housing to those
households whose costs could be verified by separate metering. Previously, households in public or private housing
who could verify that they incurred heating or cooling costs separately from their rent were entitled to use the heating
or cooling standard. Although these households were no longer entitled to a heating or cooling standard under food
stamp rules, they were entitled to the heating or cooling standard if they received LIHEA. Therefore, State agencies
had to determine which households would or would not receive LIHEA before food stamp eligibility and benefits could
be determined. This presented a problem for State agencies, particularly when there was no easy method for exchanging
information with the LIHEA agency. Although this policy has been in effect for some time now, State agencies still
experience difficulty in anticipating entitlement to a heating or cooling standard when a household is entitled
solely because of receipt of LIHEA payments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our first proposed change to the rules governing the use of a heating or cooling standard is to provide direct entitlement
to a standard by households in private housing who have heating or cooling costs apart from or in addition to their rent.
Under the proposal, these households would be entitled to use the heating or cooling standard even if their actual
utility usage is not determined by separate metering. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of the expense could be determined and verified by means other than separate metering, such as a statement
from the landlord. If, in addition to rent, the landlord charges a flat amount for utilities each month which includes
the cost of heating or cooling, the household would be entitled to the heating or cooling standard. Regulations at
7 CFR 273.2(f)(1)(iii) do not require State agencies to verify entitlement to a standard allowance. However, entitlement
to a standard may be verified if it is questionable, as provided in 7 CFR 273.2(f)(2)(i) or under 7 CFR 273.2(f)(3) as
a State agency option. The proposed rule retains the statutory prohibition against use of the heating or cooling standard
by households in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
public
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed change would extend use of the standard to households that live separately but share a utility meter.
Under current policy, if two households live separately but have one meter, the households are prohibited from sharing
the standard, and the State agency cannot grant the standard to both households even though both incur heating or cooling
costs. Under the proposed change, the State agency would be required to grant the full heating or cooling standard
to both households if both incur or anticipate incurring out-of-pocket heating or cooling expenses separately from
their rent or receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second proposed change in the standard utility allowance rules stems from numerous policy questions that have been
raised regarding when and how often a household has to incur an expense in order to be eligible for an annualized heating
or cooling standard. As indicated above, State agencies currently may choose between seasonal heating or cooling
standards and an annualized standard that includes year-round heating and cooling costs. State agencies have complained
that regulations and policy regarding use of an annualized standard are confusing and difficult to administer. We
are proposing in this rule to simplify the regulations for determining when a household is entitled to an annualized
standard utility allowance that includes heating or cooling costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annualized standards represent the average monthly heating and cooling costs for the entire year. This means that
in some months during the year, and perhaps during the certification period, the household may not have any heating
or cooling costs. For example, a household that previously had no heating or cooling costs applies in June and does
not anticipate incurring any heating or cooling costs during the summer months. However, the household will incur
heating costs in the fall. Regulations at 7 CFR 273.10(d)(4) provide that the State agency shall calculate a household's
expenses based on the expenses the household expects to be billed for during the certification period. Therefore,
if the household above is certified for three summer months and incurs no heating or cooling costs, the household is
not entitled to an annualized standard that includes heating costs. If the household is certified for six months and
anticipates incurring heating costs in the fall, however, it is entitled to the heating standard. State agencies
have complained that this policy is difficult to administer and can result in inequities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To reduce the problems associated with determining when a household is entitled to an annualized heating or cooling
standard, we are proposing in this rule that a household that currently incurs or expects to incur out-of-pocket heating
or cooling costs during the next heating or cooling season (except a household in public housing with a central meter
where the household is billed only for excess usage) is entitled to an annualized heating or cooling standard regardless
of when the certification period begins or ends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule further proposes that the household shall continue to be entitled to the standard until it no longer expects
to incur heating or cooling costs during the next heating or cooling season. The State agency would be required to reexamine
a household's entitlement to the heating or cooling standard at recertification, when the household moves, or when
the household voluntarily reports a change affecting entitlement to the standard.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this proposal, a household with no heating or cooling costs which is certified for three summer months and which
expects to be billed for heating costs in the fall would be entitled to a heating or cooling standard at the time of certification.
Also, a household that incurred no heating or cooling expenses in the past which moves to a living arrangement where
it will incur heating costs in the next heating season would be allowed the annualized standard from the time of the
move. If a State agency uses seasonal standards, households would be entitled to the appropriate seasonal standard
if they incur or expect to incur a qualifying expense (or receive or expect to receive a LIHEA payment) during the season
covered by the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe this proposal is more equitable and easier to administer than current policy. We would appreciate specific
comments supporting the proposal or pointing out any problems with the proposed change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although food stamp households are categorically eligible for LIHEA, not all food stamp households receive the assistance,
either because they do not apply for it or because LIHEA funds run out before all eligible households can be served.
This makes it extremely difficult for State agencies to know in advance whether or not a household will receive LIHEA
and be entitled to the standard. To grant the standard beginning with the month the household reports receipt of LIHEA
would not meet the intent of the LIHEA legislation. Therefore, we are also proposing in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(ii)
that the State agency shall allow a heating or cooling standard to households that receive or anticipate receiving
LIHEA in the next heating or cooling season. These households shall continue to be entitled to the standard until they
no longer receive or anticipate receiving LIHEA in the next heating or cooling season. The State agency would consult
with the household concerning the household's intention to apply for LIHEA, determine whether or not the household
received LIHEA for the previous season at the same address, and contact the LIHEA agency if necessary to determine
the availability of funds and the likelihood that the household will receive energy assistance. The case worker would
document the case file to support the decision to allow or deny use of the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(C) require that households incur recurring costs for heating or cooling
in order to qualify for a heating or cooling standard. The regulations are confusing in that they specify that the household
must be billed regularly, but, if the household is not billed regularly, it may use the standard between billing periods
if it is otherwise eligible to use the standard. Under this proposed revision, the regulatory provisions for billing
would not be needed. Entitlement to the heating or cooling standard would be based on anticipated expenses. Most households
that are responsible for paying heating or cooling expenses have these expenses on a recurring basis. Therefore,
we are proposing to remove the provisions regarding recurring costs from the regulations. We are also proposing to
remove the provisions in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(ii)(C) and 7 CFR 273.10(d)(6) regarding households that incur out-of-pocket
expenses for heating or cooling in excess of non-LIHEA energy assistance. These provisions would also be unnecessary
under the proposed revision of the regulations. Any household that receives LIHEA or incurs an out-of-pocket expense
for heating or cooling (except a household in public housing billed only for excess usage) would be entitled to an annualized
heating or cooling standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are also proposing a conforming amendment to 7 CFR 273.10(d)(3) to provide that standard utility allowances shall
be allowed in accordance with 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6). This change is necessary because the provisions allowing the averaging
of fluctuating expenses and the determination of entitlement to an annualized heating or cooling standard based
upon anticipated heating or cooling costs are exceptions to the provisions regarding billed expenses in 7 CFR 273.10(d)(2)
and anticipating expenses in 7 CFR 273.10(d)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Household option. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(vii) require State agencies to advise households
at the time of certification that, except for the telephone allowance, they may deduct their actual verified utility
costs or the standard allowance throughout the certification period. The State agency is also required to advise
households that they may switch between the use of actual utility costs and the standard at the time of recertification
and one additional time during each twelve-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies have pointed out that households may move from one residence to another more frequently than once a
year. Current policy is that the household's eligibility for the heating or cooling standard must be redetermined
at the time of the move. We have granted waivers to several State agencies to allow households to choose between actual
expenses or the standard when the household moves without having the choice count as a ``switch.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule proposes to include the provisions of current 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(vii) regarding the household option to
use a standard or actual costs in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also adds a provision requiring
State agencies to give households that move the option of actual expenses or a standard utility allowance based on
circumstances at the new address. When a household reports a move, it would be the State agency's responsibility to
redetermine the household's entitlement to a standard and give the household the opportunity to choose between actual
costs and the standard, if the household is entitled to the standard. Households that report a move would be granted
the standard on the same basis as applicants. If the household anticipates that it will receive LIHEA or incur out-of-pocket
heating or cooling expenses during the next heating or cooling season at the new address, it would be allowed use of
the standard. The household's choice of a standard or actual costs when it moves would not be considered a switch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(iii)(C) provide that the State agency may mandate use of the telephone allowance
even if actual telephone costs are higher. This provision was included in the regulations because of the concern of
State agencies that use of actual telephone costs would be extremely error-prone. We believe that use of an adequate
telephone standard increases the administrative efficiency of determining a household's excess shelter expense
without any significant adverse effect on households. Therefore, we are proposing to retain the provision of current
7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(v)(C) concerning the telephone allowance and incorporate it in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(iii).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Prorating standard utility allowances. Under section 5(e) of the Food Stamp Act, State agencies are required to
prorate a heating or cooling standard among households that live together and share the heating or cooling expense.
Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(d)(6)(viii) require State agencies to prorate a standard allowance among households
that live together and share utility expenses. It is not clear in the regulations whether proration is limited to the
heating or cooling standard or whether other standards, such as a telephone standard, must also be prorated among
the households contributing to the payment of the utility cost. Questions have arisen concerning proration of a heating
or cooling standard when one household pays for heat, for example, and another household pays for the water. We believe
it is equitable to prorate any standard among the households sharing the expense included in the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current provision indicates that if the State agency is unable to accurately determine the pro rata share of utility
costs paid by the parties, the State agency may use the actual utility costs paid by each household. The regulations
provide that under no circumstances shall the total amount of utility costs used to determine the amount of the deduction
exceed the total amount of actual utility costs for the residence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposed rule, households would be able to share a standard or claim actual verified costs. They would not
be allowed to use a combination of these methods in claiming a deduction for utility expenses. That is, State agencies
could not allow one household to claim a share of the utility standard and allow another household sharing the expense
to claim actual costs. We believe that allowing a combination of actual expenses and a share of the standard is burdensome
on State agencies.

Under this proposal, the total allowable deduction for the residence would not exceed actual costs or one standard
allowance. If one household pays all the utility expenses, that household would be entitled to the applicable standard
or could claim actual costs. The household that did not pay any utility costs would not be able to claim any actual utility
costs or any part of a standard. If one household pays for heat and the other household pays another expense, such as
water, a standard that includes the costs of heating and water would be prorated between the households according
to a method established by the State agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to provide in revised &sect;273.9(d)(6)(iv) of this rule that the State agency shall prorate any utility
standard among all parties incurring an expense covered by the standard or allow actual costs incurred by each party.
The State agency would be able to determine the proration method if a standard is prorated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the requirements of section 13971(b)(6) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, this rule provides that the increase
in the excess shelter expense deduction to $231 in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia ($402 in Alaska,
$330 in Hawaii, $280 in Guam, and $171 in the Virgin Islands) will be effective and must be implemented on July 1, 1994;
that the increase to $247 in the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia ($249 in Alaska, $353 in Hawaii, $300
in Guam, and $182 in the Virgin Islands) will be effective and must be implemented on October 1, 1995; and that removal
of the excess shelter deduction limit will be effective and must be implemented on January 1, 1997. The changes in provisions
for the homeless shelter estimate in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(i) will be effective July 1, 1994. State agencies are required
to adjust all cases on January 1, 1997 to reflect the deduction for all allowable excess shelter expenses. Restored
benefits must be provided to all households whose cases are not adjusted on the required implementation date. Variances
resulting from implementation of the final rule would be excluded from quality control consideration for 120 days
from the required implementation date in accordance with section 13951 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing that the changes in requirements for standard utility allowances made by this rule be effective and
implemented 120 days after publication of the final rule. The affected regulatory sections are: 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5)(ii)(C),
273.9(d)(6), 273.10(d)(3), 273.10(d)(6), and 273.12(a)(1)(i). State agencies would be required to adjust the
cases of ongoing households at the next recertification, at household request, or when the case is next reviewed,
whichever comes first. Variances resulting from implementation of the provisions of the final rule shall be excluded
from error analysis for 120 days from the required implementation date.

Developing and updating standard utility allowances. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A State agency may develop the following standard utility allowances (standards) to be used in place of actual costs
in determining a household's excess shelter deduction: a separate standard for each type of utility expense; a single
standard for all utilities that includes heating or cooling costs; a telephone standard; and a combined standard
that includes electricity, water, sewerage, and garbage or trash collection that is available only to households
that incur the costs of electricity and either water or sewerage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State agency shall submit proposed standards to FCS for approval. The State agency shall update the standards
annually and submit revised amounts to FCS for approval. State agencies shall submit methodologies used in developing
and updating standards to FCS for review every 3 years, when there is a change in the methodology, and upon a request
from FCS. State agencies may use a heating or cooling standard, a combined standard, and individual standards. However,
they shall not allow households the use of two standards that include the same expense. The State agency may elect to
use seasonal standards that include heating or cooling costs or an annual standard that does not have to be adjusted
seasonally. The State agency may vary the allowance by factors such as household size or geographical area. Only utility
costs identified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section shall be used in developing standards. The State agency
shall not use a reduced standard for households that receive assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance
Act (LIHEAA) of 1981. Households shall be allowed to use standards that include heating or cooling costs in accordance
with paragraphs (d)(6)(ii), (d)(6)(iii) and (d)(6)(iv) of this section. Households whose only utility expense
is for a telephone are entitled to only the separate telephone standard if one has been developed by the State agency.

Entitlement to a heating or cooling standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A standard with a heating or cooling component shall be made available to households that incur heating or cooling
expenses separately from their rent or mortgage or expect to incur such expenses in the next heating or cooling season,
except households in public housing units which have central utility meters and charge households only for excess
utility costs. Households that receive assistance under the LIHEAA but do not incur out-of-pocket heating or cooling
expenses are also entitled to a standard that includes a heating or cooling component on the same basis as households
that incur such costs. Households that receive other indirect energy assistance are entitled to a standard that includes
heating or cooling only if they incur out-of-pocket expenses for heating or cooling costs. Entitlement to an annualized
heating or cooling standard shall continue until the household no longer incurs or expects to incur a heating or cooling
expense or no longer receives or expects to receive a LIHEAA payment during the next heating or cooling season. If the
State agency elects to use seasonal standards, the State agency shall ensure that a standard is provided only to households
that incur or expect to incur an expense that would entitle the household to the standard or receive or expect to receive
a LIHEAA payment during the season covered by the standard.

The State agency shall advise a household at the time of certification and whenever it reports a move that it may deduct
verified actual utility costs (for any allowable expense identified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(C) of this section)
it incurs rather than the standard (except for the telephone standard) throughout the certification period if actual
expenses are more than the standard or the household is not eligible for the standard. The State agency may require
use of the telephone standard for the cost of basic telephone service even if actual costs are higher. The State agency
shall also inform the household that it may switch between use of actual utility costs and the standard at recertification
and one additional time during each twelve-month period.

costs of each household. The State agency shall determine the proration method if a standard is used.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In August 1991, the Board of Governors adopted the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (``Rules'') (56 FR 38048,
Aug. 9, 1991). The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) have also adopted the Rules (OCC, 56 FR 38024,
Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The
Board of Governors now proposes to amend one aspect of the Rules relating to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communications to clarify that the Rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The other
agencies are considering proposing a similar amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, &sect;263.9 of the Rules prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from
making an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication to the Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When
the Rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991)
explained that the proposed rule regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA
itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
outside the agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intra-agency 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended
decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel.
The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party
on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial
staff from seeking the amendment of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, neglected to mention the separation of functions concept explicitly,
and appeared to apply the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the
agency head, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested
in the proceeding'' on the other. The Board of Governors does not interpret this provision as limiting agency enforcement
staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however,
the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The Board of Governors did not intend this result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting
the prohibition on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States.

This proposed rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure
exclusively. Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised
regulation is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 series airplanes. This proposal
would require replacement of the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. This proposal is prompted by reports
of a binding condition in the clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to prevent reduced controllability of the airplane due to binding of a clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer
trim electric actuator.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently, the FAA has received reports from operators of Boeing Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 series
airplanes that the stabilizer trim wheel continued to turn after the switches for the stabilizer trim had been operated
and released. Investigation revealed that the clutch disk in the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator may
have caused the clutch to bind intermittently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, when the switches for the stabilizer trim are operated, the horizontal stabilizer trim electric actuator
turns and engages either the ``nose up'' or the ``nose down'' clutch, which causes the stabilizer to move. When the
switches for the stabilizer trim are released, the clutch disengages, and the actuator continues to turn until it
stops (coasts) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through deceleration. Under normal operating conditions, the stabilizer movement stops 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately after the clutch disengages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a binding clutch may cause the stabilizer to continue to move while the electric actuator coasts. The stabilizer
may move in the direction it was last commanded or it may reverse and move in the opposite direction. The direction depends
on which clutch disk is binding. This condition, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability of the
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
737&hyph;27A1191, Revision 1, dated November 3, 1994, which describes procedures for replacement of horizontal
stabilizer trim electric actuators, having part number (P/N) 10&hyph;62033&hyph;3, with a different model (P/N
10&hyph;62033&hyph;4) that eliminates the problems associated with binding of the clutch disk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require replacement of the electric actuator of the stabilizer trim with a different
model. The actions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously.

Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD. Under these circumstances, at least one operator appears to have incorrectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary, all airplanes identified in the applicability
provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such
a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA approval for an alternative
method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note
has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.]

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 1,448 Model 737&hyph;300, &hyph;400, and &hyph;500 series airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 590 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD,
that it would take approximately 4 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average
labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be approximately $600 per airplane. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $495,600, or $840 per airplane.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell
Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (military) series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes.
This proposal would require a visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs on the
ignition selector switch, and removal and correct installation of any improperly installed wire termination lugs.
This proposal would also require application of sealant to the wire termination lugs and the attachment screws. This
proposal is prompted by a report that, during the manufacturer's production flight testing, an abnormal engine start
valve open annunciation for engine No. 2 occurred and resulted in an uncontained failure of the engine starter. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent engine
components, and possible fire in the cowling, due to an uncontained failure of the engine starter.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has received a report that, during the manufacturer's production flight testing, an abnormal engine start
valve open annunciation for engine No. 2 occurred on a Model DC&hyph;9 series airplane. After the airplane landed,
inspection revealed that an uncontained failure of the engine starter on engine No. 2 had occurred. Investigation
revealed that a wire termination lug in the ignition selector switch was installed barrel down, and consequently,
contacted an adjacent terminal, causing an electrical short. This electrical short at the ignition selector switch
caused the engine start valve to stay open and resulted in an uncontained failure of the engine starter. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in damage to the engine cowling, damage to adjacent engine components, and possible
fire in the cowling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 24&hyph;121, dated February 24,
1992, which describes procedures for visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination lugs
on the ignition selector switch. This service bulletin also describes procedures for removal and proper installation
of the wire termination lug if it is found to be installed incorrectly. Additionally, the service bulletin describes
procedures for the application of a sealant to the termination lugs and attachment screws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to verify proper installation of the wire termination
lugs on the ignition selector switch. The proposed AD would also require removal of the wire termination lugs and reinstallation,
if they are installed improperly. Additionally, the proposed AD would require the application of a sealant to the
termination lugs and attachment screws. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously.

Note:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.]

There are approximately 1,954 Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 series airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88
airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 1,097 airplanes of U.S. registry would
be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. The cost of required parts would be nominal. Based on these
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $131,640 or $120 per airplane.

The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace to accommodate a new Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range
(VOR) runway 27 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) at Rantoul National Aviation Center Airport, Rantoul,
IL. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed for aircraft executing
the approach. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach
procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace to accommodate a VOR runway 27 SIAP, at Rantoul National Aviation Center Airport, Rantoul, IL. Controlled
airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect
of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions
from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined
area which would enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements.

The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated
by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently
in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains proposed amendments regarding the liability of lenders, sureties, or other third persons
for withholding taxes when those persons have supplied funds, either directly to employees or to or for the account
of an employer, for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the regulations under section 3505(b) with regard to the maximum liability of third parties
who supply funds for wages. The amendments also revise the regulations under section 3505 to increase the period of
limitations for collection after assessment of third-party liability, consistent with the statutory extension
of general limitation on collections the Internal Revenue Code, and to permit the third party to consent to extend
that period of limitations. The proposed amendments affect third parties paying or providing for wages.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking contains proposed changes to &sect;31.3505&hyph;1. Section 3505 of the Internal
Revenue Code (Code) was added by section 105(a) of the Federal Tax Lien Act of 1966, Pub. L. 89&hyph;719 (1966). Treasury
regulations were issued with an effective date of August 19, 1976 (TD 7430). Neither the Code section nor the regulations
has been amended since enactment or issuance, respectively. Since the issuance of the regulations, courts have consistently
determined the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds for wages in a manner that is contrary to the existing
regulations. Administrative difficulties have also arisen because the self-imposed period of limitations on collection
of these liabilities differs from the Code's general limitation on collections, and there is no provision in the regulations
to extend this period by agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments revise the regulations with regard to the maximum liability of third parties who supply funds
for wages to conform to judicial interpretation of the statute. To aid administration of this provision, the proposed
amendments also (i) increase the self-imposed period of limitations for collection of section 3505 liabilities,
consistent with the 1990 extension of the Code's general limitation on collections (See section 6502), from 6 years
to 10 years and (ii) add a provision allowing this period to be extended with the consent of the third party.

Explanation of Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3505(b), if a lender, surety, or other person (the lender) supplies funds to or for the account of an employer
for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of that employer, and the lender has actual notice or knowledge
(within the meaning of section 6323(i)(1)) that the employer does not intend or will not be able to make timely payment
or deposit of the required withholding taxes, the lender shall be liable to the United States in a sum equal to the taxes
(together with interest) that are not paid over to the United States by the employer with respect to those wages. The
lender's liability for withholding taxes, in lieu of the employer, is limited to an amount equal to 25 percent of the
amount of wages so supplied to or for the account of the employer. Code section 3505(b) (final sentence).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations provide that the 25-percent limitation applies only to the tax, and not the interest on that
tax, with the result that the lender could be held liable for more than 25 percent of the amount of funds it supplied.
The courts that have addressed this issue, however, have held that the 25-percent limitation on the amount of wages
supplied by a third party is an absolute cap with respect to the recovery of withholding taxes and prejudgment interest.

will continue to be computed in addition to any withholding tax liability, but only to an overall maximum of 25 percent
of the amount of the funds supplied by the lender.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revisions to the regulations also change the period of limitations for collection of the withholding
taxes and interest from six years to ten years. This revision will conform the period of limitations for the purposes
of section 3505 with the general rule on limitations on collection. See Internal Revenue Code section 6502, amended
by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, &sect;11317(a)(1) (1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;31.3505&hyph;1(d)(3) has been added to the regulations to provide for extensions of the period of
limitation for collection because, on occasion, the IRS or the lender requires additional time for compliance with
the regulation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 2, 1994, MSHA published a proposed rule (59 FR 54855) to establish uniform, due-process procedures for
decertifying persons who have been designated as MSHA-approved instructors and individuals certified or qualified
to perform certain mining related tasks under the applicable training and safety and health regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period was scheduled to close on January 6, 1995. The mining community has requested a 30-day extension
of the comment period because of anticipated holiday schedules and the desire of commenters to gather information
about States' decertification procedures. In response to this request, the Agency is extending the comment period
to February 6, 1995. All interested parties are encouraged to submit comments prior to that date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 6, 1994, EPA proposed standards to regulate the emissions of certain organic hazardous air pollutants from
aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities which are part of major sources under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act
as amended in 1990. The period for receiving public comment on the proposed rule ended on September 15, 1994. This action
announces the reopening of the comment period to take comments on several amendments to the proposed rulemaking and
other issues raised during the original comment period; clarification of the intent of a proposed requirement; and
a correction of a typographical error.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 6, 1994 (59 FR 29216), national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for the aerospace manufacturing
and rework source category were proposed. Since that time, the EPA has received information on several aspects of
the proposed rule which has led to the amendments being proposed in this notice for the following sections of the proposed
subpart GG of 40 CFR part 63: &sect;&sect;63.742, 63.745, 63.747, 63.749, 63.751, and 63.752. These sections deal
with definitions, standards for primer and topcoat application operations, standards for chemical milling maskant
application operations, compliance determinations, monitoring requirements, and recordkeeping requirements,
respectively, for the NESHAP for aerospace manufacturing and rework facilities. This notice announces the reopening
of the comment period for the aerospace NESHAP. However, only comments limited to the subjects listed below will be
considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Correction of a typographical error regarding a request for comments for commercial exterior primers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proposal of a more stringent inorganic HAP emission control requirement for new primer and topcoat application
operations and proposal of definition of high efficiency particulate air filter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Proposal to eliminate the exemption for chemical milling maskant application operations for use with Type I chemical
milling etchants;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Clarification of the intent of the proposed requirement for control devices used to control emissions from coating
application operations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Proposal of reduced recordkeeping requirements to encourage the use of a low VOC primer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Request for comment on depainting for private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Request for comment on use and efficiency of control devices for depainting operations using HAP-containing
chemicals; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Request for comment on determining the appropriate length of the rolling material balance period for liquid-liquid
material balances for carbon adsorbers used as control devices for solvent recovery systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These actions are further discussed in Part III of this preamble.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 59 FR 29217, the EPA traditionally issues a draft CTG containing
recommended control levels for public comment. Rather than issue a separate draft CTG in this case, the EPA used the
notice of proposed rulemaking to request public comment on draft best available control measures (BACM), which is
the same as the proposed maximum achievable control technology (MACT) for coatings and solvents. Comments on the
proposed rule and on the proposed amendments in this document will also be considered in formulating a final BACM.

II. Summary of and Rationale for Changes to the Proposed Rule and Request for Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Correction: Request for Comments on Commercial Exterior Primers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section II.B.2.a of the preamble to the proposed rule requested comments concerning whether the proposed organic
HAP and VOC limits for commercial exterior topcoats represents demonstrated technology. This section should have
referenced commercial exterior primers rather than topcoats. Consequently, the specific paragraph in this section
(see 59 FR 29224, middle column) should read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has received information indicating that the organic HAP and VOC content limits for primers do not represent
demonstrated technology for exterior commercial primers. Consequently, the EPA is soliciting comments on whether
a separate category should be developed for exterior commercial primers with organic HAP and VOC content levels higher
than the proposed levels for primers. These comments should provide a technical justification for a higher limit,
including why currently available commercial primers cannot be used by all sources.

B. Amendment: New Source Requirements for Inorganic HAP Emissions from Coating Operations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has received information that at least one facility is controlling inorganic HAP emissions from coating operations
to a greater degree than that required in the proposed rule. This facility is using high efficiency particulate air
(HEPA) filters in addition to the filtration methods required in the proposed rule. Consequently, the EPA is proposing
that &sect;63.745 require new primer and topcoat application operations to use HEPA filters in addition to the requirements
specified in the rule proposed on June 6, 1994. Finally, the EPA is proposing that these sources keep records of documentation
supplied by the filter manufacturer that the filter being used meets the HEPA filter requirements specified in the
definition in &sect;63.742 being proposed by this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Amendment: Inclusion of Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operations for Use With Type I Chemical Milling
Etchants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed on June 6, 1994, the rule would apply only to those chemical milling maskant application operations in
which Type II chemical milling etchants are subsequently used. This was based on information the EPA received showing
that no facilities had implemented controls (either low VOC product substitutions or control devices) on chemical
milling maskant application operations for use with Type I chemical milling etchants. Since proposal, the EPA has
received comment that there is at least one chemical milling maskant application operation for use with Type I chemical
milling etchants (which are not currently covered in the proposed rule) with reduced organic HAP and VOC content levels.
The information supplied to the EPA, however, did not detail the applicability of this chemical milling maskant to
all Type I etchant operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MACT floor for chemical milling maskant application operations, as determined by the average of the best performing
12 percent of sources for which the EPA had emission information, included the use of control devices (e.g., carbon
adsorbers) as well as low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskants. As mentioned above, the applicability
of the low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling maskant for which the EPA received comment is unknown. However,
the use of the same control device technology as used for Type II chemical milling operations is applicable to Type
I chemical milling operations. Consequently, the EPA is proposing to eliminate the exemption in &sect;63.747 for
chemical milling maskants used with Type I etchants and require them to meet the same requirements as chemical milling
maskants for use with Type II etchants. This will allow the use of any low organic HAP and VOC content chemical milling
maskant that meets the 160 grams per liter (1.3 pounds per gallon) organic HAP and VOC content limits or the use of control
devices as specified in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Amendment: Requirement for the Capture of All Emissions by Control Devices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule required that whenever a control device is used to meet the emission limitations specified, the
owner or operator must meet two provisions in order to demonstrate compliance. The first is that the overall control
efficiency, taking into account capture and control efficiency, must be at least 81 percent. The second provision,
as specified in &sect;&sect;63.745(c)(1), 63.747(d)(1), 63.749(d)(4)(ii)(A), and 63.749(g)(3)(ii)(A) of the
proposed rule, requires that all of the emissions from the respective operations be captured and controlled by the
control device. In addition, the latter two paragraphs specify that all emissions must be controlled other than ``incidental
emissions that may escape the capture system.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed these provisions based on comments that have been received concerning their enforceability.
Based on this review, the EPA has concluded that the provision specifying an overall control efficiency is adequate
to ensure application of MACT. The additional language only added confusion to the proposed rule without any added
environmental benefit. The EPA, therefore, is deleting from the proposed rule the four paragraphs referenced above
concerning the capture of all emissions from coating operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Amendment: Reduced Recordkeeping Requirements for Low Organic HAP and VOC Content Primer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has received information that a low organic HAP and VOC content (approximately 250 grams VOC per liter (2.1
pounds per gallon) less water and exempt solvents) military waterborne primer has been qualified according to military
specification MIL&hyph;P&hyph;85582A, Type I, Class II. While this primer may not represent demonstrated technology
for all types of uses, the EPA wishes to encourage the use of low organic HAP and VOC content coatings. Consequently,
the EPA is proposing to amend the recordkeeping requirements of &sect;63.752 of the proposed rule to require that
only annual purchasing records be maintained on the use of any primer that contains a maximum of 250 grams organic HAP
per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water as applied and 250 grams VOC per liter (2.1 pounds per gallon) less water
and exempt solvents as applied. This significantly reduces the recordkeeping from the monthly records required
for coatings with higher organic HAP and VOC contents.

F. Request for Comments: Depainting Requirements for Private, Corporate, and Small Commuter Aircraft
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has received comments that the proposed standards for depainting do not represent demonstrated technology
for private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft. Specifically, the commenters stated that depainting of these
aircraft cannot be accomplished through the use of non-HAP chemical strippers or media blasting methods. One commenter
also stated that the physical characteristics of the coatings typically used on the exterior of private and corporate
aircraft cannot be removed by the non-HAP chemical strippers currently on the market. Another comment concerned
the use of a control device, such as carbon absorbers followed by a catalytic incinerator, to reduce emissions from
depainting operations where HAP-containing chemical strippers are used as an alternative means of compliance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to obtain additional and more specific information on this sector of the aerospace rework industry, the EPA
is requesting data and information on the following specific issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. One commenter stated that to achieve the finish quality demanded by private and corporate aircraft purchasers,
the aircraft manufacturers are using coatings that have a cross-linked polymer structure. According to the commenter,
the structure of these coatings does not allow the non-HAP chemical strippers to penetrate the coating in order to
break the bond between the coating and substrate. The EPA requests information on whether non-HAP chemical strippers
have been shown to be effective on this type of coating. Commenters are requested to provide as many details as possible
of non-HAP chemical depainting processes such as type and number of aircraft depainted, specific type of primer and
topcoats removed, VOC content (as applied, less water and exempt solvents) of the primer and topcoat removed, and
method of disposal of the waste stripper. Information on the cross-linked polymer coatings (e.g., VOC content, manufacturer)
and its finish characteristics are also requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the EPA requests comments on whether coatings other than cross-linked polymers can be used on private
and corporate aircraft. Information requested includes: whether substitute coatings can be used to achieve similar
finishes; whether these other coatings are easier to strip; VOC content (as applies, less water and exempt solvents)
of these other coatings; application methods; whether changing coatings or not painting aircraft would affect aircraft
safety; and the economic impacts of changing coatings or not painting aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Another commenter focused on the thin exterior skin panels of private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft.
The commenter said that since weight is a critical parameter for these aircraft, very thin exterior skin panels, that
are very susceptible to damage from blast depainting methods, are typically used. The commenter states that as a consequence,
no rework facilities are currently using blast depainting methods on these aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information on this topic is requested from any facility that has evaluated or is currently using any blast depainting
method or non-chemical means to remove coatings from the exterior of private, corporate, or small commuter aircraft.
Specifically, the information should document both successful and unsuccessful applications of blast or mechanical
depainting methods for these aircraft, or any other aircraft with similarly thin exterior skin panels. Any information
on the generation and control of emissions from blast or mechanical depainting operations (of any type of aircraft)
would also be beneficial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Request for Comment: Control Devices for Depainting Operations Using HAP-Containing Chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter recommended that conventional chemical strippers (containing HAPs) be allowed when emissions
are reduced through the use of a control device. The commenter stated that a combination of a carbon adsorber and catalytic
incinerator can achieve greater than 99 percent removal efficiency, and would be essentially equal to the depainting
standard of no HAP emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information submitted on this topic should address the feasibility of installing such a control system, including
cost and ability to achieve greater than 99 percent removal efficiency on a dilute airstream. Also, since some portion
of the volatile HAP content of conventional strippers will be retained in the waste sludge produced from the operation,
commenters should detail the ultimate fate of emissions from the volatile HAPs in the waste stream. For example, a
conventional waste treatment system may aerate the waste stream as an initial processing step, emitting the volatile
HAPs at that point. However, other waste treatment methods may destroy HAPs before the aeration step. Comments are
also requested on whether a standard allowing the use of control devices to reduce emissions from depainting operations
should apply only to the depainting of private, corporate, and small commuter aircraft, or if it should apply to military
and commercial aircraft as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Request for Comment: Appropriate Length of Rolling Material Balance Period for Liquid-Liquid Material Balances
for Carbon Adsorbers Used as Control Devices on Solvent Recovery Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA proposed Method 309, ``Method to Determine Length of Rolling Period for Liquid/Liquid Material Balance Method''
to determine the length of the rolling material balance period for the liquid-liquid material balance for carbon
adsorbers used as control devices on solvent recovery systems. Several comments have been received concerning whether
Method 309 is the most appropriate method for the aerospace industry in all instances. Therefore, the EPA is requesting
comment on alternatives to Method 309. Information in support of alternatives to Method 309 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include how the length of the balance period is determined; discussions of operations that make an alternate
determination of length appropriate; discussions concerning how compliance is indicated and ensured with the alternative
determination; whether the alternative determination has been approved by state or local air pollution agencies
in permits or other documents; and why Method 309 does not allow for the alternative determination.

A. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The changes detailed in this notice will have the following effects on the information collection burden (recordkeeping,
reporting, and monitoring requirements) of the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The request for comments concerning commercial exterior primers does not affect the information collection
burden of the proposed rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) New sources would be required to use HEPA filter and to maintain records documenting that the filters used meet
the requirements of HEPA filters, but this would not significantly increase the recordkeeping burden; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The inclusion of Type I chemical milling maskants would require the same recordkeeping and reporting requirements
as specified for Type II chemical milling maskants. Since the EPA has no information on which to base an estimate of
the number of facilities currently using Type I chemical milling etchants, the magnitude of the effect on the information
collection burden cannot be made; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The deletion of the requirement to capture and control all of the emissions from coating operations does not affect
the information collection burden of the proposed rule; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Reducing the recordkeeping requirements for low organic HAP and VOC content primers will result in a decrease
in the information collection requirements for those facilities that use these primers. However, the EPA has no information
on which to base an estimate of the number of facilities that will use the low organic HAP and VOC content primers. Therefore,
the magnitude of the effect on the information collection request burden cannot be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the effect on the information collection burden cannot be completely quantified, the EPA believes that
it will not significantly change. Therefore, the Information Collection Request document developed for the proposed
rule has not been revised.

I. Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required under title V of the Clean Air Act (``the Act'') as amended (1990), EPA has promulgated rules that define
the minimum elements of an approvable state operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures
by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of state operating permits programs (see 57 FR 32250
(July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at 40 CFR part 70. Title V requires states to develop and submit to EPA, by
November 15, 1993, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other
sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act requires that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within 1 year after receiving the submittal. The
EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act, which outlines criteria for approval or disapproval.
Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim
approval for a period of up to 2 years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by 2 years after the November 15, 1993 date,
or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Analysis of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The analysis contained in this notice focuses on specific elements of Ventura's title V operating permits program
that must be corrected to meet the minimum requirements of 40 CFR part 70. The full program submittal, the Technical
Support Document (TSD), which contains a detailed analysis of the submittal, and other relevant materials are available
for inspection as part of the public docket. The docket may be viewed during regular business hours at the address listed
above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Title V Program Support Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ventura's title V program was submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) on November 16, 1993. Additional
material was submitted on December 6, 1993. The submittal was found to be administratively complete on February 4,
1994. The Governor's letter requesting source category-limited interim approval, California enabling legislation,
and Attorney General's legal opinion were submitted by CARB for all districts in California and therefore were not
included separately in Ventura's submittal. The Ventura submission does contain a complete program description,
District implementing and supporting regulations, and all other program documentation required by &sect;70.4.
An implementation agreement is currently being developed between Ventura and EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Title V Operating Permit Regulations and Program Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ventura's regulations that implement part 70 include Rule 8, Access to Facilities; Rule 15, Standards for Permit
Issuance; Rule 15.1, Sampling and Testing Facilities; Rule 23, Exemption from Permit; Rule 26.1, New Source Review
(definitions of ``modified emissions unit,'' ``new emissions unit,'' and ``stationary source'' only); Rule 29,
Conditions on Permits (paragraph C only); Rule 33, Part 70 Permits; and Rule 42, Permit Fees. These rules, in conjunction
with authorities granted under California State law, substantially meet the requirements of 40 CFR part 70, sections
70.2 and 70.3 for applicability; sections 70.4, 70.5, and 70.6 for permit content, including operational flexibility;
section 70.7 for public participation and minor permit modifications; section 70.5 for complete application forms;
and section 70.11 for enforcement authority. Although the regulations substantially meet part 70 requirements,
there are several program deficiencies that are outlined under section II.B. below as interim approval issues and
further described in the Technical Support Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Variances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ventura County APCD has the authority to issue a variance from requirements (except the requirement to obtain a permit
to construct or operate)imposed by state and local law. See California HSC sections 42350&hyph;42364 and Ventura
Regulation VII. In the opinion submitted with California operating permit programs, California's Attorney General
states that ``[t]he variance process is not part of the Title V permitting process and does not affect Federal enforcement
for violations of the requirements set forth in a Title V permit.'' (Emphasis in original.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA regards the State and District variance provisions as wholly external to the program submitted for approval
under part 70 and consequently is proposing to take no action on these provisions of state and local law. The EPA has
no authority to approve provisions of state law that are inconsistent with the CAA. The EPA does not recognize the ability
of a permitting authority to grant relief from the duty to comply with a federally enforceable part 70 permit, except
where such relief is granted through procedures allowed by part 70. A part 70 permit may be issued or revised (consistent
with part 70 permitting procedures), to incorporate those terms of a variance that are consistent with applicable
requirements. A part 70 permit may also incorporate, via part 70 permit issuance or revision procedures, the schedule
of compliance set forth in a variance. However, EPA reserves the right to pursue enforcement of applicable requirements
notwithstanding the existence of a compliance schedule in a permit to operate. This is consistent with 40 CFR 70.5(c)(8)(iii)(C),
which states that a schedule of compliance ``shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with,
the applicable requirements on which it is based.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permit content.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is specifically approving the General part 70 Permit Conditions that were submitted as part of Ventura's part
70 program. Any modifications to these general conditions must be approved by EPA. Failure to include these conditions
in part 70 permits will be cause for EPA to object to a District operating permit. See &sect;70.8(c)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ventura's permit content rule (Rule 33.3) does not include the level of detail regarding periodic monitoring found
in &sect;70.6(a)(3)(i)(B). Paragraphs A.1. and A.3. of Rule 33 more generally address the requirements for periodic
monitoring. These paragraphs provide that operating permits issued pursuant to this rule will assure compliance
with all applicable requirements and will include conditions establishing all applicable emissions monitoring
and analysis procedures etc., required under all applicable requirements. Although the rule does not explicitly
state that the periodic monitoring or testing will be ``sufficient to yield reliable data from the relevant time period
that are representative of the source's compliance period&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*,'' the more general language
cited above is consistent with this requirement. Should Ventura draft a permit that does not meet the requirements
of &sect;70.6(a)(3)(i)(B), EPA will exercise its authority under &sect;70.8(c)(1) and will object to the permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Insignificant activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 70.4(b)(2) requires states to include in their part 70 programs any criteria used to determine insignificant
activities or emission levels for the purposes of determining complete applications. Section 70.5(c) states that
an application for a part 70 permit may not omit information needed to determine the applicability of, or to impose,
any applicable requirement, or to evaluate appropriate fee amounts. Section 70.5(c) also states that EPA may approve,
as part of a state program, a list of insignificant activities and emissions levels which need not be included in permit
applications. Under part 70, a state must request and EPA must approve as part of that state's program any activity
or emission level that the state wishes to consider insignificant. Part 70, however, does not establish appropriate
emission levels for insignificant activities, relying instead on a case-by-case determination of appropriate
levels based on the particular circumstances of part 70 program under review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ventura provided its current permit exemption list as its list of insignificant activities. Because EPA was provided
no criteria or information on the level of emissions of activities on Ventura's exemptions list and no demonstration
that these activities are not likely to be subject to an applicable requirement, EPA cannot propose full approval
of the list as the basis for determining insignificant activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For other state programs, EPA has proposed to accept, as sufficient for full approval, emission levels for insignificant
activities of 2 tons per year for criteria pollutants and the lesser of 1000 pounds per year, section 112(g) de minimis
levels, or other title I significant modification levels for HAPs and other toxics (40 CFR 52.21(b)(23)(i)). EPA
believes that these levels are sufficiently below applicability thresholds for many applicable requirements to
assure that no unit potentially subject to an applicable requirement is left off a title V application and are consistent
with current permitting thresholds in Ventura County. EPA is requesting comment on the appropriateness of these
emission levels for determining insignificant activities in Ventura County. This request for comment is not intended
to restrict the ability of the District to propose and EPA to approve other emission levels if the District demonstrates
that such alternative emission levels are insignificant compared to the level of emissions from and types of units
that are permitted or subject to applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of title I modification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ventura's definition of ``title I modification'' does not include changes reviewed under a minor source preconstruction
review program (``minor NSR changes''). The EPA is currently in the process of determining the proper definition
of that phrase. As further explained below, EPA has solicited public comment on whether the phrase ``modification
under any provision of title I of the Act'' in 40 CFR 70.7(e)(2)(i)(A)(5) should be interpreted to mean literally any
change at a source that would trigger permitting authority review under regulations approved or promulgated under
title I of the Act. This would include state preconstruction review programs approved by EPA as part of the State Implementation
Plan under section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 29, 1994, EPA proposed revisions to the interim approval criteria in 40 CFR 70.4(d) to, among other things,
allow state programs with a more narrow definition of ``title I modifications'' to receive interim approval (59 FR
44572). The Agency explained its view that the better reading of ``title I modifications'' includes minor NSR and
pre&hyph;1990 NESHAP requirements, and solicited public comment on the proper interpretation of that term (59 FR
44573). The Agency stated that if, after considering the public comments, it continued to believe that the phrase
``title I modifications'' should be interpreted as including minor NSR changes, it would revise the interim approval
criteria as needed to allow states with a narrower definition to be eligible for interim approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA hopes to finalize its rulemaking revising the interim approval criteria under 40 CFR 70.4(d) expeditiously.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If EPA establishes in its rulemaking that the definition of ``title I modifications'' can be interpreted to exclude
changes reviewed under minor NSR programs, Ventura's definition of ``title I modification'' would be fully consistent
with part 70. Conversely, if EPA establishes through the rulemaking that the definition must include changes reviewed
under minor NSR, Ventura's definition of ``title I modifications'' will become a basis for interim approval. If the
definition becomes a basis for interim approval as a result of EPA's rulemaking, Ventura would be required to revise
its definition to conform to the requirements of part 70.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Publication of the proposed interim approval criteria revisions was delayed until August 29, 1994, and EPA received
several requests to extend the public comment period until November 27, 1994. Given the importance of the issues in
that rulemaking to states, sources and the public, but mindful of the need to take action quickly, EPA agreed to extend
the comment period until October 28, 1994 (see 59 FR 52122 (October 14, 1994)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, today's proposed approval does not identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ventura's definition of ``title I modification'' as necessary grounds for either interim approval or disapproval.
Again, although EPA has reasons for believing that the better interpretation of ``title I modifications'' is the
broader one, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to determine whether this is a program deficiency until EPA
completes its rulemaking on this issue.

3. Permit Fee Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 502(b)(3) of the Act requires that each permitting authority collect fees sufficient to cover all reasonable
direct and indirect costs required to develop and administer its title V operating permits program. Each title V program
submittal must contain either a detailed demonstration of fee adequacy or a demonstration that aggregate fees collected
from title V sources meet or exceed $25 per ton of emissions per year (adjusted from 1989 by the Consumer Price Index
(CPI)). The $25 per ton amount is presumed, for program approval, to be sufficient to cover all reasonable program
costs and is thus referred to as the ``presumptive minimum'' (&sect;70.9(b)(2)(i)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ventura has opted to make a presumptive minimum fee demonstration. Ventura's existing fee schedule requires title
V facilities to pay an average of $65.34 per ton in annual renewal fees. Ventura calculated its fee level at $65.34 per
ton by adding up the annual renewal fees paid by sources identified as title V facilities ($1,192,780), and dividing
that number by the permitted emissions (tons per year of regulated air pollutants) of those facilities (18,254.2
tons per year). The numbers in the calculation underestimate fee revenues and overestimate actual emissions, and
therefore result in a conservative calculation of the fees collected per ton of pollutant. Ventura's fee demonstration
shows that currently assessed renewal fees will be adequate to cover program costs for the next four years. For more
information, see section VI of Ventura's Title V Operating Permit Program Description, available in the docket.

4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Authority and commitments for section 112 implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ventura has demonstrated in its title V program submittal adequate legal authority to implement and enforce all section
112 requirements through the title V permit. This legal authority is contained in the State of California enabling
legislation and in regulatory provisions defining ``federally enforceable requirements'' and stating that the
permit must incorporate all applicable requirements. EPA has determined that this legal authority is sufficient
to allow Ventura to issue permits that assure compliance with all section 112 requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is interpreting the above legal authority to mean that Ventura is able to carry out all section 112 activities.
For further rationale on this interpretation, please refer to the Technical Support Document accompanying this
rulemaking and the April 13, 1993 guidance memorandum titled ``Title V Program Approval Criteria for Section 112
Activities,'' signed by John Seitz, Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, U.S. EPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. District preconstruction permit program to implement 112(g).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a condition of approval of the part 70 program, Ventura is required to implement section 112(g) of the Act from the
effective date of the part 70 program. Imposition of case&hyph;by&hyph;case determinations of MACT or offsets under
section 112(g) will require the use of a mechanism for establishing federally enforceable restrictions on a source-specific
basis. The EPA is proposing to approve Ventura's preconstruction permitting program found in Ventura's Regulation
II under the authority of title V and part 70 solely for the purpose of implementing section 112(g) during the transition
period between title V approval and adoption of a District rule implementing EPA's section 112(g) regulations. EPA
believes this approval is necessary so that Ventura has a mechanism in place to establish federally enforceable restrictions
for section 112(g) purposes from the date of part 70 approval. Although section 112(l) generally provides the authority
for approval of state air toxics programs, title V and section 112(g) provide authority for this limited approval
because of the direct linkage between implementation of section 112(g) and title V. The scope of this approval is narrowly
limited to section 112(g), and does not confer or imply approval for purposes of any other provision under the Act.
If Ventura does not wish to implement section 112(g) through its preconstruction permit program and can demonstrate
that an alternative means of implementing section 112(g) exists, the EPA may, in the final action approving Ventura's
part 70 program, approve the alternative instead.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval is for an interim period only, until such time as the District is able to adopt regulations consistent
with any regulations promulgated by EPA to implement section 112(g). Accordingly, EPA is proposing to limit the duration
of this approval to a reasonable time following promulgation of section 112(g) regulations so that Ventura, acting
expeditiously, will be able to adopt regulations consistent with the section 112(g) regulations. The EPA is proposing
here to limit the duration of this approval to 12 months following promulgation by EPA of section 112(g) regulations.
Comment is solicited on whether 12 months is an appropriate period considering Ventura's procedures for adoption
of regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Requirements for approval, specified in 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval
of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as promulgated by EPA as they apply to part 70 sources. Section
112(l)(5) requires that the District's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation,
and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, the EPA is also proposing
to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and 40 CFR 63.91 of Ventura's program for receiving delegation of section
112 standards that are unchanged from the Federal standards as promulgated. Ventura has informed EPA that it intends
to accept delegation of section 112 standards through automatic delegation, as provided for by sections 39658 and
42301.10 of the California Health and Safety Code. The details of this delegation mechanism will be set forth in an
Implementation Agreement between Ventura and EPA, expected to be completed prior to approval of Ventura's section
112(l) program for straight delegations. This program applies to both existing and future standards but is limited
to sources covered by the part 70 program.

d. Commitments for title IV implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a letter dated May 26, 1994, Ventura's Air Pollution Control Officer (APCO) committed to propose to the District
governing board (Board), a complete acid rain program, with sufficient time to submit the program to EPA by January
1, 1995. The APCO stated his intent to propose to the Board that they incorporate by reference the relevant provisions
of part 72. The letter further indicates that the incorporation by reference will automatically incorporate Federal
revisions to part 72.

B. Proposed Interim Approval and Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by Ventura County APCD on
December 6, 1993. If EPA were to finalize this proposed interim approval, it would extend for two years following the
effective date of final interim approval, and could not be renewed. During the interim approval period, Ventura would
be protected from sanctions, and EPA would not be obligated to promulgate, administer and enforce a Federal permits
program for the District. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to
part 70, and the 1-year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon the effective
date of interim approval, as does the 3-year time period for processing the initial permit applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following final interim approval, if Ventura failed to submit a complete corrective program for full approval by
the date 6 months before expiration of the interim approval, EPA would start an 18-month clock for mandatory sanctions.
If the District then failed to submit a corrective program that EPA found complete before the expiration of that 18-month
period, EPA would be required to apply one of the sanctions in section 179(b) of the Act, which would remain in effect
until EPA determined that Ventura had corrected the deficiency by submitting a complete corrective program. Moreover,
if the Administrator found a lack of good faith on the part of the the District, both sanctions under section 179(b)
would apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until the Administrator determined that the District had
come into compliance. In any case, if, six months after application of the first sanction, the District still had not
submitted a corrective program that EPA found complete, a second sanction would be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If, following final interim approval, EPA were to disapprove Ventura's complete corrective program, EPA would be
required to apply one of the section 179(b) sanctions on the date 18 months after the effective date of the disapproval,
unless prior to that date the District had submitted a revised program and EPA had determined that it corrected the
deficiencies that prompted the disapproval. Moreover, if the Administrator found a lack of good faith on the part
of the District, both sanctions under section 179(b) would apply after the expiration of the 18-month period until
the Administrator determined that the District had come into compliance. In all cases, if, six months after EPA applied
the first sanction, Ventura had not submitted a revised program that EPA had determined corrected the deficiencies
that prompted disapproval, a second sanction would be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, discretionary sanctions may be applied where warranted any time after the end of an interim approval
period if a state or district has not timely submitted a complete corrective program or EPA has disapproved a submitted
corrective program. Moreover, if EPA has not granted full approval to a title V operating permits program by the expiration
of an interim approval and that expiration occurs after November 15, 1995, EPA must promulgate, administer and enforce
a Federal permits program for that state of district upon interim approval expiration.

1. Ventura's Title V Operating Permits Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If interim approval is granted, Ventura must make the following changes to receive full approval: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Insignificant activities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rules 33.2 and 23 provide the framework for Ventura's insignificant activities provisions. For its program to be
fully approvable, Ventura must provide a demonstration that activities that are exempt from part 70 permitting are
truly insignificant and are not likely to be subject to an applicable requirement. Alternatively, the District may
restrict the exemptions to activities that are not likely to be subject to an applicable requirement and emit less
than District-established emission levels. The District should establish separate emission levels for HAPs and
for other regulated pollutants and demonstrate that these emission levels are insignificant compared to the level
of emissions from and type of units that are required to be permitted or subject to applicable requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Revision process for significant changes to monitoring terms and conditions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The definitions of ``minor permit modification'' and ``significant part 70 permit modification'' in Rule 33.1 must
be revised to ensure that significant changes to existing monitoring permit terms or conditions are processed as
significant permit modifications. See &sect;70.7(e)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Operation of modifications prior to permit revision.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except in the case when a federally enforceable permit condition would prohibit it, Ventura's Rule 33.9 A.1. allows
sources to make significant modifications prior to receiving a part 70 permit revision. In order to be consistent
with part 70, Ventura must revise its rule so that the only changes that may be operated prior to receiving a part 70 permit
revision are those modifications subject to section 112(g) and title I, parts C and D of the Act, and that are not prohibited
by the existing part 70 permit. Under part 70, if a proposed change does not meet these criteria, the source may not make
the change until the permitting authority has revised the source's part 70 permit. See &sect;70.5(a)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 d. Public notice.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Revise Rule 33.7 B. to include notice ``by other means if necessary to assure adequate notice to the affected public.''
See &sect;70.7(h)(1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. Permit content.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ventura's permit content requirements are found in Rules 33.3 and 33.9. These regulatory provisions adequately
address nearly all of the part 70 requirements. Certain elements (e.g. &sect;&sect;70.6(a)(3)(ii)(B), 70.6(a)(6)(i)),
are more fully detailed in the General Part 70 Permit conditions, which were submitted in appendix B.2.b. of Ventura's
part 70 program submittal. Ventura must establish a binding requirement that the General Part 70 Permit Conditions
will be included in all part 70 permits. Ventura may accomplish this by modifying its regulation to reference the general
conditions that were submitted and approved by EPA, or by more fully addressing the conditions within the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
f. Recordkeeping requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Revise Rule 33.3 permit content requirement to provide adequate specificity with regard to the applicable recordkeeping
requirements. See &sect;70.6(a)(3)(C)(ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
g. Emissions trading under applicable requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Add emissions trading provisions consistent with &sect;70.6(a)(10), which require that trading must be allowed
where an applicable requirement provides for trading increases and decreases without a case-by-case approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
h. Compliance schedule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Rule 33.3 B.2., which requires that a schedule of compliance be included in the permit, does not create an explicit
link with 33.9 B.4., which details the contents of a compliance schedule. Revise Rule 33.3 permit content requirements
to ensure that all elements of the compliance schedule under &sect;70.5(c) are incorporated into the permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i. EPA Notification of operational flexibility changes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 33.5 D. must be revised to incorporate EPA notification of changes made under the operational flexibility provisions,
either by providing for it within the regulation, or by making the general permit conditions, which do specify EPA
notification, required elements of each permit. See &sect;70.4(b)(14)(ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. California Enabling Legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Legislative source category limited interim approval issue.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because California state law currently exempts agricultural production sources from permit requirements, the
California Air Resources Board has requested source category limited interim approval for all California districts.
EPA is proposing to grant source category limited interim approval to the operating permits program submitted by
the California Air Resources Board on behalf of Ventura County on December 6, 1993. In order for this program to receive
full approval (and to avoid a disapproval upon the expiration of this interim approval), the California Legislature
must revise the Health and Safety Code to eliminate the exemption of agricultural production sources from the requirement
to obtain a permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above described program and legislative deficiencies must be corrected before Ventura can receive full program
approval. For additional information, please refer to the TSD, which contains a detailed analysis of Ventura's operating
permits program and California's enabling legislation.

III. Administrative Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Request for Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed interim approval. Copies of Ventura's submittal and
other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional
Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered
by, EPA in the development of this proposed interim approval. The principal purposes of the docket are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate
in the approval process; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review. The EPA will consider any comments received by [insert date 30
days after date of publication].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA's actions under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply address operating permits
programs submitted to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 70. Because this action does not impose any new requirements,
it does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;31, contains three provisions which will
make it easier for individuals to register to vote in elections for Federal office. These include: (1) the simultaneous
application for or renewal of drivers licenses and voter registration (the motor voter part of the bill); (2) the adoption
and use of a ``mail'' application form for voter registration; and (3) the designation of State voter registration
agencies, including among others, all offices in a State that provide ``public assistance'' and ``State-funded
programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined in the conference report, the term ``public assistance agencies'' include ``*&blank;*&blank;* those
State agencies in each State that administer or provide services under the food stamp, Medicaid, the Women, Infants
and Children (WIC) and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs''. H. Rep. No. 103&hyph;66 (1993),
p. 19.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to section 7(a)(4) of the NVRA, public assistance offices shall: distribute mail voter registration forms;
provide assistance in forms completion; and provide a service to accept completed forms and to transmit them to appropriate
authorities. These services are to be available at the time of application, recertification, or renewal or when a
change in address is reported. The NVRA also contains provisions addressing how applicants and recipients of public
assistance are to be informed of their right to request or decline in this assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(5) of the NVRA indicates that these offices shall not: seek to influence a party preference; display
party-affiliated materials; discourage registration; or imply in any way that the availability of services or benefits
is dependent upon a decision to register or not to register to vote.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulatory provisions at 45 CFR 205.50(a)(4) and 42 CFR 431.307 (a)(2), (b), and (c) result in barring the
distribution of voter registration materials to AFDC and Medicaid applicants recipients. Enactment of the NVRA
mandates that State and local public assistance offices conduct such activities. In order to comply with these statutory
requirements, we propose to amend 45 CFR 205.50 and 42 CFR 431.307 to remove the bar from the States subject to NVRA.
The bar, however, would continue to apply to States that are exempt from NVRA. States that permit voter registration
at polling places (since March 11, 1993 or pursuant to State law enacted on or before that date) or States with no voter
registration requirements for any voter in the state with respect to an election for Federal office (since March 11,
1993) are exempt from NVRA requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
State agencies responsible for the administration of the AFDC and Medicaid programs have already been advised of
the availability of Federal financial participation (FFP) necessary to conduct voter registration assistance
in public assistance offices in accordance with Section 7 of the NVRA. The Administration for Children and Families
and the Health Care Financing Administration will issue further guidance in program instructions as needed to AFDC
and Medicaid agencies regarding the implementation of these provisions. All relevant Federal agencies will continue
to work closely with each other and with State public assistance agencies toward the successful implementation of
this Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Section 9 of the NVRA the Federal Election Commission (FEC) is required to develop a national mail voter registration
form for elections to Federal office and to submit reports to Congress to assess the impacts of the legislation each
odd-numbered year beginning June 30, 1995. The FEC published an NPRM related to these provisions in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354) requires the Federal Government to anticipate and reduce the
impact of regulations and paperwork requirements on small businesses. The primary impact of these proposed rules
is on State governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities because they affect benefits to individuals and payments to States.
Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 13, 1994, the Coast Guard published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 47034). This proposed rule would promulgate a new subpart regulating certain equipment requirements and operating
procedures for fish tender vessels operating in the Aleutian trade. These regulations would allow for the continued
cargo service by water to remote communities in Alaska while ensuring increased safety standards for the vessels
engaged in this trade.

 incorrectly indicated the comment period would close November 14, 1993 vice November 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to be responsive to the best interests of the public and receive the greatest amount of input possible regarding
this proposed rulemaking, the Coast Guard has decided to reopen the comment period until December 31, 1994.

The Commission has adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making (Further Notice) aimed at establishing a flexible
regulatory scheme for Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) systems in the 800 MHz band. The intended effect of this Further
Notice is to solicit comment on assignment of blocks of SMR spectrum in defined market-based service areas that will
facilitate the development of wide-area, multi-channel SMR systems that are comparable to and compete with cellular
and broadhand Personal Communications Services (PCS) systems; how the needs of smaller SMR systems primarily seeking
to provide local service can best be accommodated under the proposed licensing scheme; regulatory treatment of existing
SMR systems; application and licensing procedures for both the wide-area SMR spectrum blocks and locally licensed
SMR channels; continued licensing of SMR systems on 800 MHz General Category channels or on other non-SMR channels
through inter-category sharing; and competitive bidding procedures for resolution of mutually exclusive 800 MHz
SMR applications.

Summary of Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Further Notice is intended to build upon and refine the Commission's previous efforts to promote the development
of wide-area SMR service in the 800 MHz band, particularly its 1993 Notice of Proposed Rule Making that initiated this
docket (8 FCC Rcd 3950 (1993), 58 FR 33062 (June 15, 1993)). The proposals presented in the Further Notice also are part
of the Commission's continuing implementation of the new regulatory framework for mobile radio services enacted
by Congress in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66, 107 Stat. 312, 392 (Budget Act).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 . In implementing the Budget Act, the Commission previously determined that its SMR channel assignment rules should
be revised to facilitate licensing in some portion of the 800 MHz SMR band on a Major Trading Area (MTA) basis. In the
Further Notice, the Commission proposes to divide the existing 14 MHz of SMR spectrum into two categories for future
licensing: (a) the 10 MHz ``upper block'', comprised of the 200 contiguous SMR channels (Channels 401 to 600), would
be licensed on an MTA basis; (b) the remaining 4 MHz, comprised of the 80 non-contiguous SMR channels, would be licensed
in groups of five channels on a local basis. The Commission tentatively concludes that the 10 MHz upper block of SMR
spectrum is best suited for wide-area licensing because of its contiguity.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Commission also seeks comment on its tentative conclusion that the 80 non-contiguous SMR channels should be
licensed on a local basis. The Commission seeks comment on whether dividing the 800 MHz band spectrum in this fashion
is fair and equitable and also solicits alternative allocations that would fairly balance the interests of wide-area
and local SMR systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Commission proposes to divide the upper 10 MHz ``MTA block'' into four blocks of 2.5 MHz, corresponding to 50
channels per block under our existing frequency allocation rules. The Commission seeks comment on whether the proposed
allocation is a fair division of channels within the MTA and will lead to efficient spectrum use and the appropriateness
of alternative block sizes both smaller and larger than 2.5 MHz.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In addition, the Commission tentatively concludes that a limit on the aggregation of 800 MHz SMR spectrum by a single
licensee within a particular MTA is unnecessary. The Commission previously concluded that 45 MHz cap on aggregation
of broadband PCS, cellular, and SMR spectrum, combined with existing service-specific caps for cellular and PCS,
was sufficient to maintain a competitive commercial mobile radio service market. The Commission nonetheless seeks
comment on whether there should be such an aggregation limit for 800 MHz SMR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Commission further propose to continue licensing SMR systems on the ``lower 80'' channels on a local basis in
order to provide opportunities for SMR operators who seek to provide local service. The Commission solicits comment
on two alternative approaches to local SMR licensing. The first alternative would be to continue licensing these
channels under the same geographic separation and channelization criteria that exist in the Commission's current
SMR rules. The second alternative would be to discontinue site-specific licensing and instead offer licenses for
individual channels or small channel blocks covering defined geographic areas. The Commission also seeks comment
on any possible licensing alternatives for the ``lower 80'' channels that might further promote the SMR operators'
ability to quickly gain access to spectrum and to provide efficient service to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Commission also proposes that MTA licensees will be entitled to use any available border area channels within
their spectrum blocks, subject to the relevant rules regarding international assignment and coordination of such
channels. The Commission seeks comment on this proposal and on how to license the channels in border areas that are
not contained in the proposed MTA block, which include both lower 80 SMR channels and channels that are allocated to
non-SMR services outside the border areas. The Commission proposes to license these channels on a channel-by-channel
basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The Commission believes that a key element in any new licensing scheme for wide-area SMR sytems is that licensees
be extended the same flexibility, to the extent feasible, as cellular and PCS licensees in terms of the location, design,
construction, and modification of their facilities throughout their service area. Thus, the Commission tentatively
concludes that MTA licensees in the 800 MHz band should be authorized to construct stations at any available site and
on any available channel within their MTAs (subject to their obligation to provide co-channel protection to incumbents
as discussed 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). It also proposes to allow MTA licensees to add, subtract, move, and otherwise modify their base station facilities
without any need for prior Commission consent, provided they notify the Commission of the coordinates and certify
compliance with other applicable FCC technical requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Commission proposes that if an incumbent fails to construct, discontinues operations, or otherwise has its
license terminated by the Commission, the spectrum covered by that incumbent's authorization should automatically
revert to the MTA licensee who has obtained the contingent rights to that spectrum. An additional proposal is that
the MTA license confer the right to negotiate with incumbent systems within the MTA to purchase or relocate their facilities.
In this regard, the Commission proposes that any request for transfer or assignment of an incumbent authorization
to the MTA licensee be presumptively considered in the public interest. The Commission seeks comment on these proposals
and other alternatives, including the costs and benefits associated with each alternative in markets that are heavily
occupied by incumbent licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The commission tentatively concludes that incumbent SMR systems should not be required to relocate new frequencies,
but that decisions regarding relocation should instead be left to the parties involved and the marketplace. Thus,
it asks commenters to address: (a) whether relying on voluntary negotiations between MTA licensees and incumbents
will continue to provide sufficient inducement for incumbents to relocate; (b) whether the Commission should intervene
if incumbents refuse ``reasonable'' inducements to relocate; and, (c) what constitutes a ``reasonable'' inducement
and the specific form of intervention, if any, that should be taken by the Commission in those instances when the incumbent
has refused such inducements. The Commission also seeks further comment on mandatory relocation as an alternative
to voluntary arrangements between MTA licensees and incumbents similar to the Commission's provisions for relocation
of microwave licensees from the 2 GHz PCS band. In addition, the Commission solicits comment on possible mechanisms
for ensuring that all relocation costs to incumbents would be guaranteed by the MTA licensee, descriptions of specific
costs, both direct and indirect, that would be associated with relocation (including whether they should be fully
reimbursable by the MTA licensee), and whether MTA licensees should be required to offer some form of premium over
cost (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 additional channels or improved facilities) if they seek to invoke a mandatory relocation option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Also, the Commission tentatively concludes that incumbent systems should not be allowed to expand beyond their
existing service areas on MTA-licensed channels without the consent of the MTA licensee. The Commission also proposes
to allow incumbent licenses to freely modify their facilities provided such modifications do not expand their service
areas. The Further Notice requests comment regarding the advantages and disadvantages of these proposals and specific
examples of circumstances under which incumbents should be permitted to modify their systems.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. The Commission seeks comment on whether a fixed-radius protected service area (e.g., 30 kilometers which approximates
the 40 dBu signal strength contour of an SMR station operating with maximum facilities) should be established for
incumbent SMR systems so that such systems may construct new base stations within the existing station's 40 dBu signal
strength contour. The Commission asks commenters to include a technical analysis of this proposal and any alternative
proposals that permit greater flexibility for locally licensed SMR systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The Commission has previously concluded that the co-channel interference protection obligations of SMR MTA
licensees with respect to other MTA licensees would be similar to those imposed in the cellular and PCS services where
licensees are required to comply with interference protection criteria between Commission-defined service areas
only at service area borders. Thus, the Commission tentatively concludes that wide-area SMR licensees in the 800
MHz band should not be allowed to exceed a signal level of 22 dBuV/m at their service area boundaries (unless they negotiate
a different signal strength limit with all potentially affected adjacent licensees).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. In addition, the Commission proposed to apply out-of-band emission rules only to the ``outer'' channels included
in a MTA license and to spectrum adjacent to interior channels used by incumbents. The proposed 800 MHz SMR emission
mask rule is that for any frequency outside an MTA licensee's frequency block, the power of any emission shall be attenuated
below the transmitter power (P) by at least 43 plus 10 log 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (P) decibels or 80 decibels, whichever is the lesser attenuation. The Further Notice seeks comment on this proposal
including a request for technical analysis of the proposal and discussion of any alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The Commission previously established a uniform 12-month period for constructing a standard base station in
all CMRS services licensed on a channel-by-channel basis. The Further Notice proposed to no longer grant extended
construction periods on non-MTA channels under &sect;90.629 of the Commission's rules. The Commission seeks comment
on whether strict enforcement of this construction period will be an adequate protection against spectrum warehousing
on frequencies occupied by local SMR systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The Commission tentatively concludes that MTA licensees should have five years to construct their systems. Because
some existing wide-area SMR licensees have already been granted extended implementation periods of up to five years,
the Commission requests comment on how existing licensees with extended implementation periods should be treated.
It also asks commenters to address what is a reasonable timeframe for completing such systems given the technologies
presently available in the SMR market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. The Commission proposes that MTA-based 800 MHz SMR licensees be required to provide coverage to one-third of the
MTA population within three years of initial license grant and to two-thirds of the population by the end of their five-year
construction period. The Commission further proposed that an MTA licensee must satisfy these requirements regardless
of the extent of the presence of incumbents within its MTA block. The Commission also seeks comment on whether a specific
definition of what constitutes coverage should be adopted for this service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
should single channel coverage be sufficient or should a mult-channel coverage requirement be imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. The Commission also tentatively concludes that an MTA licensee's failure to meet the coverage requirements imposed
either at the third or fifth years of its construction period should result in forfeiture of the license. This penalty
for failure to comply with coverage requirements is consistent with the penalties provided in the Commission's broadband
PCS rules and would allow the spectrum to be made available to other qualified applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The Commission tentatively concludes that the eligibility rules for the General Category channels and Industrial/Land
Transportation and Business Category Channels (collectively, ``Pool Channels'') should be revised to prohibit
SMR and non-SMR applicants from applying for the same channels in the future. The Commission seeks comment, however,
on how the spectrum should be allocated to address the relative demand for SMR and non-SMR services. One alternative
would be to eliminate SMR eligibility for all future licensing on General Category and Pool Channels. Another alternative
would be to prohibit future inter-category sharing by SMR applicants on Pool Channels, but to designate a portion
of the General Category for SMR-only licensing while the remaining channels would be available only to non-SMR licensees.
A third alternative would be to designate the entire General Category for future licensing exclusively to SMR applicants.
In light of the proposed restriction on future SMR use of Pool Channels, and possibly, General Category channels that
are designated for non-SMR use, the Commission also tentatively concludes that other Part 90 services should be restricted
from future eligibility for licenses on SMR Category channels. The Further Notice seeks comment on this proposal,
including whether incumbent SMRs on the General Category or Pool Channels should be allowed to apply for new authorizations
on these channels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The Commission proposes that both existing licensees and new applicants should be eligible for MTA licenses as
well as for local licenses in the 800 MHz SMR band. It requests comment on this proposal, including whether there is
any need to restrict eligibility for MTA licenses to incumbent licensees (or to restrict eligibility based on other
criteria) if competitive bidding procedures are used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
21. For 800 MHz SMR MTA licenses, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those used for licensing
of PCS based on the common use of Commission-defined geographic areas and spectrum blocks to define the scope of licenses
in both services. The Commission seeks comment on this view, and on any alternative procedural approach that commenters
may consider appropriate. It also proposes (1) to treat all MTA applicants as initial applicants for public notice,
application processing, and competitive bidding purposes, (2) to require applicants for MTA-based SMR licenses
to file an initial ``short-form'' application to qualify for competitive bidding, after which the successful bidder
files a ``long form'' application, and (3) to adopt rules analogous to its PCS rules with respect to application content,
amendment and modification of applications, return of defective applications, waiver procedures, and petitions
to deny. In addition, the Commission proposes to allow a limited opportunity for MTA applicants to cure minor defects
in their short-form applications (but not to allow major amendments after the expiration of the short-form filing
window) and to adopt rules regarding major and minor modification of MTA licenses and petition to deny procedures
(including ``greenmail'' restrictions limiting payments that a petitioner may receive in exchange for agreeing
to withdraw a petition) that are consistent with its PCS rules.

22. The Commission also seeks comment on licensing procedures for local SMR channels. If local licensing is based
on defined service areas, the Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those used for the licensing
of MTA blocks. If, on the other hand, site-specific licensing is adopted for the locally licensed SMR channels, the
Commission proposes to use application procedures similar to those recently adopted for non-cellular Part 22 licensees.
To the extent that 800 MHz SMR channels continue to be licensed on a site-specific basis, the Commission proposes to
classify the following as ``initial'' applications for new authorizations: all applications for new frequencies
or for stations more than 2 kilometers from an existing facility using the same channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. In addition, the Commission recently indicated that for CMRS providers licensed on a site-specific basis, major
modifications include a change in frequency, an increase in the effective radiated power or antenna height above
average terrain in any azimuth, or a change in location. The Commission seeks comment on the applicability of this
definition to locally licensed SMR systems and whether there are other types of modifications that should be deemed
major in this context. The Commission proposes that major modification applications would be subject to filing window
and cutoff procedures and processed on a first-come, first-served basis, except that (1) modification applications
that are mutually exclusive with initial or modification applications filed on the same day would be classified as
members of a ``same day filing group,'' and (2) modification applications filed within the 30-day public notice period
of a competing initial application would be considered part of the 30-day filing group. In both cases, the mutually
exclusive group of applications would be designated for comparative hearing (unless the parties negotiate a legal
settlement) because the Budget Act does not permit the use of competitive bidding procedures to determine whether
a modification application should be granted. The Further Notice seeks comment on whether our proposed definitions
and procedures for dealing with modification applications are appropriate for licensing of local SMR channels.
It also proposes adoption of petition to deny procedures for local SMR licensing similar to those proposed for MTA-based
licensing. The Commission seeks comment, however, on whether petitions to deny locally licensed SMR applications
should be filed within the initial 30-day public notice period following acceptance of such applications, or only
after an auction winner has been determined, as is proposed in the case of MTA applications. In either case, the Commission
intends to review only petitions filed against the auction winner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. The Commission proposes to classify all MTA licensees presumptively as CMRS providers because they are likely
to provide interconnected service as part of their service offering. It further proposes that such presumption may
be overcome by demonstrating that their service does not fall within the CMRS definition. In addition, the Further
Notice proposes not to apply this presumption prior to August 10, 1996 in the case of any MTA licensee who was previously
licensed in the SMR service as of August 10, 1993, and is therefore not subject to CMRS regulation for three years from
the Budget Act's enactment date. It also seeks comment on whether the presumption of CMRS status should apply to licensees
authorized for the 80 locally licensed channels.

25. The Commission believes that multiple bidding methodologies may be required for licensing of 800 MHz SMR service
because the two proposed categories of licenses (MTA-based and local) will vary significantly from one another in
terms of expected value and interdependence. In addition, it believes that competitive bidding in the 800 MHz SMR
service presents a number of variables that have not been presented in other services for which auction rules have
been developed. In particular, the proposed licensing of local SMR channels on a site-specific basis requires examination
of how competitive bidding would work in a context where mutually exclusive applicants have applied for overlapping
rather than identical authorizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The Commission tentatively concludes that simultaneous multiple round bidding is most likely to award MTA licenses
to bidders who value them most highly. the Further Notice asks commenters whether any other competitive bidding designs
might be more appropriate for the MTA-based licensing of 800 MHz SMR spectrum. Assuming simultaneous multiple round
auctions are used, the Commission also seeks comment on which blocks should be auctioned together, the intervals
between rounds in each auction, and the sequencing of each auction. Its tentative view is that all MTA licenses should
be auctioned simultaneously because of the relatively high value and significant interdependence of the licenses.
The Further Notice seeks comment on its view and on possible alternatives for grouping of licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. The Commission tentatively concludes that a simpler and less costly auction method, such as single round sealed
bid auctions, should be used for licensing the 80 local SMR channels. The Further Notice also asks commenters to suggest
alternative bidding designs. For example, if these channels are licensed on a site-specific basis, one alternative
would be to allow mutually exclusive applications to use negotiated settlements or coordination to minimize the
number of overlapping applications that would require resolution by competitive bidding. Another alternative
would be to divide the local 80 SMR channels into defined geographic areas (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 BTAs) and small blocks of channels (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 five or ten channels) and conduct a series of separate auctions for mutually exclusive applications within each area/block
combination. The Commission seeks comment on the practicality of these alternatives, whether these auctions for
the local licenses should be conducted separately or simultaneously, and how such licenses should be ordered for
auction purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. The Commission also seeks comment on bidding procedures to be used in 800 MHz SMR auctions, including bid increments,
duration of bidding rounds, stopping rules, and activity rules. Assuming that simultaneous multiple round auctions
are used for MTA-based SMR licenses, the Commission generally proposed to use the same or similar bidding procedures
to those used in simultaneous multiple round bidding for MTA-based PCS licenses. In the case of locally licensed 800
MHz SMR channels, the Further Notice seeks comment on bidding procedures that would be appropriate depending on whether
single round sealed bid auctions or an alternative auction methodology is used. It generally proposed to follow the
procedural, payment, and penalty rules established in Subpart Q of Part 1 of the Commission's Rules, but seeks comment
on whether any service-specific modifications of these rules are needed based on the particular characteristics
of the 800 MHz SMR service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. As in the case of other auctionable services, the Commission proposes to require SMR auction participants to tender
in advance to the Commission a substantial upfront payment as a condition of bidding. It seeks comment on whether the
standard upfront payment formula of $0.02 per pop per MHz for the largest combination of MHz-pops a bidder anticipates
bidding on in any single round of bidding is appropriate for 800 MHz SMR services. The Commission also proposes to require
that winning bidders for 800 MHz SMR licenses supplement their upfront payments with a down payment sufficient to
bring their total deposits up to 20 percent of their winning bid(s).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30. The Commission further proposes to adopt bid withdrawal, default, and disqualification rules for 800 MHz SMR
licensing based on its general competitive bidding rules and seeks comment on these proposals. Under these procedures,
any bidder who withdraws a high bid during an auction before the Commission declares bidding closed, or defaults by
failing to remit the required down payment within the prescribed time, would be required to reimburse to the Commission
the difference between its high bid and the winning bid amount the next time the license is offered by the Commission,
if the subsequent winning bid is lower. A defaulting auction winner would be assessed an additional penalty of three
percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less. In the
event that an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified, we propose to re-auction the license either to
existing or new applicants. The Commission would retain discretion, however, to offer the license to the next highest
bidder at its final bid level if the default occurs within five business days of the close of bidding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. The Further Notice also proposes to adopt the transfer disclosure requirements contained in Section 1.211(a)
of the Commission's rules for all 800 MHz SMR licenses obtained by competitive bidding and specific rules governing
unjust enrichment by designated entities. Generally, applicants transferring their licenses within three years
after the initial license grant will be required to file, together with their transfer application, the associated
contracts for sale, option agreements, management agreements, and all other documents disclosing the total consideration
received in return for the transfer of its license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. The Commission also proposes to apply its previously adopted special rules prohibiting collusive conduct in
the context of competitive bidding to the 800 MHz SMR service and seeks comment on this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. The Further Notice proposes specific measures and eligibility criteria for designated entities, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
businesses owned by minorities and/or women, small businesses, and rural telephone companies. The Commission seeks
comment on these proposals, and specifically on identifying special provisions that will create meaningful incentives
and opportunities for such entities that are tailored to the unique characteristics of the 800 MHz SMR service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. The Commission proposes to utilize bidding credits and a tax certificate program to encourage participation
by businesses owned by women and minorities in auctions for the 800 MHz SMR service. It seeks comment on whether the
likely value of MTA-based SMR licenses would support a 40 percent bidding credit, but proposes a bidding credit of
25 percent for the ``lower 80'' channel licenses given their expected lower value. To prevent unjust enrichment by
women and minorities trafficking in licenses acquired through the use of bidding credits, the Further Notice proposes
imposition of a forfeiture requirement on transfers of such licenses to entities that are not owned by women or minorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. The Commission also proposes to establish a tax certificate program under which tax certificates would be issued
to: (a) non-controlling initial investors in minority and women-owned 800 MHz SMR applicants and licensees, upon
the sale of their non-controlling interests; and, (b) 800 MHz SMR licensees who assign or transfer control of their
licenses to minority and women-owned entities. It also proposes to impose a one-year holding requirement on the transfer
or assignment of 800 MHz SMR licenses obtained through the benefit of tax certificates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. In terms of eligibility criteria, the Commission proposes that in order to be deemed a business owned by minorities
and/or women, minorities or women must have at least 50.1 percent equity ownership and a 50.1 controlling interest
in the designated entity. For limited partnerships, the general partner must be a minority and/or a woman (or an entity
100 percent owned and controlled by minorities and/or women) that owns at least 50.1 percent of the partnership equity.
In the PCS context, the Commission established an alternative definition for minority- and female-owned businesses
whereby women and/or minority principals control the applicant and own at least 25 percent of the equity and 50.1 percent
of the voting stock (in the case of corporations). The Further Notice seeks comment on which of these definitions is
most appropriate for purposes of determining designated entity eligibility in the 800 MHz SMr service, or whether
both definitions should be adopted in the alternative. It also proposes to apply to the 800 MHz SMR applicants the same
affiliation and attribution rules for calculating equity and stock ownership previously adopted in the PCS context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. The Commission proposes to adopt installment payments for small businesses bidding for 800 MHz SMR licenses.
To ensure that large businesses do not become the unintended beneficiaries of installment payment provisions meant
for small businesses, the Commission also proposes to make the unjust enrichment provisions in its general competitive
bidding rules applicable to installment payments by SMR applicants. The Commission seeks comment on this proposal
including whether additional unjust enrichment provisions are necessary for the 800 MHz SMR service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
38. In terms of eligibility criteria, the Commission presents two alternatives for a small business definition.
One alternative is the existing SBA net worth/net income size standard where an entity would qualify as a small business
if its net worth is not in excess of $6 million with average net income after Federal income taxes for the two preceding
years not in excess of $2 million. A second alternative is adoption of a gross revenue standard like that used in the
broadband PCS context. The Further Notice requests commenters to address whether the SBA definition or a gross revenue
standard should be used and the appropriate gross revenue threshold for the 800 MHz SMR context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. The Commission seeks comment on Whether bidding credits or other special provisions should be provided for rural
telephone companies, but does not propose to adopt such special provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40. In addition to the special provisions proposed above for designated entities, the Commission solicits comment
on the following alternatives and related issues for the 800 MHz SMR service: (1) expansion of eligibility for installment
payments to designated entities other than small businesses; (2) reduction in upfront payment for any class of designated
entities; (3) the costs and benefits with respect to auction administration and designated entity participation
associated with a reduced upfront payment in the 800 SMR service in the absence of a spectrum set-aside; and (4) whether
the ``lower 80'' channels should be designated as an ``entrepreneurs' block.'' The Commission tentatively concludes
that it would not be feasible to designate an MTA channel block as an entrepreneur's block because the large number
of incumbents already licensed throughout the proposed MTA band make it virtually impossible to identify a particular
block that would be suitable. On the other hand, an entrepreneurs' block approach could be more feasible for the ``lower
80'' channels, which we contemplate will be used primarily, if not exclusively, for operation of local SMR systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. In addition, if the Commission adopts an entrepreneurs' block approach, it seeks comment on how eligibility for
the block should be defined. Specifically, commenters are asked to address whether applicants other than designated
entities should be eligible to bid for entrepreneurs' block licenses, whether the same financial caps should be applied
for determining eligibility for SMR entrepreneurs' block licenses, how designated entities should be treated within
the entrepreneurs' block in terms of eligibility criteria and special provisions. The Further Notice also requests
comment on whether the definitions for small businesses and business owned by minorities and/or women should be different
for purposes of determining eligibility for the entrepreneurs' block, what specific special provisions should
be afforded to designated entities within the entrepreneurs' block, what type of attribution and affiliation rules
should apply, and what additional measures are needed to protect against unjust enrichment.

A. Reason for Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule making proceeding was initiated to secure comment on proposals for establishing a flexible regulatory
scheme for the 800 MHz SMR service that would promote efficient licensing and enhance the service's competitive potential
in the commercial mobile radio marketplace. The proposals advanced in the Further Notice are also designed to implement
Congress's goal of regulatory symmetry in the regulation of competing commercial mobile radio services as described
in Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 153(n), 332, as amended by Title VI of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Budget Act). The Commission also seeks to adopt rules regarding competitive bidding
in the 800 MHz SMR service based on Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 309(J), which delegates authority
to the Commission to use auctions to select among mutually exclusive applications in certain services, including
800 MHz SMR.

B. Objectives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposes changes to its rules for the 800 MHz SMR service that are intended to promote the growth of both
traditional local SMR service and emerging wide-area SMR services, and to enhance the ability of all SMR providers
to compete in the larger commercial mobile services market. Specifically, the Commission seeks to designate a block
of contiguous spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR band for licensing to wide-area systems to enable them to use innovative wideband
technologies and compete more effectively against Personal Communications Services and cellular, which also use
contiguous spectrum. The Commission proposes to license non-contiguous spectrum in the 800 MHz SMR band on a local
basis to provide opportunities for smaller SMR systems that seek to provide local niche services. It also seeks to
encourage more efficient use of spectrum in congested areas and to accommodate technologically advanced systems.
Finally, the Further Notice seeks to establish a new licensing mechanism for the 800 MHz SMR service that will significantly
streamline the processing of applications, reducing the administrative burden for both applicants and the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal contained in the Further Notice, SMR licensees who obtain MTA-based licenses may be required to
report information regarding location of their facilities and coverage of their service areas. SMR applicants seeking
treatment as ``designated entities'' may also be subject to reporting and recordkeeping requirements to demonstrate
compliance with our competitive bidding rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Further Notice potentially affects numerous small entities already operating 800 MHz SMR systems on frequencies
that would be designated for licensing on a wide-area bases. The Further Notice of proposed Rule making tentatively
concludes that existing licensees on these frequencies should be allowed to continue operating under their existing
authorizations, but also seeks to encourage voluntary frequency transfers or other arrangements to allow for efficient
spectrum use. The competitive bidding proposals contained in the Further Notice also could affect small entities
seeking initial licenses in the 800 MHz SMR service. The Further Notice proposes special provisions in the Commission's
auction rules to benefit ``designated entity'' applicants, including small businesses. After evaluating comments
filed in response to the Further Notice, the Commission will examine further the impact of all rule changes on small
entities and set forth its findings in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), announces negative 90-day and 12-month findings on 11 petitions to
list 20 invertebrates under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. After careful assessment of the best scientific
and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the petitioned species, the
Service either finds that the petitioners have not presented substantial information indicating the requested
actions may be warranted (90-day finding) or determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time (12-month
finding).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires that the Service make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents
substantial scientific or commercial information indicating the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum
extent practicable, this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be
published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the Service finds that a petition presents substantial information indicating the requested action may be warranted,
then the Service initiates a status review on that species. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that for any petition
that presents substantial scientific and commercial information, a finding be made within 12 months of the date of
receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but
precluded from immediate proposal by other pending proposals to list, delist, or reclassify species. Such 12-month
findings are to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has made negative 90-day findings on 7 of the 11 petitions to list 16 invertebrates; the Marin blind harvestman,
Anza Borrego blind harvestman, Silver Creek blind harvestman, Ross micro-blind harvestman, Ubick's gnaphosid
spider, unsilvered fritillary butterfly, Jacalitos jerusalem cricket, Berkeley ground cricket, Jacalitos shield-backed
katydid, splendid shield-backed katydid, Antioch shield-backed katydid, San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper,
Lompoc grasshopper, Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper, Central Valley grasshopper, and Mexicali lubber grasshopper.
The Service finds that the petitioners have not presented substantial information indicating the requested actions
for these 16 taxa may be warranted. In addition, the Service has made negative 12-month findings on 4 of the 11 petitions
for 4 invertebrates; the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman, Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman, Yontocket ringlet
butterfly, and Opler's longhorn moth. The Service has been assessing the status of these four taxa since their designation
as category 2 candidates. Minimal new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign
these invertebrates to category 2. As a result, the Service determines that the petitioned action is not warranted
at this time. These four taxa will be retained in category 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 6, 1989, the Service received a petition from Dr. Thomas Briggs of the California Academy of Sciences to list
the Marin blind harvestman (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calicina diminua
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species. The letter, dated July 6, 1989, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name,
signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition stated that the Marin blind harvestman is known only from a portion of Burdell Mountain in Marin County,
California. This species was described from 18 specimens collected under rocks in serpentine grassland at this location
(Ubick and Briggs 1989). The threat cited by the petitioner is the construction of the Buck Center for Research on Aging.
The proposed project includes the designation of a 300-acre conservation area and a 188-acre development area. The
proposed activities include a research center, a residential area, parking lots, and roadways. The Marin blind harvestman
is only known from three locations, two occurring on the proposed Buck Center for Research on Aging site (EIP Associates
1992). Based on an analysis of the draft environmental impact report for the proposed project, one of two serpentine
rock outcrops containing the species would be damaged or lost (EIP Associates 1992, Western Ecological Services
Company 1990). The extent of adequate surveys for this species that have been conducted in suitable habitats in Marin
County is not clear. A map displaying the geological features of Burdell Mountain and adjacent areas was also examined
in conjunction with this review. The 1:250,000 geological base map for the Santa Rosa Quadrangle (California Division
of Mines and Geology 1980) reveals other serpentine outcrops within the general vicinity of Burdell Mountain. Some
of these outcrops appear to provide approximately the same combination of geographic features as the known habitats
on Burdell Mountain. The petition and supporting documentation indicate that adequate surveys of these other potential
habitats were not conducted for the Marin blind harvestman. Moreover, because the petition did not present information
on whether the Marin blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution
and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of
the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that
the requested action may be warranted.

On July 17, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Mr. Darrell Ubick of the California Academy of Sciences
to list the Anza Borrego blind harvestman (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sitalcina borregoensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated July 14, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and
contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petition, the Anza Borrego blind harvestman is known only from an isolated palm grove at Mountain
Palm Springs, a canyon in Anza Borrego State Park in San Diego County, California. Within this site, the petitioners
reported that harvestmen have been found only at a ``few moist spots near the palm trees.'' They stated the animal could
be harmed by any development at this location. Mountain Palm Springs is an unimproved campground that is regularly
patrolled by park rangers (Bill Tippets and Mark Jorgensen, California Department of Parks and Recreation, pers.
comm., November 16, 1990). Off-road vehicle use, which has caused extensive habitat destruction in other areas of
the southwestern United States, is not a problem at this location (Mark Jorgensen, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ibid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Six palm (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Washingtonia filifera
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) groves occur in the immediate vicinity of the campground and 25 palm groves exist in Anza Borrego State Park, of which,
five are located within 10 miles of Mountain Palm Springs. The petitioners did not indicate if surveys had been conducted
at any of these other similar habitats. Moreover, because the petition did not present information on whether the
Anza Borrego blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution
and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of
the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that
the requested action may be warranted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 17, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Ubick to list the Silver Creek blind harvestman (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calicina jungi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated July 14, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and
contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition stated that the Silver Creek blind harvestman is known only from rocky serpentine grassland, 0.9 miles
southeast of the junction of Silver Creek and San Felipe Roads, near San Jose in Santa Clara County, California. The
petitioners noted that urban development imperils this species and a pipeline was laid through its habitat on or before
1990. In a letter dated January 13, 1990, the petitioners stated they had searched for blind harvestmen and micro-blind
harvestmen in the vicinity of Silver Creek and Metcalf Canyon Roads in the San Jose area during 4 days in 1966 and 1 day
in 1983. The petition and supporting documentation indicate that the surveys of these other potential habitats for
the Silver Creek blind harvestman were inadequate. Though the Silver Creek blind harvestman may be declining, additional
adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner
presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present
substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 31, 1989, the Service received a petition from Briggs to list the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microcina lumi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species. The letter, dated October 26, 1989, was clearly identified as a petition and contained
the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. The Fairmont micro-blind harvestman
was designated a category 2 candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58804).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner stated that the known distribution of the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman is limited to two serpentine
outcrops on Fairmont Ridge, near the City of San Leandro in Alameda County, California. The petitioner stated that
all other suitable habitats in this area have been searched without success. A proposed housing development and overgrazing
by livestock were cited as the basis for the requested action. The Service reviewed the petition and supporting documents,
including a scientific paper describing the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microcina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the species 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. lumi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Briggs and Ubick 1989) and a map displaying the geological features of Fairmont Ridge and adjacent areas. This map,
a 1:250,000 geological base map for the San Francisco quadrangle (California Division of Mines and Geology 1980),
reveals other serpentine outcrops within the general vicinity of Fairmont Ridge. Some of these outcrops appear to
provide approximately the same combination of geographic features as the known habitats on Fairmont Ridge. Though
urban development and grazing remain a threat in the species' known habitat, other potential habitats remain unsurveyed
for the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman. Moreover, no new information was received or available to the Service beyond
that used to assign this species to category 2. As a result, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific
and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the Fairmont micro-blind
harvestman and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 22, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Ubick to list the Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microcina edgewoodensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species. The letter, dated March 20, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the
names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. The Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman
was designated a category 2 candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 58804).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the petitioners, the Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman is known only from Edgewood County Park and
a site west of Interstate Highway 280 in San Mateo County, California known as the ``Triangle'' (these two localities
were cited as three sites in the petition). This species was described from three male specimens collected at these
two locations (Briggs and Ubick 1989). The animals were found beneath rocks in serpentine grassland adjacent to scrub
oaks. The threat cited by the petitioners is unspecified development at the Triangle. The Service is not aware of any
development currently proposed for this specific area. In addition, serpentine grassland in this area is being protected
due to the presence of the threatened bay checkerspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha bayensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). A study commissioned by the County of San Mateo determined that it is not feasible to construct a golf course at Edgewood
County Park (Thomas Reid Associates 1993). The County of San Mateo has designated Edgewood County Park as natural
open space (Barrales and Huening 1993, San Mateo County Board of Supervisors 1993). In light of the above discussion
and because no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this species to category
2, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present
and future threats facing the Edgewood micro-blind harvestman and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted
at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1991, the Service received a petition from Briggs to list the Ross micro-blind harvestman (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microcina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sp.) as an endangered species. The letter, dated November 27, 1991, was clearly identified as a petition and contained
the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition reported the Ross micro-blind harvestman is known only from specimens collected in February 1991 on
a portion of Bald Hill in Ross, Marin County, California. The petitioner, a blind harvestmen specialist, stated that
this is a valid species based on morphological characters. This undescribed species was collected under sandstone
rocks in a grassland-oak and bay woodland ecotone directly east of the summit of Bald Hill at an elevation of 880 feet.
The petitioner cited a proposed residential development as the threat to the Ross micro-blind harvestman. A residential
development had been proposed for this site and a final environmental impact report was certified by the Ross Planning
Commission (Gary Broad, Ross Planning Department, pers. comm., 1993). However, the project was denied by the City
Council and court challenges by the project proponent were unsuccessful. Projects may be proposed for this location
in the future but none have been made to date. As a result, the Service considers such threats to the Ross micro-blind
harvestman to be of low magnitude and non-imminent. Because the petition did not present information on whether the
Ross micro-blind harvestman may be declining or located elsewhere, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess
its distribution and population status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data
on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information
that the requested action may be warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 11, 1992, the Service received a petition from Ubick to list Ubick's gnaphosid spider (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Talanites ubicki
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a threatened or endangered species. The letter, dated November 29, 1992, was clearly identified as a petition
and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition stated that Ubick's gnaphosid spider is only known from a single locality on the southern slope of Burdell
Mountain in Novato, Marin County, California (Platnick and Ovtsharenko 1991). The habitat at the site consists of
serpentine grassland. Gnaphosids are small, hunting spiders that construct a tubular retreat under stones and in
debris and hunt at night from this location (Borror 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1976; Jones 1983). The petitioner cited urban development as the threat to this species and stated that part of the
locality inhabited by Ubick's gnaphosid spider has been destroyed by a road that was constructed a few years ago. The
proposed project, the Buck Center for Research on Aging, includes the designation of a 300-acre conservation area
and a 188-acre development area. Proposed activities include a research center, a residential area, parking lots,
and roadways. The information provided by the petitioner indicates that the remaining portions of the serpentine
rock outcrops inhabited by Ubick's gnaphosid spider are located within the conservation area. The petition from
Ubick did not indicate if adequate surveys had been conducted at other similar habitats in the area. Beyond the information
described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines
that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ms. Katrin Snow of the Xerces Society in Portland, Oregon, petitioned the Service to list Opler's longhorn moth as
an endangered species in a letter dated December 19, 1990, which was received on January 14, 1991. The letter, dated
December 19, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation,
address, and telephone number of the petitioner. Opler's longhorn moth was placed in category 2 on November 21, 1991

Opler's longhorn moth is a member of the longhorn moth family, the Adelidae (Davis 1987, Powell 1969). It is a small,
dark bronze colored, day flying moth with long antennae. The adults have a wingspan ranging from approximately 9 to
14 millimeters. Opler's longhorn moth is recorded from 18 sites extending along the west side of the San Francisco
Bay from 5 miles southeast of Nicasio in Marin County south to the Gilroy area of Santa Clara County and from the Oakland
area on the inner Coast Ranges. A single population is known from central Santa Cruz County. Excepting the Santa Cruz
County locality that consists of a grassland habitat derived from marine sand deposits, Opler's longhorn moth is
restricted to sites within serpentine grassland. The extent of survey efforts that have been conducted in suitable
habitat in the San Francisco Bay area is unclear. At least 13 areas with serpentine soils within the range of Opler's
longhorn moth cover more than 40 acres each (McCarten 1986, 1987). The larvae of Opler's longhorn moth feeds on

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(cream cups), a widespread annual plant. In contrast to other invertebrate groups, such as butterflies and tiger
beetles, whose biology, ecology, and biogeography are well known, few amateur or professional entomologists collect
or study adelid moths and other microlepidoptera. Though urban development threaten a portion of the species' range
of Opler's longhorn moth, additional status information (e.g., rangewide surveys) are needed prior to proposing
the species. Moreover, no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this
species to category 2. As a result, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information
available regarding the present and future threats facing Opler's longhorn moth and determines that the petitioned
action is not warranted at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 8, 1990, the Service received a petition from Dr. Dennis Murphy of the Stanford University Center for Conservation
biology to list the Yontocket ringlet butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Coenonympha tullia yontocket
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) as a threatened or endangered species. The petitioner stated that the insect merits protection under the Act because
it is known only from a single coastal dune locality in Del Norte County, California. The area is used for target shooting,
off-road vehicles, garbage dumping, and camping, all potentially damaging activities to this population. Invasive
exotic vegetation and potential housing development also likely imperiled the area. Based on this information,
the Service issued a 90-day finding on November 1, 1991, which found that the petition presented substantial information
indicating that the requested action may be warranted (55 FR 46801). A status review of the Yontocket ringlet butterfly
was initiated at the same time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Yontocket ringlet butterfly was described by Porter and Mattoon (1989) from 76 specimens collected at several
sites extending from Lake Earl to the mouth of the Smith River in Del Norte County, California. These sites likely represent
a single population. The animal was found in dunes with coniferous lee slopes and grassy exposed slopes, and among
dunes on slightly elevated ground around seasonally marshy sphagnum bogs. Sterling Mattoon (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991) provided information regarding the range of the yontocket ringlet butterfly and presented data showing that
the 11 known populations of this species range from Enderts Beach, 5 miles south of Crescent City, north along the coast
to the mouth of the Pistol River, Curry County, Oregon. A population is known approximately 0.7 to 2.2 miles inland
from the vicinity of the town of Carpenterville in Curry County. This substantially increases the number of populations
and extends the range of the species approximately 22 miles north and 15 miles south of its previously known distribution.
The type and degree of threats to these populations were not stated in the petition and other information available
to the Service. In light of these data gaps, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial
information available regarding the present and future threats facing the yontocket ringlet butterfly and determines
that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On January 6, 1992, the Service received a petition from Drs. Dennis Murphy and Alan Launer of the Stanford University
Center for Conservation Biology to list the unsilvered fritillary butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Speyeria adiaste adiaste
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated December 31, 1991, was clearly identified as a petition
and contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, address, and telephone number of the petitioners.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition stated that the unsilvered fritillary butterfly has been recorded from San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa
Cruz counties (Sterling Mattoon, pers. comm., 1992; C.D. Nagano, unpub. obs.). This species is now found primarily
in areas along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains or east of the crest in the northern and central areas of Santa Cruz
County (Steiner 1990). The petitioners reported that recent colonies are known from four general areas in this region.
The biology, ecology, and biogeography of the unsilvered fritillary is not well known. The foodplant of the larvae,
violets (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Viola 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sp.), is found in fern-dominated grassland glades or wetland areas. A large population occurs within Big Basin Redwood
State Park in Santa Cruz County. The potential threats include urban development and suppression of fire. Lack of
fire may allow succession to proceed and eliminate suitable foodplant and larval habitat. Although, the unsilvered
fritillary butterfly may be declining, existing information is not available to estimate the extent or rate of changes
in habitat or population levels. Further surveys are needed to adequately assess its distribution and population
status. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner few data presented little else on the status of the
animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that the
requested action may be warranted.

The petitioned species are characterized by a substantial lack of information regarding their geographical range,
ecological requirements, and population status. The Natural Diversity Data Base of the California Department of
Fish and Game had no records of any of these animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition stated that the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket is known from Jacalitos Canyon and the Panoche Hills in Fresno
County, and Kettleman Hills in Kings County. Tinkham and Rentz (1969) reported records from two localities in Tulare
County and three localities in western Fresno County. The Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket is restricted to areas containing
sandstone and is found primarily under rocks at the bases of hillsides (Tinkham and Rentz 1969). No data are available
on the specific localities or status of the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket. The petitioner stated that the Jacalitos
shield-backed katydid is known from two male specimens. No information was presented on the specific localities,
habitat requirements, or status of the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid. Oil drilling and livestock grazing were
cited as threats to these two animals. Jacalitos Canyon is included as a conservation area in the Coalinga Habitat
Conservation Plan (Ron Rempel, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm. 1993). No urban development is
proposed or likely in this area because of a lack of water. Indirect protection for the Jacalitos Jerusalem cricket
and the Jacalitos shield-backed katydid may be provided by the presence of the endangered San Joaquin kit fox (

Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested
action may be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The splendid shield-backed katydid is only known from two localities, Barstow and 3 miles west of Essex, San Bernardino
County, California. This species has been found in creosote bushes (Rentz and Birchim 1968). The petitioner stated
that a female specimen reported from the Imperial Valley in Imperial County, California, is apparently a different
species. No information was presented to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or population
status of this animal. No threats to this species were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the Service. Beyond
the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service
determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.

The petition and other information available to the Service indicate that the Berkeley ground cricket is known from
four localities in the San Francisco Bay area of California (Rehn and Hebard 1918, Weissman and Rentz 1977, Vickery
and Weissman 1989). A population is protected at the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve and another population is unprotected
in a heavily grazed pasture on Stanford University (Weissman and Rentz 1977). The petitioner stated that grazing
may benefit the species. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of
the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that
the requested action may be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Antioch shield-backed katydid is known only from a single male specimen collected in 1937 at the Antioch sand dunes
in Contra Costa County, California (Rentz 1977). Though the dunes historically covered an estimated 190 acres, only
70 acres remain (United States Fish and Wildlife Service 1984). The natural habitats in this area have been adversely
effected by industrialization, sand mining, urbanization, agricultural land conversion, off-road vehicles,
wildfire, and other human impacts. As suggested by its specific epithet, the Antioch shield-backed katydid is presumed
extinct, given the extent of habitat loss and absence of any observations since 1937. Diligent searches for this animal
have been conducted by numerous professional and amateur entomologists over a period of several decades but no further
individuals have been located (Powell 1978, Rentz 1977). Conversely, if the species is still extant on the sand dunes,
it likely would be protected because most of the remaining natural dunes are secured by the Service's ownership and
management of the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge. This refuge was created to protect the endangered Lange's
metalmark butterfly (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Bernardino Mountains grasshopper is known only from Vivian and High Creeks in the San Bernardino Mountains
of San Bernardino County, California (Otte 1984, Rentz and Weissman 1984). The species inhabits ponderosa pine forest
at altitudes of 1820 to 2743 meters (Rentz and Weissman 1984). Little information is available on the specific localities,
habitat requirements, or status of this species. No threats to this animal were cited in the petition or are otherwise
known to the Service. Beyond the information described above, the petition presented few data on the status of the
animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the
requested action may be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lompoc grasshopper is known from Lompoc in Santa Barbara County and Paso Robles in San Luis Obispo County during
the month of August (Otte 1984). No data are available to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements,

Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested
action may be warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Santa Monica Mountains grasshopper is known only from the western Santa Monica Mountains in Los Angeles and Ventura
Counties. This species has been found on bare hillsides and along dirt trails in chaparral (Rentz and Weissman 1981).
The petitioner did not cite any threats, but noted that two locations inhabited by this species have been destroyed
by development. Little information exists on the habitat requirements or status of this species. Beyond the information
described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines
that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted.

1968). The petitioner stated that this species has not been collected since 1953. The Central Valley grasshopper
has been found on low, dry desert flats during the months of July and August in the vicinity of Bakersfield, Ceres, and
Turlock (Otte 1984). No data are available to the Service on the specific localities, habitat requirements, or status
of the Central Valley grasshopper. No threats to this animal were cited in the petition or are otherwise known to the
Service. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1968) and Helfer (1963), this animal is an inhabitant of low, silt or dry, sandy desert areas that are subject to extremely
high temperatures. The petitioner did not cite any threats to this species, however, three populations have been
eliminated by development in 1961 and 1972 (Tinkham 1975). Rehn and Grant (1961) and Tinkham (1975) provided information
on the ecology and some populations of this animal. No current information is available on the status of the Mexicali
lubber grasshopper. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the
animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioner did not present substantial information that the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with the framework procedure for adjusting management measures of the Fishery Management Plan for
the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico (FMP), NMFS proposes to reduce the bag limit for red snapper to zero for
the operator and crew of a vessel operating as a charter vessel or headboat; reduce the daily bag limit for red snapper
to five for other persons subject to the bag limit; and increase the minimum allowable size of red snapper, currently
14 inches (35.6 cm), to 15 inches (38.1 cm) for persons subject to the bag limit. NMFS also proposes to delay the opening
of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. NMFS intends that these management measure adjustments,
if adopted in final, become effective January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year. The intended effects
of this rule are to prevent overfishing of red snapper and to ensure that the commercial red snapper fishery is open
when demand for fresh fish is at its highest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The red snapper stock assessment completed by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, NMFS, in September 1994 indicated
that the spawning potential ratio (SPR) has increased from less than 1 percent in 1984 to about 2 percent in 1994. This
increase is due to the conservation measures already in place. However, the FMP has a goal of 20 percent SPR for all reef
fish, and a target date for recovery of the overfished red snapper stock by the year 2009. Based on data in the assessment
and the FMP's rebuilding schedule, the Council's Reef Fish Stock Assessment Panel (SAP) calculated the allowable
biological catch (ABC) as having an upper limit of 6.00 million pounds (m lb) (2.72 million kg (m kg)). The Council's
Socioeconomic Panel (SEP) recommended that the ABC be established specifically at 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the SAP's and SEP's reports, the Council recommends a continuation of TAC at the upper end of the ABC range,
6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg), for 1995. A 1995 TAC of 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg) is consistent with the FMP's rebuilding program for red
snapper, and is within the framework bounds established in the FMP. NMFS is requesting public comment on the Council's
recommended TAC for 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Management Measures Associated With Red Snapper TAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMP's framework procedure requires that allocations of the red snapper TAC be based on a historical 51/49 commercial/recreational
harvest ratio. A TAC of 6.00 m lb (2.72 m kg), therefore, results in a commercial quota of 3.06 m lb (1.39 m kg) and a recreational
allocation of 2.94 m lb (1.33 m kg). The recreational fishery is managed by bag and minimum size limits, currently 7
fish and 14 inches (35.6 cm), respectively. The 1994 stock assessment showed that the recreational fishing harvest
greatly exceeded the recreational fishery allocation in 1992, 1993, and is expected to do so in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the recreational fishery does not exceed its 1995 allocation of 2.94 m lb (1.33 m kg), the recreational
harvest must be reduced by about 43 percent from the 1993 harvest level, estimated at approximately 5.10 m lb (2.31
m kg). Preliminary estimates presented to the Council by its staff indicated that a 15-inch (38.1-cm) size limit and
5-fish bag limit together would achieve a 38-percent harvest reduction from the 1993 level, assuming the validity
of a 33-percent release mortality utilized in the stock assessment. The remaining necessary harvest reduction of
5 percent is expected to result from the proposed catch restriction for charter vessel and headboat operators and
crew. The Council heard extensive public testimony from charter vessel and headboat operators who claimed that severe
adverse social and economic impacts would result from reduction of the red snapper bag limit, particularly if decreased
to less than five fish per customer. Several of these operators suggested elimination of red snapper harvest by the
charter vessel and headboat operators and crew to help achieve the necessary reduction in recreational harvest (compared
to 1993 levels). Industry representatives who testified to the Council characterized that measure, considered
as an alternative, as less disruptive than a severe reduction in the bag limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council, following its review of all available information, determined that more restrictive red snapper size
and bag limits are necessary to avoid additional overruns of the recreational allocation that could lead to overfishing.
Accordingly, the Council recommended, and NMFS is proposing: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reduction of the bag limit for red snapper to zero for charter vessel and headboat operators and crew; (2) a reduction
of the daily bag limit for red snapper to five for other persons; and (3) an increase in the minimum allowable size of
red snapper to 15 inches (38.1 cm), applicable to red snapper taken under the bag limit. If adopted in final, these measures
would be made effective January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed reduction in the red snapper recreational catch is designed to maintain allocations between the recreational
and commercial sectors and to ensure that the total red snapper harvest in 1995 remains within the TAC level, thereby
adhering to the FMP's stock rebuilding program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Council submitted its recommended 1995 management measures for red snapper, NMFS has completed a new evaluation
of the probable magnitude of the 1994 and 1995 recreational red snapper harvests; this analysis assumes implementation
of the proposed measures for 1995 contained in this rule. Based on this evaluation, NMFS is concerned whether these
proposed measures will adequately constrain recreational catches to the level of the sector's allocation in 1995.
This recent evaluation shows a clear increasing trend in the proportion of trips to offshore waters that are returning
with red snapper that may, in part, result in recreational fishery catches well above the allocation. The Council
is expected to review this recent information on anticipated recreational fishery catches. Comments are invited
as to whether additional adjustments to bag limits and size limitations may be needed to meet stock recovery goals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to changes in recreational fishery measures, the Council recommended, and NMFS is proposing, a delay
in the opening of the commercial fishery for red snapper until February 24, 1995. The proposed delayed opening date
was requested by fishermen to help ensure that the fishery would remain open during the entire Lenten season when there
is a higher demand for fresh fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council's recommended changes are within the scope of the management measures that may be adjusted by the framework
procedure for adjusting management measures referred to at 50 CFR 641.28 and specified in the FMP. The Director, Southeast
Region, NMFS, initially concurs that the Council's recommended changes are consistent with the objectives of the
FMP, the national standards for fishery conservation and management and other provisions of the Magnuson Fishery
Conservation and Management Act, and other applicable law. Accordingly, the Council's recommended changes are
published by NMFS as a proposed rule for public comment.

Minority Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A minority report signed by five Council members raises several objections to the proposed red snapper management
measures, including alleged deficiencies in fishery data supporting the Council's recommendations and an alleged
inadequate assessment of the impacts of bag limit reductions on headboat and charter vessel operators and crew. The
report does not object to the delayed opening of the commercial red snapper season. Copies of the minority report are
available (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). NMFS is considering and reviewing the minority report. Any final rule implementing the approved measures in the
regulatory amendment will respond to comments on the proposed rule received by NMFS during the 15-day comment period,
including the issues raised in the Council's minority report.

This proposed rule was determined to be not significant under E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has determined that the proposed change in the red snapper bag limit and the restriction on the allowable harvest
of red snapper for headboat and charter vessel captains and crew could affect more than 5 percent of gross for-hire
commercial revenues. As a result, the proposed action could cause a significant impact on a substantial number of
small entities, and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis was prepared. A copy of this analysis is available
(see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS is proposing a 15-day comment period on this rule, as opposed to a maximum of 30 days allowed under the FMP's framework
procedure, in order to provide an opportunity for participation by the public while ensuring that the proposed measures,
if adopted in final, can be implemented by January 1, 1995, the beginning of the new fishing year.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act, as amended by Public Law 101&hyph;549, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the Act),
authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) to establish the Acid Rain Program. On January 11,
1993, the Agency promulgated final rules under title IV. Several parties filed petitions for review of the rules.
On August 10, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing certain substitution plan issues.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on a review of the record, the Agency concludes that the January 11, 1993 regulations concerning the eligibility
of units to be designated as substitution units should be revised. Under sections 404(b) and (c) of the Act, a unit that
is not listed in Table A of section 404 as being subject to Phase I of the Acid Rain Program (i.e., a non-Table A unit) and
that is under the control of the owner or operator of a unit listed in Table A of section 404 (i.e., a Table A unit) may be
designated as a substitution unit. The January 11, 1993 regulations state that the Table A unit and each non-Table
A unit that the Table A unit designates as a substitution unit must have ``the same owner or operator.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is proposing to revise the regulations in order to specify more clearly the circumstances under which the
statutory ``control'' requirement for substitution plans is met. Because the rule revision is consistent with the
August 10, 1994 settlement and the Agency does not anticipate receiving adverse comments, the revision is also being
issued as a direct final rule in the final rules section of this

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to alter the Los Angeles, CA, Class B airspace area. This proposal would lower the ceiling of the
Los Angeles Class B airspace area from 12,500 feet mean sea level (MSL) to 10,000 feet MSL; raise the base altitude west
of Santa Monica, CA, from 4,000 feet MSL to 7,000 feet MSL to provide for more airspace for uncontrolled traffic to navigate
outside of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area; and expand the eastern, southern and southeastern boundaries for
additional airspace for the arrival of high performance aircraft. This action would improve aviation traffic flow
and enhance safety in the Los Angeles area while accommodating the concerns of airspace users.

On May 21, 1970, the FAA published Amendment 91&hyph;78 to part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (35 FR 7782)
which provided for the establishment of Terminal Control Areas (TCA's).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 21, 1988, the FAA published a final rule which requires Mode C equipment when operating within 30 nautical miles
of any designated TCA primary airport from the surface up to 10,000 feet MSL, except for those aircraft not originally
certified with an engine driven electrical system or which have not subsequently been certified with such a system
installed (53 FR 23356).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 14, 1988, the FAA published a final rule that revised the classification and pilot/equipment requirements
for conducting operations in a TCA (53 FR 40318). Specifically, the rule: (a) Established a single-class TCA; (b)
requires the pilot in command of a civil aircraft operating within a TCA to hold at least a private pilot certificate,
except for a student pilot who has received certain documented training; and (c) eliminated the helicopter exception
from the minimum navigational equipment requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 17, 1991, the FAA published a final rule on airspace reclassification (56 FR 65655) of those airspace designations
described in part 71 of the FAR. As a result of this reclassification, that airspace formerly referred to as the Los
Angeles, CA, Terminal Control Area was reclassified to the Los Angeles, CA, Class B airspace, effective September
16, 1993.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Class B airspace (TCA prior to September 16, 1993) program was developed to reduce the midair collision potential
in the congested airspace surrounding airports with high density air traffic by providing an area in which all aircraft
will be subject to certain operating rules and equipment requirements. The density of traffic and the type of operations
being conducted in the airspace surrounding major terminals increase the probability of midair collisions. In 1970,
an extensive study found that the majority of midair collisions occurred between a general aviation (GA) aircraft
and an air carrier, military or another GA aircraft. The basic causal factor common to these conflicts was the mix of
uncontrolled aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR) and controlled aircraft operating under instrument
flight rules (IFR). Class B airspace areas provide a method to accommodate the increasing number of IFR and VFR operations.
The regulatory requirements of Class B airspace areas afford the greatest protection for the greatest number of people
by giving air traffic control (ATC) increased capability to provide aircraft separation service, thereby minimizing
the mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft. To date, the FAA has established a total of 29 Class B airspace area
designations. The FAA is proposing to take action to modify or implement additional Class B airspace areas to provide
greater protection of air traffic in the airspace regions most commonly used by passenger-carrying aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Class B airspace areas are published in Paragraph 3000 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September
16, 1994. The Class B airspace area listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The standard configuration of a Class B airspace area consists of 3 concentric circles centered on the primary airport
extending to 10, 20, and 30 nautical miles respectively. The vertical limits of the Class B airspace area should normally
not exceed 10,000 feet MSL, with the floor established at the surface in the inner area and at levels appropriate for
operations in the outer areas. Variations of these criteria may be authorized contingent upon terrain, adjacent
regulatory airspace, and other factors unique to the area.

on April 22, 1992, pre-NPRM airspace meetings were held on June 23, 25, 30 and July 1, 1992, at Brentwood, San Diego,
Los Alamitos, and Walnut, California, respectively, to encourage the public and airspace users to participate in
developing the design for the Los Angeles Class B airspace area modification 57 FR 14670. Comments on this proposed
modification were provided by private citizens, local government agencies, user groups, and local airport authorities.
These comments were considered in the proposed modification of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pilot groups were concerned more about the aviation aspects of the proposal, while some homeowners were more concerned
with the non-aviation aspects. Lowering the ceiling of the proposed airspace from 12,500 to 10,000 feet MSL generated
positive response from most pilots, because pilots would be able to overfly the Class B airspace area and descend south
of the Class B airspace area while conforming to the mode C requirement. Some homeowners viewed this modification
negatively. Current flight tracks bring aircraft over their homes, and lowering the ceiling of the proposed airspace
would bring these aircraft in closer proximity to their homes. It should be noted that this proposed action does not
propose a change to these flight tracks, as they now exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both groups had positive comments on raising the floor in the Malibu area to provide additional VFR operations. Expansion
of the Class B airspace boundaries generated conflicting comments. Homeowners saw the regulatory airspace as growing
for no reason, while pilots viewed the growth of regulatory airspace as providing additional controlled airspace
for high performance aircraft from the east, southeast and south. Other comments are discussed below in the ``Proposal''
section.

The Proposal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the existing Los Angeles
Class B airspace area, based on safety and operational needs. The FAA's responsibility is to manage efficiently and
safely the airspace surrounding the Los Angeles area. This proposal would lower the ceiling of the Los Angeles Class
B airspace area from 12,500 feet mean seal level (MSL) to 10,000 feet MSL; raise the base altitude west of Santa Monica,
CA, from 4,000 feet MSL to 7,000 feet MSL to provide more airspace for uncontrolled traffic to navigate outside of the
Los Angeles Class B airspace area; and expand the eastern, southern and southeastern boundaries for additional controlled
airspace for the high performance aircraft. The proposed alteration is depicted in the attached chart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following proposed modifications of the Los Angeles Class B airspace area are as follows:

This change is necessary because of the concentration of high performance aircraft operating very close to the surface
as they arrive and depart Los Angeles International (LAX), the Class B airspace primary airport. The proposed modification,
which incorporates the suggestion made by the Southern California Airspace User's Group to relocate the boundary
of the area, would reduce the area size to the north of Los Angeles, thereby enabling aircraft utilizing the VFR Special
Flight Rules Area to enter the traffic pattern sooner for the Santa Monica Airport. Additionally, this would allow
aircraft at Santa Monica Airport to enter the traffic pattern at a more reasonable altitude. General aviation user
groups actively supported this modification with the assurance that the VFR Special Flight Rules Area would remain
available for transition through the Class B airspace.

The number of turboprop aircraft operating at LAX has increased. The proposed modification would accommodate the
requirement to contain turboprop operations within the Class B airspace area, segregating them from jet operations.
Overwater portions of this area, used by VFR traffic for banner tows and low level sightseeing, would not be adversely
affected by this change.

from the Class B airspace. This will make navigation simpler and reduce the probability of an inadvertent Class B airspace
violation. Currently, Area D contains a portion of V&hyph;186 from 4,000 feet to 12,500 feet MSL and is located 20 to
25 miles east of Los Angeles. V&hyph;186 is a primary route used for VFR navigation around the Los Angeles Class B airspace.
To remain clear of the Class B airspace, VFR aircraft must navigate north of this airway. Navigation in this area is
difficult for VFR traffic because of the rising terrain.

With regard to Areas E and F, arrival traffic to Los Angeles from the east descends on the CIVET Southern California
Terminal Airspace Realignment (STAR) arrival profile. This allows aircraft to descend on the glideslope, approximately
50 miles from the airport. This is the busiest route in the Los Angeles Basin. Traffic on this route must descend through
an area surrounded by numerous VFR flyways with a mix of IFR traffic arriving, departing, and overflying the various
airports in the Los Angeles Basin. Because of the analysis of near midair collision reports (NMAC), concern exists
regarding the airspace between the outer boundary of the current Class B airspace and the Ontario Class C airspace,
approximately 35 miles east of Los Angeles. In this area, high performance aircraft are descending out of 10,000 feet
MSL, and VFR aircraft are navigating around the Class B airspace. This proposal would provide additional airspace
for large jet aircraft within the Class B airspace area. Terrain features would be used to provide an easily discernible
boundary to assist VFR aircraft in avoiding the Class B airspace. The extension of the Class B airspace area between
25 nautical miles (NM) and 35 NM east provides additional airspace for high performance aircraft in the Class B airspace
area and provides better separation from other aircraft operating near the Class B airspace.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With regard to Areas G, H, I, and J, major airspace modifications are proposed because of the implementation of the
STAR (Southern California Terminal Airspace Realignment) plan and the resultant increase in the traffic routed
inbound to LAX from the south. The Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) sequences traffic from
Asia and the Pacific arriving over the Santa Catalina Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation
(VORTAC) with arrival traffic from Mexico, South America, and San Diego routed over the Seal Beach VORTAC (SLI). It
is important that this traffic descend in a timely manner, as delays could affect the eastbound departure traffic.
To facilitate this mix of traffic, the proposed Areas G, H, and I are designed to facilitate both the arrival and departure
traffic without interfering with existing VFR routes. Area G would allow aircraft arriving from the south to remain
within the Class B airspace as they descend to the final approach course. Depicted VFR flyways at 3,500 and 4,500 feet
MSL will remain unaffected. Area H would allow VFR aircraft to climb eastbound, east of the Seal Beach VORTAC, while
enabling Los Angeles approach to utilize altitudes compatible with the final approach course. Area I has been proposed
using geographical coordinates and terrain features to facilitate the efficient use of this airspace. Area J would
allow VFR flight at 7,500 feet MSL which user input indicated was a commonly used altitude for VFR flight to and from
Santa Catalina. This proposed area would not eliminate established VFR transition routes.

The proposed Area N modification would allow for more airspace for aircraft departing LAX and would allow aircraft,
northbound over Santa Monica, to execute an earlier turn westbound. Additionally, this change would benefit VFR
operations by providing additional airspace for uncontrolled VFR aircraft to overfly Point Dume, CA.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive Order
12866, and therefore no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with the Department
of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the anticipated costs and benefits, which are summarized
below. For more detailed economic information, see the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefit-Cost Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would improve aviation traffic flow and enhance aviation safety by altering Class B airspace in and around
LAX while accommodating the legitimate concerns of airspace users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that there would be little or no costs associated with implementation of the proposed modification
to the LAX Class B airspace area to either the agency or aircraft operators. The determination for each potential cost
is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would not impose any additional administrative costs on the FAA for either personnel or equipment.
The additional operations workload generated by the proposed rule would be absorbed by current personnel and equipment
resources which are already in place. The cost of revising aeronautical charts to reflect the change of the airspace
would not add to the normal requirement of routine and periodic updating of the charts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aircraft operating in the vicinity of the proposed expanded Los Angeles Class B airspace area should already have
two-way radio communications capability because the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area is surrounded by
Class C and D airspace areas. Thus, little if any, additional communication equipment should be required by this proposal.
To minimize any radio installation costs that may occur, the FAA would provide cutouts along the floor of the proposed
expanded Class B airspace area. In addition, procedural agreements between ATC and affected satellite airports
could be used to avoid imposing radio installation costs on operators at these airports. Additionally, the cost to
pilots who avoid the Los Angeles Class B airspace area should not increase significantly. Only small deviations from
the current flight paths would be required to avoid the proposed expanded Los Angeles Class B airspace area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ordinarily, aircraft operating in and above the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area would be required to have
Mode C transponders as a result of the Mode C rule. However, all of the airspace that would be included in the proposed
expanded Class B airspace area lies entirely within the Los Angeles Mode C Veil centered around LAX. Therefore, the
FAA contends that all aircraft operating in or above the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area already have Mode
C transponders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is expected to generate benefits primarily in the form of improved traffic flow while enhancing
safety. Enhancements to safety come in the lowered risk of midair collisions (despite the rise in traffic density)
due to the increased ATC control of the modified airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule would benefit GA aircraft operators by reducing the size of the various subareas of the Class B airspace
area, thus increasing usable airspace for GA aircraft. Additionally, it would simplify the airspace and reduce possible
pilot confusion. Also, areas B and C would be reduced to allow more airspace with less restrictions for emergency response
aircraft.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the minimal cost of compliance versus enhancements to aviation safety and efficiency, the FAA has determined
that the proposed rule is cost-beneficial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review proposed rules which may have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities which could be potentially affected
by the implementation of this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire owning nine or fewer aircraft.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only those unscheduled aircraft operators without the capability to operate under IFR conditions would be potentially
impacted by the proposed rule. The FAA believes that all of the potentially impacted unscheduled aircraft operators
are already equipped to operate under IFR conditions. This is because such operators fly regularly in airports where
radar approach control services have been established. Therefore, the FAA believes this proposed rule would have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The proposed rule would neither have an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor would it have an effect on the sale of United States products or services in foreign countries. The proposed rule

This proposed rule would not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685; October 30, 1987), it is determined that this proposed
rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

For reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and
the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory
action'' under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant
economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act. This regulation is not considered significant under Order DOT 2100.5, Policies and Procedures
for Simplification, Analysis and Review of Regulations. A final regulatory evaluation of the proposed regulation,
including a final Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis has been placed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 7 CFR Part 1944, Subpart N provides details on what information must be contained in the preapplication package. Entities

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic assistance under No. 10.443, Housing Preservation Grants.
This program is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation
with State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V; 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983). Applicants are also referred
to 7 CFR Part 1944, Sections 1944.674 and 1944.676 (d) and (e) for specific guidance on these requirements relative
to the HPG program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The funding instrument for the HPG program will be a grant agreement. The term of the grant can vary from 1 to 2 years,
depending on available funds and demand. No maximum or minimum grant levels have been set, although based on fiscal
year (FY) 1993 and FY 94 experience, the Agency anticipates that the average grant will be between $100,000 and $150,000
for 1 year proposal. For FY 95, $22,000,000 is available and has been distributed under a formula allocation to States
pursuant to 7 CFR Part 1940, Subpart L, ``Methodology and Formulas for Allocation of Loan and Grant Funds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decisions on funding will be based on the preapplications, and notices of action on the preapplications should be
made no earlier than 66 days prior to the closing date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request by the petitioners, domestic producers of standard pipe products, the Department of Commerce
(the Department) is conducting an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded
carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand. The review period is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. This review involves one manufacturer/exporter of this merchandise to
the United States, Saha Thai Steel Pipe Company, Ltd. (Saha Thai). As a result of the review, we have preliminarily
determined that dumping margins exist with respect to this manufacturer/exporter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 11, 1986, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the antidumping duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (51 FR 8341). On March
12, 1993, the Department published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notifying interested parties of the opportunity to request an administrative review of certain circular welded
carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (57 FR 13583). On March 30, 1993, the domestic producers (Allied Tube &amp;
Conduit Corporation, Sawhill Tubular Division of Armco, Inc., American Tube Company, Inc., Laclede Steel Company,
Sharon Tube Company, Wheatland Tube Company, and Eagle Pipe Company) requested, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)
of the Department's regulations, that we conduct an administrative review for the period March 1, 1992, through February
28, 1993. We published a notice of initiation of the antidumping duty administrative review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is now conducting a review for this period in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as
amended (the Act).

Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this administrative review are shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and
tubes from Thailand. The subject merchandise has an outside diameter of 0.375 inch or more, but not exceeding 16 inches.
These products, which are commonly referred to in the industry as ``standard pipe'' or ``structural tubing,'' are
hereinafter designated as ``pipe and tube.'' The merchandise is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) item numbers 7306.30.1000, 7306.30.5025, 7306.30.5032, 7306.30.5040, 7306.30.5055, 7306.30.5085, and
7306.30.5090. The item numbers are provided for convenience and U.S. Customs Service purposes. The written description
remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review covers shipments made by Saha Thai from Thailand to the United States during the period of review March 1,
1992, through February 28, 1993 (POR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating U.S. price (USP), the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because
the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. Purchase price was based on the packed
FOB or C&amp;F price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. The review included all of Saha Thai's U.S. sales
that entered the United States during the POR. We made deductions from the unit price, where applicable, for ocean
freight, bank charges, foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, and customs clearing expenses (brokerage).
We made an addition to USP for duty drawback. Additionally, we adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice
as outlined in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 31204, June 17, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No other adjustments to USP were claimed or allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of pipe and tube in the home market to serve as a viable basis
for calculating foreign market value (FMV), we compared the volume of home market sales to the volume of third-country
sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Saha Thai had sufficient home market sales of the subject
merchandise during the POR. Thus, we based FMV on Saha Thai's sales in the home market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not include home market sales of pipe and tube made to the specifications of the American Society for Testing
and Materials (ASTM pipe) in our FMV calculation because we determined that such sales were outside the ordinary course
of trade. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 19 U.S.C. 1677(15) and 1677b(a)(1). Rather, we included only sales of pipe and tube made to British Standard specifications
(BS pipe). In determining that Saha Thai's sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of
trade, we did not rely on one factor taken in isolation, but rather considered all the circumstances particular to
the sales in question. In reviewing the evidence for this review, we based our decision upon (1) the different standards
and product uses of ASTM pipes and BS pipes; and (2) the comparative volume of sales and number of buyers of ASTM pipes
and BS pipes in the home market during the POR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Saha Thai indicated that the ASTM pipes sold in the home market during the POR were produced on the basis of special orders
or special projects in which the entire project was supplied with ASTM standard pipes. In addition, ASTM pipes and
BS pipes cannot be coupled together. Therefore, ASTM pipe cannot be used in most pipe systems in Thailand and cannot
be used to replace most existing pipe systems in Thailand. Finally, sales of ASTM pipe constituted a small volume of
total Saha Thai's sales of pipe and tube in the home market, and the customers purchasing ASTM pipe in the home market
were limited primarily to new, stand-alone government projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we determined that sales of ASTM pipe in the home market were outside the ordinary course of trade, and
therefore did not use these sales in our calculation of FMV.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on findings in the 1988&hyph;89 review that home market sales of the subject merchandise were made by Saha Thai
at prices below the cost of production (COP), the Department conducted a cost investigation in this review. In accordance
with section 773(b) of the Act, and 19 CFR 353.51 of the Department's regulations, we examined whether home market
sales were made below cost and in substantial quantities over an extended period of time, and whether such sales were
made at prices which permitted recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade.
We calculated Saha Thai's COP as the sum of all reported materials costs, labor expenses, factory overhead, and general
and selling expenses for the three types of pipe and tube that were sold in the home market during the POR (galvanized
plain-end, black plain-end, and galvanized threaded-and-coupled). We compared COP to home market prices net of
discounts, foreign inland freight, and an adjusted business tax, or value-added tax, depending on the time of sale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each model where less than 10 percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POR were made at prices below
the COP, we included all sales of that model in the computation of FMV. For each model where 10 percent or more, but less
than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POR were priced below the merchandise's COP, we excluded from the
calculation of FMV those home market sales which were below the merchandise's COP, provided that these below-cost
sales were made over an extended period of time. For each model where 90 percent or more of the home market sales during
the POR were priced below the COP and were made over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales of that model
from our calculation of FMV and used the constructed value (CV) of those models as described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months
in which sales below cost occurred for a particular type of pipe and tube to the number of months in which that type was
sold. If the type was sold in fewer than three months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there were below-cost
sales of that type in each month sold. If a type was sold in three or more months, we did not disregard below-cost sales
unless there were sales below cost in at least three of the months in which the type was sold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since Saha Thai has not submitted any information indicating that any of its sales below cost were at prices which would
have permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,'' as required
by section 773(b)(2) of the Act, we are unable to conclude that the costs of production of such sales have been recovered
within a reasonable period. As a result, we disregarded below-cost sales made over an extended period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the remaining sales, the Department calculated FMV on a monthly weighted-average basis. Home market prices
were based on the price to unrelated purchasers. Where applicable, we made adjustments for transportation discounts,
foreign inland freight, packing expenses, and business tax, or value-added tax, depending on the date of sale. We
also made adjustments to FMV for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, packing, credit
expenses, and warranty expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used CV as FMV to compare to those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient home market sales at or above the COP.
Pursuant to section 773(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.50(a) of the Department's regulations, CV consisted of the
sum of materials, overhead, labor, U.S. packing, general and administrative expenses, and profit for each of the
four types of pipe and tube sold in the United States during the POR (black plain-end, galvanized plain-end, galvanized
threaded-and-coupled, and black threaded-and-coupled). Since Saha Thai's actual selling, general, and administrative
expenses (SG&amp;A) and actual profits were greater than the statutory minima for SG&amp;A and profit as provided
in section 773(e)(1)(B) of the Act, we used the SG&amp;A and profit reported by Saha Thai. We adjusted CV for selling,
credit, and packing expenses.

Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 days of publication of this notice and any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of publication. Any
hearing, if requested, will be held 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Interested
parties may submit case briefs and/or written comments not later than 30 days after the date of publication. Rebuttal
briefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues raised in such briefs or comments, may be filed not later
than 37 days after the date of publication. The Department will publish a notice of the final results of this administrative
review, which will include the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such briefs or comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall determine, and the U.S. Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate
entries. Individual differences between USP and FMV may vary from the percentage stated above. The Department will
issue appraisement instructions directly to the U.S. Customs Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective upon completion of the final results of this administrative
review for all shipments of certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand, entered or withdrawn
from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this administrative review,
as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for Saha Thai will be that established in the final
results of this review; (2) for merchandise exported by manufacturers or exporters not covered in this review but
covered in the original less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or previous reviews, the cash deposit will continue
to be the rate published in the final determination or the last final results for which the manufacturer or exporter
received a company-specific rate; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, or the original LTFV investigation,
but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be that established for the manufacturer of the merchandise in
the final results of this review, a previous review, or the original investigation; and (4) if neither the exporter
nor the manufacturer is a firm covered in this or any previous review, the cash deposit rate will be the ``all others
rate'' from the LTFV investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 25, 1993, the Court of International Trade (CIT), in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Floral Trade Council v. United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 822 F. Supp. 766 (CIT 1993), and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal-Mogul Corporation and the Torrington Company v. United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 822 F. Supp. 782 (CIT 1993), decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed
through an administrative review. The Department has determined that, in order to implement these decisions, it
is appropriate to reinstate the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended
for correction for clerical errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders
for the purposes of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping duty order, the ``all others'' rate for the purposes of this
review will be 15.67 percent, the ``all others'' rate established in the Department's final determination of sales
at LTFV (51 FR 3384, January 27, 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a countervailing duty order on certain circular welded carbon steel pipes and tubes from Thailand (50 FR 32751,
August 15, 1985). In accordance with section 772(d)(1)(D) of the Act, entries subject to both antidumping duties
and countervailing duties will not be assessed antidumping duties on the portion of the margin attributable to export
subsidies. Because the amount of countervailing duties to be imposed on entries during the POR has yet to be determined,
we cannot at this time make the appropriate adjustment. However, to ensure that the appropriate adjustment is made,
upon issuing our final results of the administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs not to assess antidumping
duties on the margin attributable to export subsidies for the POR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice also serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file
a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during
this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary of the Department's presumption
that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

 On July 27, 1994, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated antidumping duty investigations of oil country

Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a) requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects of
a computer matching program between DOE and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The record subjects
are DOE delinquent debtors who may be current or former Federal employees receiving Federal salary or benefit payments
and who are delinquent in their repayment of debts owed to the United States Government under programs administered
by DOE so as to permit DOE to pursue and collect the debt by voluntary repayment or by administrative or salary offset
procedures under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the DMDC and DOE have concluded an
agreement to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal
data between the agencies for debt collection. The match will yield the identity and location of the debtors within
the Federal government so that DOE can pursue recoupment of the debt by voluntary payment or by administrative or salary
offset procedures. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A copy of the computer matching agreement between DOE and DMDC is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Department of Energy, Office of Financial Policy, 1000 Independence
Agency, SW, Washington, DC 20585. Telephone (202) 856&hyph;4860.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below is the notice of the establishment of a computer matching program required by paragraph 6.c. of the
Office of Management and Budget Guidelines on computer matching published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The matching agreement, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of this notice was submitted
on November 9, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A&hyph;130, `Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals,' dated July 15, 1994 (59 FR 37906, July 25, 1994). The matching program
is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.

Purpose of the match: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon the execution of an agreement, the DOE will provide and disclose debtor records to DMDC to identify and locate
any matched Federal personnel, employed or retired, who may owe delinquent debts to the Federal Government under
certain programs administered by the DOD. The DOE will use this information to initiate independent collection of
those debts under the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 when voluntary payment is not forthcoming. These
collection efforts will include requests by the DOE of any employing Federal agency to apply administrative and/or
salary offset procedures until such time as the obligation is paid in full.

Description of computer matching program: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE, as the source agency, will provide DMDC with a diskette which contains the names of delinquent debtors in programs
the DOE administers. Upon receipt of the diskette file of debtor accounts, DMDC will perform a computer match using
all nine digits of the SSN of the DOE file against a DMDC computer database. The DMDC database, established under an
interagency agreement between DOD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records
of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Matching records (`hits'), based on the SSN, will
produce the member's name, service or agency, category of employee, and current work or home address. The hits or matches
will be furnished to the DOE. The DOE is responsible for verifying and determining that the data on the DMDC reply diskette
file are consistent with the DOE source file and for resolving any discrepancies or inconsistencies on an individual
basis. The DOE will also be responsible for making final determinations as to positive identification, amount of
indebtedness and recovery efforts as a result of the match.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diskette provided by DOE will contain data elements of the debtor's name, Social Security Number, debtor status
and debt balance, internal account numbers and the total amount owed on approximately 64 delinquent debtors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DMDC computer database file contains approximately 10 million records of active duty and retired military members,
including the Reserve and Guard, and the OPM government wide Federal civilian records of current and retired Federal
employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DMDC will match the SSN on the DOE diskette by computer against the DMDC database. Matching records, hits based on SSN,
will produce data elements of the member's name, SSN, service or agency, and current work or home address.

 notice with no significant adverse public comments in receipt resulting in a contrary determination, then this computer
matching program becomes effective and the respective agencies may begin the exchange of data 30 days after the date
of this published notice at a mutually agreeable time and will be repeated annually. Under no circumstances shall
the matching program be implemented before the 30 day public notice period for comment has elapsed as this time period
cannot be waived. By agreement between DOE and DMDC, the matching program will be in effect and continue for 18 months
with an option to renew for 12 additional months unless one of the parties to the agreement advises the other by written
request to terminate or modify the agreement.

<DOCTITLE>Record of Decision for Realignment of Carswell Air Force Base to Naval Air Station Fort Worth, Fort Worth, TX</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 and the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations for implementing NEPA procedures (40 CFR 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces
its decision to implement realignment of Carswell Air Force Base (AFB) to Naval Air Station (NAS) Fort Worth Joint
Reserve Base (JRB), Fort Worth, Texas. In accordance with the legislative requirements of the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Act of 1990 [Public Law (P.L.) 101&hyph;510), the 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission
(BRAC&hyph;93) recommended the closure of NAS Dallas, Texas, NAS Memphis, Tennessee, and NAS Glenview, Illinois.
Assets and operations from each of these bases were directed to be relocated to the former Carswell AFB, which closed
September 30, 1993 pursuant to a BRAC&hyph;91 decision. The former Carswell AFB is to be realigned to become the Naval
Air Station Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base (JRB).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In compliance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations, the Department of the Navy acted as a Cooperating
Agency with the Department of the Air Force and had substantial involvement in drafting and reviewing an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) for the disposal and reuse of Carswell AFB. The EIS presented a full description of the projects
and environmental impacts associated with the Navy realignment actions. In addition, the Navy planned actions were
presented at the Draft EIS Public Hearing hosted by the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Navy has conducted
an independent review of the EIS and adopts the EIS for purposes of its proposed actions. This Record of Decision announces
Navy's decision to implement actions described in the FEIS for the realignment and operation of NAS Fort Worth JRB,
Fort Worth, Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Draft EIS was prepared for the proposed reuse and disposal actions and distributed to federal, state, and local agencies
and to interested individuals and groups in February 1993. The DEIS was revised to include the Navy as a cooperating
agency when the BRAC&hyph;93 decision to realign Carswell AFB was made. The revised DEIS was published and distributed
in March 1994. A public hearing was held on April 4, 1994 in the City of Fort Worth, Texas. Responses to all public comments
received were incorporated in an FEIS that was distributed in July 1994. The proposed Navy realignment action would
incorporate approximately 1,869 acres from the former Carswell AFB for reuse as NAS Fort Worth JRB. The realignment
of the base would consist of renovation of approximately 120 buildings and new construction of an additional 25 facilities,
in addition to the demolition of some facilities that are not cost effective to reuse or renovate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The realignment also includes upgrades of base utilities to accommodate JRB requirements. Upgrades to the airfield
stormwater drainage will also be incorporated into the realignment plans. An estimated total of 24 acres of land will
need to be distributed for new construction activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed operations of the NAS Fort Worth JRB will be primarily air operations by reserve forces. Some smaller
non-air units will also be attached to the base. Reserve units from the Navy, Marine corps, Air Force, Texas Air National
Guard, and Army National Guard will be operating at the base. The various types of aircraft that will be normally at
the base will include F&hyph;14s, F/A&hyph;18s, F&hyph;16s, KC&hyph;130s, C&hyph;130s, C&hyph;9s, C&hyph;12s,
U&hyph;21s, CH&hyph;47s, UH&hyph;60s and a UH&hyph;1. An estimated 95,000 annual air operations are associated
with the various proposed military aircraft, including transient military aircraft. All of the existing airspace
and air traffic control services associated with previous Air Force operations will be retained for use by the JRB.
The combination of closure and realignment will reduce military air traffic in the area and significantly reduce
potential civilian-military aircraft conflicts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 2,100 active duty military personnel are expected to be attached to the JRB. An additional 1,400 civilian
personnel will be employed at the base. Approximately 8,500 reservists or guardsmen will drill at the JRB on schedules
that will attempt to spread the numbers equally over three weekends each month.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The realignment and establishment of NAS Fort Worth JRB will occur, as mandated by P.L. 101&hyph;510, regardless
of the disposal and reuse of the remaining portions of Carswell AFB. Therefore, these military land areas and reuse
activities were incorporated as part of the No-Action alternative and all reuse alternatives for analysis in the
EIS. Maximum consideration was given to the use of existing structures to minimize environmental impacts and construction
costs for realignment. Sites considered at NAS Fort Worth JRB for the proposed new facilities avoided environmentally
sensitive areas and were selected based on functional considerations, adequacy of existing structures for the proposed
uses, availability of utilities, proximity to existing facilities, and observing all airfield safety and noise
criteria. The proposed action will cause no significant impact to ambient air quality levels. Localized, temporary
impacts would occur during construction and demolition activities. Compliance with state and federal regulations,
including National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS), will be achieved during any removal
of asbestos-containing materials.

NAS Fort Worth JRB is located in a non-attainment area for ozone. An applicability analysis was performed for air pollutant
emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in compliance with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the 1993 General
Conformity Rule for determining conformity of federal actions to state or federal implementation plans (40 CFR Parts
6, 51, and 93). The analysis included construction-related emissions, mobile-source emissions, and stationary-source
emissions associated with the proposed action. Neither NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nor VOC emissions estimates for any year of the proposed action exceeded the de minimis levels of 100 tons per year established
by the General Conformity Rule. The proposed action was determined to conform to the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
and is exempted from any further requirements of the General Conformity Rule. The Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) has reviewed the applicability analysis presented in the FEIS and has approved the air permit
application resulting in the issuance of a construction permit to the Navy.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An aircraft noise study was conducted to analyze the effects of noise patterns associated with JRB operations as compared
to the previous operations at Carswell AFB. The area exposed to sound level DNL 65 dB or greater is expected to decrease
by approximately 2,605 acres and affect 2,300 fewer residents than the previous Air Force aircraft noise impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No significant degradation of levels of service for on-base or off-base road systems are expected as a result of the
proposed action. Current utilities to the base are of sufficient capacity to provide anticipated services. Utility
lines within the base infrastructure will be upgraded in some locations where additional fire protection, natural
gas, sanitary sewer, or electrical services are required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The local economy will not encounter any significant impacts from the proposed action. NAS Forth Worth JRB will initially
reuse 83 units of family housing on-base. An estimated 3,939 housing units within the local communities will be vacated
as a result of the closure of Carswell AFB. An estimated 1,196 housing units will be required to accommodate the in-migration
of permanent personnel associated with the JRB. Based on this projected in-migration, 281 new students will enroll
in the area's various school districts; this number is less than the decreases experienced in each of the last three
years as a result of the Carswell AFB closure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean-up on identified installation restoration program (IRP) sites will continue regardless of the reuse or disposal
plans. The Departments of the Navy and Air Force have entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to identify which department
will continue the management of the clean-up program and provide the funding requirements. The two Departments have
agreed to finalize program arrangements by October 1, 1995. In the interim, the Air Force Base Conversion Agency (AFBCA)
will continue to administer the program. New construction and renovations requiring excavations will be closely
coordinated with the IRP project manager to avoid any impacts to IRP sites or construction plans and maintain the health
and safety of contractor personnel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy will institute a hazardous material minimization program at NAS Fort Worth JRB by issuing hazardous materials
in increments for daily consumption to the various departments and users on base. The hazardous waste storage facility
currently permitted under a Part B permit by the State of Texas will continued to be used as a permitted facility for
the storage of generated hazardous wastes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AFBCA has identified all underground storage tanks that were in place at Carswell AFB. Navy design teams are evaluating
what tanks are required for continued support to facilities planned for reuse. These tanks will be inspected and certified
for use in accordance with all applicable underground storage tank regulations. The AFBCA is continuing with efforts
to remove all other tanks not planned for reuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action would result in no significant impacts to plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered
by either federal or state agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has concurred in this conclusion. No impacts
to wetlands will be experienced as a result of new construction. Minor impacts to floodplains will be mitigated through
the construction of improved storm water drainage and handling systems. The estimated 24 acres of disturbance from
new construction will have minimal impacts to biological resources because of adjacencies to current airfield/industrial
operations and the already existing built-up conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential impacts to cultural resources at NAS Fort Worth JRB have been evaluated in compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Renovations are proposed for two buildings (Building 1430 and 4175)
that have been identified as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The exterior renovations to Building
1430 will include the installation of a new roof. Interior renovations will include movement of office walls added
to the facility during earlier Air Force interior renovations. Building 4575 will undergo major interior renovations
to adapt this alert crew facility to a squadron operations building. Exterior renovations will include removal and
demolition of surrounding equipment, addition of some windows, and altering some facility points of ingress/egress.
All proposed modifications to these buildings will be coordinated with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) during
project design. The Navy is proposing to the THC, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the acknowledgment, operation,
and maintenance of eligible historic structures on NAS Fort Worth JRB. No significant archaeological, Native American,
or paleontological resources have been identified on NAS Fort Worth JRB that would be adversely affected by the realignment
activities. In the event that archaeological, paleontological, or Native American resources are discovered during
the course of project activities, ground disturbing activities will cease in the immediate area and a qualified archaeologist
will be consulted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Purpose and Need for Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the most urgent and difficult technical tasks facing the DOE is to assess the effects of aging on the weapons that
remain in the nation's nuclear stockpile, and to ensure the continuing safety of those weapons. Because the President
has decided not to build any new nuclear weapons for the foreseeable future, but instead to continue to rely upon a smaller
stockpile of existing but aging weapons as a nuclear deterrent, DOE must ensure that the weapons remaining in the stockpile
are safe, secure and reliable. Under the Atomic Energy Act, this mission rests with DOE and essentially requires DOE
to certify that the weapons will not accidentally detonate during storage and handling, that the weapons would thwart
any attempts for unauthorized use, and that they would function as designed in the event of authorized use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To fulfill this mission, DOE needs to collect diagnostic information regarding the condition of the weapons which
remain in the enduring stockpile. Some of these weapons are approaching the end of their design life, and DOE is not
certain how they may be affected by the aging process. One important type of information that is currently lacking
concerns the three-dimensional condition of the various internal components of aging weapons. These are often shielded
by thick and dense materials. Multiple view hydrodynamic testing (experiments to look at the flow of adjacent materials
as they are driven by high explosives) and dynamic testing (experiments to study other effects of high explosives),
combined with computer modeling, provide the only means of obtaining this data in the absence of nuclear testing.
The President has endorsed hydrodynamic testing as the preferred means of conducting experiments in support of stockpile
stewardship and maintenance. Hydrodynamic testing has become more important since the United States moratorium
on nuclear testing was extended. A future Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, moreover, would foreclose the acquisition
of additional performance and safety data through nuclear testing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DARHT would be a specialized high energy X-ray machine that would take three-dimensional, sequential and high-resolution
X-ray pictures of the dynamic behavior of dense materials that are being shocked and compressed by high explosives.
DARHT would be used to evaluate the nonnuclear behavior of nuclear weapons components and would provide the nation
with a significantly improved diagnostic capability to evaluate and assess the safety and reliability of the existing
nuclear weapons stockpile. DARHT would consist of an existing support lab, a new firing site, and the necessary infrastructure,
all located at Technical Area 15 at LANL. DARHT would be used to detonate high explosives, and to use very high-speed,
tightly-focused radiographic (X-ray) photography to determine the motions (dynamic experiments) or flow (hydrodynamic
tests) of the explosive-driven materials. Two X-ray machines at right angles to each other (dual-axis lines of sight)
would be powered by two 16 million electron volt (MeV) electron accelerators, each housed in a building about 225 feet
long. By using two machines, DARHT would be able to provide three-dimensional, sequential information on occurrences
within millionths of a second during a test. The accelerators' small beam size would allow DARHT to provide a very high-quality
resolution of the radiographic image. This resolution is necessary to resolve the fine details of the material flowing
in these experiments.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DARHT experiments would variously involve radioactive materials (primarily depleted uranium), beryllium and
other hazardous materials, and other metals. Additionally, experiments involving plutonium contained in steel
vessels may be conducted. DARHT would not test materials that could result in nuclear yield, or a nuclear detonation.
Experiments at DARHT would be expected to result in metal fragments and other airborne debris being deposited up to
750 meters from the open-air explosives testing (standard operating procedures would require the evacuation of
this area before any experiments were conducted). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to testing the nonnuclear behavior of nuclear weapons components, DARHT would be used to evaluate conventional
weapons systems, explosives-driven materials for non-weapons uses, and high-velocity impact phenomena. The facility
would also be used to support non-proliferation and counter-proliferation efforts, such as experiments intended
to disable a terrorist-designed or proliferant-designed nuclear weapon. Although DARHT could be used to collect
information relevant to the design of new weapons, no new weapons are anticipated to be designed in the foreseeable
future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Design of DARHT began in the early 1980's. Memoranda to File, describing the environmental impacts of constructing
and operating DARHT, were completed in 1983 and 1987. DARHT construction began in 1988 with the Radiographic Support
Laboratory, which was completed in 1990. The Radiographic Support Laboratory is currently being used to support
the development of the accelerator equipment that is planned to be used in DARHT. In May 1994, DOE began construction
of the Hydrodynamic Firing Site. Approximately 20 percent of the Hydrodynamic Firing Site construction work (e.g.,
site preparation, foundation pouring) has been completed. Current schedules call for the Hydrodynamic Firing Site
construction to be completed, and the first X-ray machine to be operating, in 1997 at a cost of approximately $86 million,
and the second X-ray machine, if approved, would begin operation in 2000. The total estimated project cost of DARHT
in its final two-axis configuration is $124 million; to date, approximately $44 million has been spent or obligated
on the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to public concern, the DOE has decided to prepare this EIS at this time to allow for a full dialogue between
DOE and the State, tribes, other agencies and the general public regarding the environmental impacts of completing
and operating DARHT, and the impacts of other alternatives. The EIS will also assist in ensuring that appropriate
mitigation measures are developed if DARHT is completed and put into operation. Construction and related work on
the facility will continue during the preparation of the EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE has tentatively identified the following alternatives for analysis in the EIS and seeks public comment on their
adequacy, inclusiveness, and reasonableness: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Proposed action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, DOE would complete construction and operate the DARHT facility as currently planned. This
alternative would provide a state-of-the-art diagnostic capability for ensuring the safety, security and reliability
of the aging nuclear weapons stockpile. If DARHT becomes operational, operation of the Pulsed High Energy Radiation
Machine Emitting X-Rays (PHERMEX) facility, an existing facility at LANL also located at Technical Area 15, near
the DARHT site, will be phased out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) No Action (status quo) Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, DARHT would not be completed and DOE would continue to operate the Pulsed High Energy Radiation
Machine Emitting X-Rays and the Flash X-Ray facility at the Department's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
Site 300 located near Livermore, California. The Pulsed High Energy Radiation Machine Emitting X-Rays, a single-axis
radiographic facility, was built in the mid-1960's and has been used continuously since that time. It uses a pulsed
power accelerator to power the X-ray machine, and does not have the small beam size (tight focus) planned for DARHT,
thereby precluding the high-resolution images that DARHT would provide. Flash X-Ray, also a single-axis radiographic
facility, was built in 1982 and has been used continuously since that time. It uses a linear induction accelerator
to power the X-ray machine and also does not have the small beam size planned for DARHT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Containment Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, DOE would modify the construction and/or operation of DARHT to contain some or all airborne
emissions of fragments or other debris. Under one approach, the X-ray pictures would be taken through the walls of
a containment vessel. Another approach would be to construct a building to enclose and contain the explosive experiments;
X-ray pictures would be taken within the containment building. These two approaches may be considered separately
or together, for some tests or for all tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Institutional Control Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, DOE would complete and operate DARHT, but would limit use of the facility to exclude any applications
involving experiments with plutonium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Single-Axis Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative DOE would complete construction of the Hydrodynamic Firing Site but would operate only a single
axis of DARHT with one accelerator. This alternative would provide an improved technical capability over present
accelerators with a single view (i.e., the Pulsed High Energy Radiation Machine Emitting X-Rays and Flash X-Ray).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Upgrade Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative DOE would upgrade the present Pulsed High Energy Radiation Machine Emitting X-Rays capability
with the new technology developed for DARHT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE does not intend, in this EIS, to analyze alternatives or issues beyond the construction and operation of DARHT
that relate to the nation's nuclear weapons policies, the DOE mission of stockpile stewardship and management, the
need for hydrodynamic testing or dynamic testing that are part of the stockpile stewardship and management program,
the mission of LANL, or continued operation of other facilities at LANL. To the extent that these matters are under
the purview of DOE, they will be considered in the Programmatic EIS on Stockpile Stewardship and Management or the
LANL Sitewide EIS, as discussed below in the section on related NEPA reviews. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS will identify and analyze the direct, indirect and cumulative effects resulting from the completion and operation
of DARHT. DOE has tentatively identified the following environmental and socioeconomic issues for consideration
in the EIS and seeks public comment on the adequacy and inclusiveness of these issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Natural ecosystems, including air quality, surface and groundwater quality, and plants and animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Cultural resources, including archeological sites, historic resources, other facilities and infrastructure
at LANL, and actual and potential uses of the site including Native American cultural, traditional and religious
uses; DOE has previously identified Native American archeological sites in the vicinity of DARHT and has conducted
mitigating activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Economic impacts, including those from constructing, equipping and operating DARHT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Socioeconomic impacts, including any disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and low income
populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health and safety impacts to on-site workers, other LANL personnel, local communities and tribes, and the
general population of northern New Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other construction and operational impacts, such as transportation of people and materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Waste management considerations, including the eventual decontamination and decommissioning of the facility
after the end of its useful life (approximately 30 years). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Health and safety, environmental, and other impacts related to the transport, storage and use of hazardous
and radioactive materials and generation of X-ray radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other relevant issues identified by DOE or the State, tribes, other agencies, or the public through this scoping
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Related NEPA Reviews
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is currently preparing to undertake two related NEPA reviews. The planned LANL Sitewide EIS (59 FR
40889, August 10, 1994) will consider the cumulative impacts of operations and planned activities foreseen within
the next 5 to 10 years. The planned Stockpile Stewardship and Management Programmatic EIS (59 FR 54175, October 28,
1994) will evaluate activities required to maintain a high level of confidence in the safety, reliability, and performance
of nuclear weapons in the absence of nuclear testing, and to be prepared to test weapons if so directed by the President.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Classified Material
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will review classified material while preparing this EIS. Within the limits of classification, DOE
will provide to the public as much information as possible. If DOE needs to generate classified material to explain
the purpose and need, use, materials, or impacts from this project, that material will be segregated into a classified
appendix.

Public Involvement Opportunities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE will develop a stakeholder involvement plan to guide the public review aspects of this EIS. To assist with developing
the stakeholder involvement plan, DOE requests suggestions by the public on how this EIS process should be conducted,
including suggestions regarding the type, format and conduct of public involvement opportunities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through this Notice, DOE formally invites the State, tribes, other government agencies and the public to comment
on the scope of the EIS. DOE will offer informational briefings to tribal governments, local (county and municipal)
governments, and the State of New Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second formal opportunity for comment will be provided after DOE issues the draft EIS, expected in mid-1995. Public
hearings will be held in conjunction with that comment period. DOE will inform the State, tribes, local governments,
other agencies and the general public of its final decisions at the time the Record of Decision is issued, expected
in October 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to formal opportunities for comment, any person may submit comments at any time during the NEPA review
process; however, to ensure that comments are considered at specific points in the NEPA review, and to best assist
DOE, the public is encouraged to comment during the formally established comment periods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of DARHT design and other background documents, written comments, records of public meetings, and other materials
related to the development and analyses of the EIS have been and are being placed in the Los Alamos National Laboratory

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on November 4, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed an abbreviated application
in Docket No. CP95&hyph;61&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's regulations for permission and approval for a flexible, blanket type authorization for
temporary deactivation of storage facilities and operations as well as minor construction at its storage fields
in the Majorsville-Heard Storage Complex. Columbia requests that any authorization granted be ongoing, and notes
that the coal mining activities affecting its storage operations and necessitating this application will continue
for at least the next 13 years. Columbia's proposal is more fully described in its application which is on file with
the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia states that authorization is necessary in order for it to have the flexibility to respond appropriately
to active long wall coal mining in the Majorsville-Heard Storage Complex by Consol Pennsylvania Coal Company and/or
its affiliates (Coal Companies). Columbia says it must fulfill the requirements of the Agreements negotiated between
itself and the Coal Companies which state their respective rights, duties, and obligations and liabilities relating
to the temporary deactivation of the Storage Complex to accommodate mining operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia is filing an application for expansion of its Crawford Storage Field, contemporaneously with the instant
application, to offset lost capabilities at the Storage Complex.

Take notice that on November 9, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243,
filed an amendment pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to its July 19, 1993 application, as amended February
18, 1994, for authorization to construct and operate pipeline and related facilities at the United States-Canada
International Boundary proximate to St. Clair, Michigan, all as more fully set forth in the amendment which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANR states that its project has been restructured. First, ANR states that two shippers, Michigan Consolidated Gas
Company (MichCon) and The Consumers' Gas Company Limited (Consumers Gas), will now transport up to 75,000 Mcf per
day. (Consumers Gas was the only shipper in the original application with a maximum transportation volume of 66,000
Mcf per day.) Second, Consumers Gas now intends to construct and operate the facilities in Canada necessary to transport
gas delivered by ANR. Third, ANR has eliminated the ANR/Great Lakes Gas Transmission custody transfer measurement
facilities proposed in the original application, included the cost of the ANR/MichCon Columbus Meter Station, and
has reflected new pipe material specifications and 1995 cost adjustments in its cost of facilities. This results
in an estimated cost of facilities of $15,298,000.

Natural seeks authorization to abandon various delivery point connections located in Clarion, Forest and Jefferson
Counties, Pennsylvania. These delivery points currently serve 26 residential gas customers of National Fuel Gas
Distribution Corporation (Distribution). Natural states that these delivery points are located along non-jurisdictional
production pipelines that will be conveyed to G &amp; G Gas, Incorporated, a local production company in Pennsylvania.
Natural states that Clarion River Gas Company (CRG), a Pennsylvania public utility will assume service obligations
to these 26 customers following the conveyance. Natural also states that Distribution and all 26 affected customers
have consented to the abandonment. Natural states that the facilities were authorized in Docket Nos. CP73&hyph;294&hyph;000
and CP90&hyph;1399&hyph;000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;157.216(b), National confirms that it has provided notice of the proposed abandonments to the
Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PaPUC), which is the state commission having jurisdiction over Distribution
in this proceeding. In addition, the transfer of customers from Distribution to CRG will require approval of the PaPUC.
Natural states that an application for such approval has been filed by Distribution.

Take notice that on November 4, 1994, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) filed an abbreviated application
in Docket No. CP95&hyph;62&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and Part 157 of the Commission's
regulations, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation
of certain natural gas storage facilities at its existing Crawford Storage Field. Columbia seeks authorization
to increase annual turnover by approximately 8.2 Bcf with an associated increase in design day deliverability of
approximately 67 MMcfd. Columbia proposes to increase storage capacity of its Crawford Storage Field to offset the
temporary deactivation of storage operations at Columbia's Majorsville Storage Complex located on the West Virginia
and Pennsylvania border. Columbia's proposal is more fully described in its application which is on file with the
Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Columbia seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing: (a) Increased operations
at the Crawford Storage Field located in Hocking and Fairfield Counties, Ohio with a maximum storage capacity of 52
Bcf excluding 9 Bcf of native gas with 17.65 Bcf of annual turnover and 232.2 MMcfd of design day deliverability; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the construction and operation of four additional storage wells; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the construction and operation of 5.01 miles of replacement and new pipelines and appurtenances if the Crawford
Storage Field and at the Crawford Compressor Station in Hocking and Fairfield Counties, Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia states that the increase in Crawford's storage capabilities is necessary due to the allocation of all Columbia's
storage capacity to its customers as part of the implementation of Order No. 636. If Columbia does not replace the lost
storage capability at Majorsville Storage Complex with an equivalent capability at Crawford, then it will have less
storage to meet its long-term Firm Storage Service (FSS) commitments than was approved by the Commission in Columbia's
Order No. 636 proceeding.

Take notice that on November 10, 1994, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf) tendered a filing requesting
to withdraw certain tariff sheets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 31, 1994, Columbia Gulf tendered a revised filing in RP94&hyph;219&hyph;003, et al. which, among other
things, motioned certain tariff sheets into effect that were originally filed on April 29, 1994 (motion rate filing).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has come to Columbia Gulf's attention that the motion rate filing moved into effect tariff sheets in certain X-Rate
Schedules, contained in Volume No. 2 of Columbia Gulf's tariff, that it has filed to cancel due to abandonment authorized
in other dockets. Some of the tariff sheets cancelling the relevant X-Rate Schedules have been accepted by the Commission
and others are pending before the commission. In addition, the tariff sheet for Rate Schedule X&hyph;35 should not
have been part of the April 29th filing since its cancellation was approved March 21, 1991, to be effective November
28, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, Columbia Gulf requests to withdraw the Volume No. 2 tariff sheets listed below, which were motioned into
effect in the October 31, 1994 filing:

Take notice that on November 14, 1994, Florida Gas Transmission Company (FGT) tendered for filing to become part of

FGT states that on May 2, 1994, FGT filed in Docket No. TM94&hyph;4&hyph;34&hyph;000 (May 2 Filing) to suspend its
Annual Unit Take-or-Pay Surcharge (TOP Surcharge) effective June 1, 1994. This filing was subject to a supplemental
filing to be made by FGT to reflect actual balances pertaining to its collection of the take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down
costs (Southern Fixed Charges) billed by Southern Natural Gas Company (``Southern'') and to make any related tariff
changes required. On May 18, 1994, the Commission issued an order (May 18 Order) accepting FGT's May 2 filing subject
to the supplemental filing by FGT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 12, 1994, FGT made the supplemental filing (September 12 Filing) in compliance with the Commission's
May 18 Order which detailed the Southern Fixed Charge account balances by customer, proposed certain changes to Section
25 of FGT's General Terms and Conditions (GTC), and reinstated the TOP Surcharge to recover the outstanding Southern
Fixed Charge account balances owed FGT by certain customers. Several parties protested FGT's September 12 filing
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (protesting parties). On October 3, 1994, FGT filed an answer (October 3 Answer) to the protests in order to clarify
certain misunderstandings and misrepresentations contained in the protests.

On October 28, 1994, the Commission issued its Order Accepting and Suspending Tariff Sheets Subject to Refund and
Conditions, and Granting Waiver (October 28 Order). The October 28 Order accepted the tariff sheets submitted wit
FGT's September 12 Filing, subject to refund, and directed FGT to provide additional information and documentation
regarding the determination of the remaining charges in response to the protesting parties' concerns. FGT is filing
concurrently herewith the information in compliance with the October 28 Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FGT states that in compiling the detailed information provided in the compliance filing FGT discovered certain minor
errors which affected the recoveries from two customers, Consolidated Minerals (Consolidated) and Orlando Utilities
Commission (OUC). Because recoveries affect the memorandum account balances and carrying charge calculations
which affect the flowthrough cap calculations, FGT has recalculated all of the schedules submitted with the September
12 Filing. Because of the impact of the adjustments to the recoveries from Consolidated and OUC, the unit surcharge
rate proposed to become effective December 1, 1994 changed from 12.73

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with &sect;385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before November 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate actions to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

states that it is (1) clarifying tariff language addressing refunds, (2) proposing additional tariff language to
clarify Additional Adjustments made under Section 20.2(f) of the General Terms and Conditions (GT&amp;C) of its
tariff, and (3) proposing GT&amp;C subsection 20.2(g) to provide for a true up filing to be made subsequent to the final
billing in each upstream pipeline's TOP proceeding. National proposes an effective date of July 29, 1994, to coincide
with the effective date of its other tariff sheets addressing the flowthrough of TOP charges.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy today solicits financial contributions from non-Federal sources to at least match $8,000,000
in Federal funding, in support of the national, comprehensive Electric and Magnetic Fields (EMF) Research and Public
Information Dissemination Program, described in the Notice of Intent to Solicit Non-Federal Contributions, published
November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59461). Section 2118 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13475) requires the Department
of Energy to solicit funds from non-Federal sources to offset at least 50 percent of the total funding for all activities
under this program. Section 2118 also precludes the Department of Energy from obligating funds for program activities
in any fiscal year unless funds received from non-Federal sources are available in an amount at least equal to 50 percent
of the amount appropriated by Congress. Appropriations for expenditure under section 2118 have been enacted under
the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1995 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;316) in the amount of $8,000,000 for
fiscal year 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The settling parties are Donivan and Ora Lee Ratliff (the Ratliffs) and Don and Connie Fultz (the Fultzs), former operators
of the Renner Road Shooting Range, also known as Schroeder's Gun Club, which is the subject Superfund Site (the Site).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Renner Road Shooting Range is located in Shawnee, Kansas in the north-central portion of Johnson County, approximately
12 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri. This Site is located in an area experiencing dramatic growth and development
and the tract is expected to be developed for residential use. The 58 acre parcel was used as a gun club from the mid 1950's
to 1976.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firing of shot guns resulted in lead contamination at the Site. EPA Region VII issued an Action Memorandum on March
18, 1993 for conduct of a time-critical removal action. EPA Region VII began on-site removal activities in the Spring
of 1994. The removal is complete. We excavated approximately 3,600 cubic yards of contaminated soil, solidified
it and transported it off-site to an approved disposal facility. Clean up costs are approximately $1 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Region VII issued administrative orders on consent to the Fultzs and the Ratliffs for settlement of their responsibility
through a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 waste contributor settlement. These settlements have been approved by the Department of Justice as required under
section 122(g) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g) because the response costs in this matter exceed $500,000. The terms of
these settlements require the Fultzs to pay $11,250 and the Ratliffs to pay $30,000. EPA determined these amounts
to be fair shares of liability based on the amount of hazardous substances contributed by each of the settling parties.
These settlements include contribution protection from lawsuits by other potentially responsible parties as provided
for under section 122(g)(5) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9622(g)(5).

relief pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of CERCLA and section 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of
1980, as amended (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6973. The settlements contain a reopener clause which nullifies the covenant not
to sue if the parties fail to make the required payments or if any information becomes known to EPA that indicates that
the parties: (1) Conducted or permitted the generation, transportation, storage, treatment or disposal of any hazardous
substance at the Site after the effective date of the order; or (2) that the parties no longer meet the criteria for a

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The union filed clarification of unit (CU) petitions requesting that certain recognized bargaining units be clarified
to include employees who it claimed has accreted to the units as a result of a reorganization which (1) disestablished
the employing entity in which the units were originally recognized (the previous entity) and (2) created a new entity
(the current employing activity) encompassing the previous one as well as others in which no labor organizations
held exclusive recognition. The union claimed that the new entity was the successor employer to the one in which recognition
previously was granted. The current employing activity filed representative status (RA) petitions challenging
the continued appropriateness of the units for which clarification was sought.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Acting Regional Director (ARD) dismissed the CU petitions and directed that representation elections be conducted.
These factors are: (1) The existing unit must be transferred substantially intact to the gaining employer; (2) the
appropriateness of the unit must remain unimpaired in the gaining employer; and (3) a question concerning representation
(QCR) may not be timely raised as to the representative status of the incumbent union. In the ARD's view, the second

 factors. With regard to the second factor, the Authority found it unclear from precedent whether and/or how accretion
principles are or should be applied to determine whether the appropriateness of bargaining units remains unimpaired
as a result of a reorganization. The Authority questioned whether the continued appropriateness of a unit must be
established before a finding is made as to whether other employees have accreted into it, or whether these determinations
should be made in another way or sequence. With regard to the third 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;503), amended the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.
552a) by adding certain protections for individuals applying for and receiving Federal benefits. Section 7201 of
the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), further amended the Privacy Act regarding
protections for such individuals. The Privacy Act, as amended, regulates the use of computer matching by Federal
agencies when records in a system of records are matched with other Federal, State, or local government records. It
requires Federal agencies involved in computer matching programs to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Negotiate written agreements with the other agency or agencies participating in the matching programs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obtain the Data Integrity Boards' approval of the match agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Furnish detailed reports about matching programs to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Notify applicants and beneficiaries that their records are subject to matching; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Verify match findings before reducing, suspending, terminating, or denying an individual's benefits or payments.

The Kerr Hydroelectric Project (``Project'') is located on the Flathead Indian Reservation, and in Flathead and
Lake Counties, in northwestern Montana. The Kerr Dam and portions of the project works, including approximately
one half of the Project's reservoir, are located within the exterior boundary of the Flathead Indian Reservation.
The north half of the Project's reservoir is located in Flathead and Lake Counties. At the north shore of Flathead Lake,
a portion of the Project is located within the Flathead Waterfowl Production Area, which is owned and administered
by the Fish and Wildlife Service as part of the National Wildlife Refuge System.

On July 17, 1985, as the result of a negotiated settlement, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``Commission'')
issued a new 50-year operating license for the Kerr Project, jointly to the Montana Power Company and the Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Tribes as co-licensees.

Consistent with the terms of the Kerr Project license, the Secretary is providing interested parties with notice
and an opportunity to comment on the proposed Section 4(e) conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed conditions for the Flathead Indian Reservation provide for the imposition of a base load operational
scenario at the Kerr Project. This operational scenario precludes the use of Kerr Dam as a load regulating or peak power
generation facility, and requires minimum flows, certain restrictions on flow fluctuations (ramping rates), and
a two year ramping rate study. In addition, the proposed conditions provide for non-operational measures designed
to protect and provide for adequate utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation in conjunction with operational
measures. The non-operational measures include the development of a Fish and Wildlife Implementation Strategy,
development of an operational rule curve, habitat acquisition, habitat development, fishery supplementation
and reintroduction, development of recreational resources, and the identification and protection of cultural
resources on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The proposed conditions for the Flathead WPA provide for the imposition
of erosion control on the north shore of Flathead Lake and the upper Flathead River, island restoration, and habitat
acquisition and development. The costs of all measures will be borne by the project licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed conditions are available for review at the Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington,
DC in room 6443. Copies of the proposed Section 4(e) conditions are being sent to all individuals, agencies and organizations
on the Commission's service list for the Kerr Project, and to those who have otherwise requested to be included on the
Secretary's Kerr Project Section 4(e) mailing list. The document will be mailed to all interested parties requesting
copies. The Secretary's final conditions will be informed by evidence and comments submitted within 30 days of the
date of publication of this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, section 202(f) of the Federal
Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, and 43 CFR part 1610, a Proposed Resource Management Plan/Final Environmental
Impact Statement (PRMP/FEIS) has been prepared for the Coos Bay District, Oregon. The PRMP/FEIS describes and analyzes
future options for managing approximately 329,700 acres of mostly forested public land and 12,150 acres of non-federal
surface ownership with federal mineral estate administered by the Bureau of Land Management in Coos, Curry, Douglas,
and Lane counties in southwestern Oregon.

DATES:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 There will be a 30-day comment/protest period beginning when the Environmental Protection Agency publishes its
Notice of Availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, anticipated to be November 18, 1994. Anyone can comment on the PRMP/FEIS but only those persons or organizations
who participated in the planning process leading to this PRMP/FEIS may protest. Protests must be postmarked within
the 30-day comment/protest period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A protesting party may raise only those issues which were submitted for the record during the planing process. Protests
of proposed plan elements that merely adopt decisions made in the Record of Decision for Amendments to Forest Service
and Bureau of Land Management Planning documents Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (SEIS ROD) will be dismissed
as the Director has no authority to overrule those decisions. Details of the protest process can be found in the PRMP/FEIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public participation has occurred throughout the RMP process. A Notice of Intent was filed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 28,1986 (Volume 51, number 167, page 30718). Since that time, numerous public meetings, mailings, and briefings
were conducted to solicit comments and ideas. The Draft RMP/EIS was available for public review and comment from August
21, 1992 to December 21, 1992. Written comments were received from agencies, organizations, and individuals. Oral
comments were also received at public meetings held in North Bend, Reedsport, and Gold Beach Oregon. All comments
presented throughout the process have been considered in preparation of the PRMP/FEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PRMP/FEIS describes and analyzes seven alternatives to resolve the following issues: (1) Timber production
practices; (2) Old-growth forests and habitat diversity; (3) Threatened and Endangered and other special status
species habitat (including habitat for the northern spotted owl); (4) Special areas; (5) Visual resources; (6) Stream/riparian/water
quality; (7) Recreation resources; (8) Wild and scenic rivers; (9) Land tenure; and (10) Rural interface areas. The
issues are analyzed in seven distinct alternatives, with each alternative representing a complete management plan
for the district.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Resource Management Plan responds to the need for a healthy forest ecosystem with habitat that will support
populations of native species (particularly those associated with late-successional and old-growth forests).
It also responds to the need for a sustainable supply of timber and other forest products that will help maintain the
stability of local and regional economies, and contribute valuable resources to the national economy, on a predictable
and long-term basis. BLM-administered lands are primarily allocated to Riparian Reserves, Late-Successional
Reserves, General Forest Management Areas, and Connectivity/Diversity Blocks. An Aquatic Conservation Strategy
would be applied to all lands and waters under BLM jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 61,900 acres would be managed for timber production. The annual probable sale quantity would be 5.3
million cubic feet (32.1 million board feet). To contribute to biological diversity, standing trees, snags, and
down, dead woody material would be retained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management would provide for a wide variety of recreation opportunities, with particular emphasis on enhancement
of opportunities for dispersed recreational use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 184 miles of river found eligible for designation and studied by BLM would be found not suitable for
designation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most BLM-administered lands would remain available for mineral leasing and location of mining claims, but 1,600
acres would be closed to leasing for oil and gas and geothermal resources, and 12,500 acres would be closed to location
of claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRMP/FEIS proposes continuation of designation of one Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), one Research
Natural Area (RNA), and designation of nine new ACECs. The Proposed RMP would designate or redesignate the following
ACECs and RNA with the noted restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (as amended) and the California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA), the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Cachuma Project Authority (Authority) and the Santa Barbara
County Water Agency (Agency) as lead agencies have prepared a joint DEIS/DEIR for the Cachuma Project contract renewal.
The proposed action of the lead agencies is the continuation of the member units' entitlement to water from the Cachuma
Project by means of a renewed water service or repayment contract. The proposed action exercises the provisions of
several federal laws as applicable to Reclamation. Public hearings will be held in three sessions to receive written
or verbal comments on the DEIS/DEIR from interested organizations and individuals on the environmental impacts
of the proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DEIS/DEIR considers the effects of renewing the Cachuma Project Contract under which water service has been provided
to the member units. The existing Cachuma Project Contract (No. I75r-1802) was executed on September 12, 1949, for
irrigation, and municipal and industrial purposes under the provisions of section 9(c)(2) and 9(e) of the 1939 Reclamation
Project Act. The authority for contract renewal is pursuant to the Act of July 2, 1956, 70 Stat. 483, and the Act of June
21, 1963, 77 Stat. 68, requiring the Secretary of the Interior, upon request, to renew long-term contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cachuma Project has been the principal water supply for the majority of the member units since initial deliveries
began in 1955. These member units include the City of Santa Barbara, Goleta Water District, Montecito Water District,
Summerland Water District, Carpinteria County Water District, and the Santa Ynez River Water Conservation District,
Improvement District No. 1. The original Cachuma Project Contract has a term of 40 years, and will expire on May 14,
1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A preferred alternative has not yet been identified for the DEIS/DEIR. Several alternatives, including the ``no
action'' alternative, are evaluated in the DEIS/DEIR, and also describe the existing environment and environmental
consequences of contract renewal. They consider the following issues: environmental improvement and restoration
with respect to biological resources, including fisheries, wildlife, and riparian vegetation, surface water hydrology,
ground-water hydrology, flood control, water supply and demand, water pricing and delivery practices, increased
operational efficiency, increased conservation, conjunctive use, water exchanges and transfers, recreational
enhancement and land use policies, agriculture, socioeconomic conditions, cultural resources, and Indian Trust
Assets. Mitigation of impacts, where necessary, is also identified in the document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Santa Ynez Indian Reservation (Reservation), the Southern California Area Office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA), and the Sacramento Area Office of the BIA have been contacted by Reclamation regarding Indian Trust Assets
(ITAs) that may be affected by the proposed action. No potentially affected ITAs have been identified by the BIA. Under
certain alternatives, reduced ground-water levels in the Santa Ynez River Riparian Basin could affect streamflow
in the Zanja de Cota Creek, to which the Reservation Indians have certain water diversion rights.

20 million U.S. dollars (US$20,000,000). The name and address of the Borrower's representatives to be contacted

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H&hyph;1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR parts 655, subpart D, and 29 CFR part 504, (January
6, 1994). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing and those which have been
rejected.

byproduct material who are applying for registration of the source or device.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. An estimate of the number of responses annually: 134.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. An estimate of the total number of hours needed annually to complete the requirement or request: The suggested recordkeeping
provisions in the draft regulatory guide will require up to 160 hours per recordkeeper, for an industry burden of 21,440

Commonwealth Edison Company (ComEd, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;19,
which authorizes operation of the Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit 2 (the facility), at a steady-state power level
not in excess of 2527 megawatts thermal. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in Grundy
County, Illinois. This license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations,
and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated October 28, 1994, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), ComEd requested a schedular exemption for Dresden,
Unit 2, from the 18-month test interval for a Type A Integrated Leak Rate Test (ILRT) as required by 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J, Section III.A.6.(b). The exemption is requested to avoid a potential reactor shut down to perform the Type A test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to two forced outages, ComEd has had to reschedule the Dresden, Unit 2, refueling outage from September 1994 to
July 1995. Subsequently, ComEd requested a maximum extension of up to an additional 242 days for the 18-month Appendix
J test interval for a Type A test. The Type A test can not be performed during power operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its letter dated October 28, 1994, ComEd requested a one-time exemption from the 18-month Type A test interval requirement
of Appendix J. ComEd has provided leakage test results and maintenance information for the past two outage testing
programs. The two consecutive Type A ILRT failures that placed Dresden, Unit 2, on the accelerated test schedule were
because of the addition of the Type B and C test leakage results to the Type A leakage rate_not problems with the Type
A boundaries. The minimum pathway data from the last two Unit 2 refueling outages (D2R12 and D2R13) indicate that,
on a minimum pathway basis, the quality of primary containment does not degrade excessively through the course of
the fuel cycle. The total containment leakage rate minus the Type B and C leakages for the last two Type A test failures
during D2R12 and D2R13 are 285.5 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) and 302.62 scfh, respectively. These values are
47 percent and 50 percent of the Type A ILRT acceptance criteria of 610.56 scfh (0.75L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The acceptance criteria are from the Dresden, Unit 2, Technical Specification (TS) Section 3.7.A.2.b.(1). During
the D2R13 refueling outage, the Type A ILRT failed due to a leak of the inboard flange of the reactor building to suppression
chamber vacuum breaker valve (2&hyph;1601&hyph;20A). This leakage was quantified to be 12720.05 scfh. If this did
not occur, the Type A ILRT results would have been 543.40 scfh, which is less than the TS limit of 610.56 scfh (0.75L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). During the D2R13 refueling outage, the Type A test failed due to the as-found minimum pathway leakage of primary
containment isolation valves found during Type B and C testing. The volumes that were the major contributors to this
failure are as follows: The ``B'' feedwater line isolation check valves (2&hyph;220&hyph;58B and 2&hyph;220&hyph;62B),
shutdown cooling isolation valves (2&hyph;1001&hyph;1A, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;1B, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2A, 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2B
and 2&hyph;1001&hyph;2C), reactor water clean-up isolation valves (2&hyph;1201, 2&hyph;1201&hyph;1A, 2&hyph;1201&hyph;3,
2&hyph;1299&hyph;004 and 2&hyph;1299&hyph;005), low pressure coolant injection containment spray isolation
valves (2&hyph;1501&hyph;27B and 2&hyph;1501&hyph;28B), high pressure coolant injection drain pot to suppression
chamber valves (2&hyph;2301&hyph;34 and 2&hyph;2301&hyph;71), traversing incore probe purge check valve (2&hyph;4799&hyph;514),
electrical penetration X&hyph;202W, and drywell bellow X&hyph;113. The total minimum pathway leakage for these
volumes was 685.75 scfh. Each of the above valves and volumes were repaired during the refueling outage and subsequently
passed post-maintenance Type B and C tests prior to restart of Unit 2 for the current operating cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time the pertinent requirements of Appendix J were established (1973), the typical nuclear power plant fuel
cycle lasted 12 months. Section III.A.6.(b) may have been written to require a Type A test at every refueling outage_specifying
a numerical cap on the interval to prevent extreme cases of very long intervals (caused by extended shutdowns or operations
at reduced power) between tests. An 18-month cap was reasonable for 12-month fuel cycles, but with the current 18-
and 24-month fuel cycles, it clearly is not sufficient. The intent of Section III.A.6.(b) is to increase the testing
frequency for a containment that exhibits leakage problems, but not to increase it so much that special shutdowns
are required. Refueling outages are the only reasonable time to perform Type A test, since most plants do not have extended
shutdowns at any other time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to add an additional margin of safety and to account for the possible increase in the leakage of a containment
penetration, the licensee has imposed an administrative limit for Dresden, Unit 2, on the total maximum allowable
containment leakage rate until the completion of the current operating cycle. This limit will be 519.0 scfh, which
is 85 percent of the TS limit of 610.56 scfh (0.75L
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
a
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). All additional minimum pathway leakage will be added to the current total as operational Type B and C leak rate tests
are performed during the current operating cycle. These corrective measures taken should reduce the chances of D2R14
failing the ``As Found'' Type A ILRT test.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has reviewed ComEd's submittal regarding the Appendix J test interval exemption request. Based on the above,
the staff concludes that the licensee's corrective action and administrative leakage limit have reduced the likelihood
of excessive leakage during the proposed extension of the Type A test interval. Further, considering the intent of
the 18-month interval cap and its relation to longer fuel cycles, the staff finds that the safety benefit to be derived
from performing a Type A test at 18 months rather than 26 months does not justify the hardship of a forced plant shutdown.
Therefore, the staff finds that the requested Type A interval extension should be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a one-time exemption from the 18-month Type A test interval requirements as prescribed in 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix
J, and is intended to be in effect until July 14, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its October 28, 1994, letter, ComEd also identified special circumstances. As discussed above, the exemption
request is for a short duration relative to the 18-month requirement. This meets a criterion for a special circumstance
per 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), i.e., ``The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation
and the licensee or applicant has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation.''

V
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), that (1) this exemption is authorized
by law and will not endanger life or property or the common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest,
and (2) the Exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made
good faith efforts to comply with the regulation. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants an exemption as described
in Section III above from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Section III.A.6.(b), to the extent that the 18-month interval
for performing the Type A test may be extended for 242 days until July 14, 1995, on a one-time only basis, for Dresden,
Unit 2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32 the Commission has determined that the granting of this Exemption will have no significant
impact on the environment (59 FR 56095).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government of Japan currently is in the process of preparing a five-year plan for deregulation measures in Japan,
which it expects to finalize by the end of March, 1995. The United States Government has provided the Government of
Japan with an initial list of comments and specific suggestions regarding the deregulation plan, and the United States

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of the past year, the United States has held three rounds of consultations with Japan addressing deregulation
and competition policy issues in a working group established under the Joint Statement on the United States-Japan
Framework for a New Economic Partnership (the ``Framework''). In these consultations, the United States has proposed
specific regulatory changes by the Government of Japan as well as more general changes in regulatory practices, administrative
procedures, and competition policy enforcement. In addition, in other contexts the United States has held other
consultations with Japan addressing deregulation issues in particular sectors or with respect to particular structural
issues.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In March and June, 1994, Japan announced specific, initial deregulatory measures that it would take in the areas of
housing construction; information and telecommunications; import promotion, market access, and distribution;
and finance, securities, and insurance. The Government of Japan currently is in the process of preparing a five-year
plan to follow up on these initial measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Government of Japan invited interested foreign governments to submit specific deregulation requests and comments
to be taken into consideration in preparing its five-year plan. On October 27, the European Union submitted a list
of deregulation requests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the Government of Japan's invitation, the United States Government, under the coordination of the
Office of the United States Trade Representative, prepared and presented to the Government of Japan, on November
15, 1994, an initial list of deregulation requests and comments for consideration in connection with Japan's five-year
deregulation plan. The list was based on information gathered in the preparation of the annual National Trade Estimates
Report (required by section 181(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2241)), information brought to the
attention of various agencies of the United States Government by U.S. industry, and information gathered by the United
States Government. The list is available for public inspection and copying in the USTR Reading Room: Room 101, Office
of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20506. An appointment to review the
list may be made by calling Brenda Webb (202) 395&hyph;6186. The USTR Reading Room is open to the public from 10 a.m.
to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States Government intends to consult with the Government of Japan in various fora regarding the issues
in the list and regarding the preparation and implementation of the five-year plan. The United States Government
intends to submit to Japan, as appropriate, additional requests or comments regarding the action plan and other deregulation
issues.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on October 11, 1994, the International Securities Clearing Corporation (``ISCC'') filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II,
and III below, which items have been prepared primarily by ISCC. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change consists of the elimination of ISCC's PORTAL program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, ISCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. ISCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) In 1989, ISCC obtained approval to provide a service which would permit ISCC to accept data from the National Association
of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') in connection with transactions in the National Securities Clearing Corporation's
PORTAL system. ISCC would forward instructions regarding PORTAL transactions to the Centrale de Livraison de Valeurs
Mobiliers (``CEDEL'') and The Depository Trust Company's Institutional Delivery System for settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISCC has not processed any PORTAL transactions for over two and one half years. Because this service has not been used
and because currently the NASD does not and in the future the NASD will not transmit information on PORTAL transactions
directly to ISCC, ISCC has determined to discontinue the service. Broker-dealers will have alternative means of
settling transactions in PORTAL securities, including the ability to send data on these transactions directly to
ISCC for transmission to CEDEL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Since the filing will eliminate a service that has no volume and is therefore not cost effective to maintain, elimination
is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ISCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose a burden on competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants,
or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ISCC has not solicited or received any comments. ISCC will notify the Commission of any written comments received
by ISCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The foregoing rule change has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and Rule 19b&hyph;4(e)(4)
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 thereunder in that it effects a change in an existing service of ISCC that does not adversely effect the safeguarding
of securities of funds in the custody or control of ISCC or for which ISCC is responsible and does not significantly
effect the rights or obligations of ISCC or persons using the service. At any time within sixty days of the filing of
such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission
that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

3. Applicants seek on order, which will supersede the Prior Orders, to allow the Funds to issue and sell up to four classes
of shares pursuant to a multiple distribution system (the ``Multiple Distribution System''). Under the requested
order, applicants may offer (i) ``Class A'' shares sold subject to a conventional front-end sales load and a rule 12b&hyph;1
fee which includes a service fee and, under certain circumstances, a CDSC; (ii) ``Class B'' shares sold subject to
a CDSC (for a period typically within a range of three to six years) and a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee which includes a service
fee; (iii) ``Class C'' shares sold subject to a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee which includes a service fee and a CDSC; and (iv)
a class of shares (the ``Class Y'' shares) to be offered and sold without any front-end sales load, CDSC or rule 12b&hyph;1
fee payable by the Fund. Class Y shares will be sold to certain types of investors, including certain institutional
investors, as described in a Fund's prospectus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each of the four classes of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund. Each of
the four classes of shares will be identical except that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the rule 12b&hyph;1 fees (which include a service fee within the meaning of Article III, Section 26 of the Rules
of Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') (``service fee'')) payable by the
Fund to Distributor will be higher for Class B and Class C shares than they will be for Class A shares; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the transfer agency costs attributable to each class may differ; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) each class may bear different Class Expenses, as defined in condition 1 below;

Class expenses include fees under a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan. None of the Funds currently has
adopted a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan. Any such plan adopted in the future would comply with condition
16 below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) the four classes will have different exchange privileges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) only Class B shares will have a conversion feature; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) each affected class of shares will vote separately as a class with respect to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and
on other matters for which separate class voting is appropriate under applicable law; provided that, if the Fund submits
to a vote of both the Class A shareholders and the Class B shareholders an amendment to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan
that would materially increase the amount to be paid thereunder with respect to the Class A shares, the Class A shareholders
and the Class B shareholders will vote separately by class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The distribution structure for all classes of shares will comply with the applicable NASD Rules of Fair Practice
relating to sales charges, including front-end, deferred and asset-based sales charges. Additionally, any service
fees paid by the Funds will meet NASD requirements for the imposition of a service fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. All Class B shares of the Funds will automatically convert to Class A shares a certain number of years after the end
of the calendar month in which the shareholder's order to purchase was accepted. Such number of years, which will depend
on the conversion schedule that applied at the time the Class B shares were originally purchased, may be up to eight.
Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions in respect of Class B shares will
be treated as Class B shares for purposes of the higher rule 12b&hyph;1 fee. However, for purposes of conversion to
Class A shares, all shares in a shareholder's account which are purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions paid in respect of Class B shares (and which have not converted to Class A shares as provided in the following
sentence) will be considered held in a separate sub-account. Each time any Class B shares in the shareholder's account
(other than those in the sub-account referred to in the preceding sentence) convert to Class A shares, an equal pro
rata portion of the Class B shares in the sub-account will also convert to Class A shares. The conversion of Class B to
Class A shares may be suspended if the opinion of counsel obtained by the Funds that the conversion does not constitute
a taxable event under current federal income tax law is no longer available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Adviser or Distributor may choose to reimburse or waive rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class
Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary, temporary basis. The amount of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency
costs or any Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by Adviser or Distributor may vary from class to class. Rule 12b&hyph;1
fees, transfer agency costs and any Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected
to vary from one class to another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations
to reimburse or waive rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class Expenses at different levels for different
classes of the same Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In addition, Adviser or Distributor may waive or reimburse Fund expenses (with or without a waiver or reimbursement
of rule 12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs or any Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of
Fund expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Fund expenses that are waived or reimbursed would
be in turn credited to each class of shares of the Fund based on the relative net assets of the classes. Fund expenses
apply equally to all classes of a Fund. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund expenses at
different levels for different classes of a Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Adviser's or Distributor's ability to effect any of the waivers or reimbursements described above is subject to
the Funds' receipt of a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service that the effecting of such waivers or reimbursements
does not result in any Fund's dividends or distributions constituting ``preferential dividends'' under the Internal
Revenue Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Under the Multiple Distribution System, each of the four classes may be given exchange privileges. Shares of each
class generally will be permitted to be exchanged only for shares of a class with similar characteristics in another
Fund. Class Y shares of a Fund may be exchangeable for Class Y shares of other Funds and shares of certain money market
funds sponsored by Adviser. If the aggregate net asset value of shares of all Funds held by an investor reaches the minimum
amount at which an investor in a Fund may purchase Class A shares of the Fund at net asset value without a front-end sales
load or more on or before December 15 in any year, all Class B or Class C shares of the Fund held by the investor may be exchanged,
at the investor's request, at net asset value, without any front-end sales load or CDSC, for Class A shares of the Fund.
All exchanges that are made at other than relative net asset values of the respective securities to be exchanged will
be made in accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Applicants seek an order to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on redemptions of Class A shares sold pursuant to a complete
front-end sales load waiver applicable to large purchases in addition to a CDSC on certain redemptions of Class B and
Class C shares and to waive such a CDSC in certain circumstances. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares
that were purchased more than a specified period (the ``CDSC Period'') prior to their redemption or that were derived
from the reinvestment of distributions; or on an amount which represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's
account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the period. Any CDSC
will be imposed only on the lesser of the value of the shares redeemed (exclusive of reinvested distributions) or the
total cost of such shares. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it is assumed, unless the shareholder otherwise
specifically directs, that a redemption is made first of any shares in the shareholder's Fund account that are not
subject to a CDSC, second of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends, third of shares held for a period longer
than the CDSC Period, and fourth of shares held for a period no longer than the CDSC Period. In determining the rate of
any applicable CDSC, it is assumed that shares held by the investor for the longest period of time within the CDSC Period
are redeemed. No CDSC will be imposed on any shares issued by the Funds prior to the date of the order requested by this
application except as allowed by the Prior Orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. If a Fund waives or reduces the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be uniformly applied to all offerees in the class
specified. In waiving or reducing a CDSC, the Funds will comply with the requirements of rule 22d&hyph;1 under the
Act as if such CDSC were a sales load. If the Directors/Trustees of a Fund determine to discontinue a waiver of a CDSC,
the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any Class A, Class B or Class C shares purchased
prior to the termination of such waiver would be able to have the CDSC waived as provided in the Fund's prospectus as
in effect at the time of the purchase of such shares.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent the proposed issuance and sale of any of the classes of shares
might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act and to be prohibited
by section 18(f)(1) of the Act and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. In addition, applicants
request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder
to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to implement the proposed CDSC arrangement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate
against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement will not involve borrowing and will not affect the Funds'
assets or reserves; it also will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a Fund, since all the shares
will participate in all of the Fund's income and all of the Fund's expenses (with the exception of the differing rule
12b&hyph;1 fees, transfer agency costs and Class Expenses, if any) on the basis of the relative net assets of the classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Under the Multiple Distribution System, mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to all classes of shares
in a Fund. Further, since all classes of shares will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference
or priority over any other class in a Fund in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation
preferences with respect to particular assets, no class will have any right to require that lapsed dividends be paid
before dividends are declared on the class and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account).

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following
conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a
Fund, and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the Class A, Class B, Class
C and Class Y shares of a Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of the disproportionate rule 12b&hyph;1 fees allocated
to each of the Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the Fund and the fact that the Class Y shares will not bear any rule 12b&hyph;1
fees; (b) the impact of the disproportionate transfer agency costs attributable to each of the Class A, Class B, Class
C and Class Y shares; (c) the different Class Expenses, if any, which shall be limited to the following expenses determined
by the Directors/Trustees to be attributable to a specific class of shares:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports,
prospectuses and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Commission registration fees incurred with respect to a specific class of shares,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) blue sky registration fees incurred with respect to a specific class of shares,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) the expenses of administrative personnel and services required to support the shareholders of a specific class,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) litigation or other legal expenses relating to a specific class of shares,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Directors/Trustees fees or expenses incurred as a result of issues relating to a specific class of shares,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) accounting expenses relating to a specific class of shares;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) any fees imposed pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that lawfully may be allocated to one class which shall
be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; (d) the fact that the Class A, Class B and Class C shares will
each vote separately as a class with respect to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan and that the Class A, Class B, Class C
and Class Y shares will each vote separately as a class with respect to other matters for which separate class voting
is appropriate under applicable law, provided that, if the Fund submits to a vote of both the Class A shareholders and
Class B shareholders an amendment to the Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plan that would materially increase the amount to
be paid thereunder with respect to the Class A shares, the Class A shareholders and the Class B shareholders will vote
separately by class as provided in condition 2 below; (e) the different exchange privileges of the Class A, Class B,
Class C and Class Y shares; (f) the fact that only Class B shares will have a conversion feature; and (g) the designation
of each class of shares of the Fund.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Class A shares under the plan, existing Class B shares will stop converting into Class A unless the
Class B shareholders, voting separately by a class, approve the proposal. The Directors/Trustees shall take such
action as is necessary to ensure that existing Class B shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New
Class A''), identical in all material respects to Class A as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no
later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Class A. If deemed advisable by the Directors/Trustees
to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Class B shares for a new class (``New
Class B''), identical to existing Class B shares in all material respects except that New Class B will convert into
New Class A. New Class A or New Class B may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described
in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Directors/Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject
to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange,
or conversion of New Class A or New Class B shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Class B shares sold
after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Class A shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided
that the material features of the Class A plan and the relationship of such plan to the Class B shares are disclosed in
an effective registration statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Directors/Trustee of each of the Funds, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall
have approved the Multiple Distribution System prior to the implementation of the Multiple Distribution System
by a particular Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Directors/Trustees of each of the Funds regarding the deliberations
of the Directors/Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Distribution System
will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Multiple Distribution System is in the best interests
of both the Funds and their respective shareholders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the Directors/Trustees of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under
the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the
four classes of shares. The Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent Directors/Trustees, shall
take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Adviser and Distributor
will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the Directors/Trustees. It a conflict arises,
Adviser and Distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing one or more new
registered management investment companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Directors/Trustees of the Funds will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and
shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended
from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular
class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or service fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related
to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the Directors/Trustees to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent Directors/Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to its Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares, to the extent any dividends
are paid, will be calculated in the same manner at the same time on the same day and will be in the same amount, except that
rule 12b&hyph;1 fee payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and
any incremental transfer agency costs or Class Expenses relating to the Class A, Class B, Class C or Class Y shares will
be borne exclusively by that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the Class
A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares, and the proper allocation of income and expenses among the classes, have been
reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to
the staff of the Commission as Exhibit D to this application, stating that such methodology and procedures are adequate
to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert,
or an appropriate Substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being
made under the Multiple Distribution System and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to
the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as
part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to Sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work
papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide),
will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request to the Funds for such work papers
by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief
Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director and any Regional Administrators or Associate and
Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and
the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,''
as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards
as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The initial determination of Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a class and any subsequent changes
thereto has been or will be reviewed and approved by the Directors/Trustees, including a majority of the independent
Directors/Trustees. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by
a Fund to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the Directors/Trustees, and the Directors/Trustees shall review at
least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating
the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the four classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses
among the four classes of shares. This representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred
to in condition 7 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing
basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective
measures if the Expert or appropriate Substitute Expert does not so concur in the ongoing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The prospectuses of the Funds relating to the Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares will contain a statement
to the effect that a salesperson and any other person may receive different levels of compensation for selling or servicing
one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares may appropriately
be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform
to such standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees
of the Funds with respect to the Multiple Distribution System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished
to the Directors/Trustees as part of the materials setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the Directors/Trustees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The shareholder reports of each
Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder
reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related
to the Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on
a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature
describes the expenses or performance data applicable to Class A, Class B, Class C or Class Y shares, it will disclose
the expenses and/or performance data applicable to the four classes. The information provided by applicants for
publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will present
separately Class A, Class B, Class C and Class Y shares.

14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their
rule 12b&hyph;1 or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plans in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Class B shares will convert into Class A shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without
the imposition of any sales load, fee or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an
asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules
of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which
they were subject prior to the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Any non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan adopted by a Fund will be adopted and operated in accordance
with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject
to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed Rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16169 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.

Applicants' Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is a Massachusetts business trust registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.
Currently, the Trust is authorized to offer three separate investment portfolios (the ``Portfolios''): Pacific
Capital Cash Assets Trust, Pacific Capital Tax-Free Cash Assets Trust, and Pacific Capital U.S. Treasuries Cash
Assets Trust. Each Portfolio holds itself out as a ``money market fund'' and therefore seeks to maintain a stable net
asset value of $1.00 per share pursuant to rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act. Aquila Distributors, Inc., a registered broker-dealer,
serves as the distributor of the Trust's shares. Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited serves as investment adviser to
the Trust. Applicants request that relief extend to any future trust, series or portfolio of a Trust that is advised
by the Adviser or whose shares are distributed by the Distributor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trust proposes to offer two classes of shares of each of its Portfolios: Original Shares and Service Shares (the
``Dual Class System''). The currently outstanding shares of each Portfolio will be classified as Original Shares.
If exemptive relief is granted, Original Shares will be sold solely to (1) financial institutions for the investment
of funds for which they act in a fiduciary, agency, investment advisory or custodial capacity; (2) persons entitled
to exchange into Original Shares under the exchange privileges of the Trust; and (3) shareholders owning shares of
the Trust of record on the date that both classes of shares are first made available. Original Shares will be sold without
the imposition of any sales charges and will not be subject to any asset-based distribution charges permitted by rule
12b&hyph;1 under the Act. However, Original Shares will continue to be subject to the normal and customary expenses
of the Trust such as advisory and administrative fees and other normal operating expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Service Shares will be offered to customers of banks and other financial institutions (``Service Organizations'')
that typically are compensated by service or distribution fees paid by the mutual funds offered to their customers
rather than by transactions or other fees paid directly by such customers. The fees paid by this class could be in the
nature of (1) a distribution fee payable in connection with a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act
(a ``Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan''); (2) an administrative services fee payable pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative
services plan (an ``Administrative Services Plan''); or (3) a distribution fee and an administrative fee as a result
of a combination of the two types of plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each of the Portfolios has adopted a currently effective distribution plan under rule 12b&hyph;1, but neither
the Trust nor the Portfolios make payments under this plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Under amended Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans to be implemented with the Dual Class System, the Trust or each Portfolio, on
behalf of the Services Shares, would typically enter into agreements with and pay the Distributor or the Service Organization
for performing certain services, some of which could be construed as distribution assistance. The expenses of such
payments would be borne entirely by the Service Shares shareholders. Services provided in accordance with the terms
of the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan would not be duplicative of any services to be provided to the Trust or its Portfolios by
the administrator, distributor or transfer agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Under an Administrative Services Plan, the Trust or the Portfolios, on behalf of the Service Shares, would have
the ability to enter into agreements with Service Organizations in which each organization will agree to provide
certain services to its clients, members or customers, who purchase shares. The provision of services under the Administrative
Services Plan would not be duplicative of any services to be provided to the Trust or a Protfolio by its administrator,
distributor, or transfer agent. Each Portfolio would pay a Service Organization for its service in accordance with
the terms of its particular Administrative Services Plan, and the expense of such payment will be borne entirely by
the beneficial owners of the Service Shares.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Under the Dual Class System, each share in a Portfolio, regardless of class, will represent an interest in the Portfolio
and will have identical voting rights, powers, qualifications, terms and conditions, and, in proportion to each
Share's net asset value, liquidation rights and preferences. Each class will differ in that: (a) Each class will have
a different class designation; (b) only the Service Shares will bear the expenses applicable to an Administrative
Services Plan or Rule 12b&hyph;1 plan; (c) each class would bear certain other expenses that are directly attributable
only to that class (``Class Expenses''), as set forth in condition 1; (d) classes will vote separately with respect
to matters relating to the Fund's Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan; and (e) the exchange privileges could vary among the classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The classes of shares of the Portfolios will differ with respect to exchange privileges among the Portfolios and
the portfolios of certain other investment companies advised by the Adviser. All exchanges of shares will be effected
in accordance with the provisions of rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Portfolio expenses (such as advisory fees) will be allocated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to each class on the basis of the relative net asset values of the respective classes. Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan payments,
Administrative Plan payments, and Class Expenses which are attributable to a particular class of shares will be allocated
to that particular class. As a result, the net income and net asset value per share of a class may be different than the
new income and net asset value per share of another class of shares in the same Portfolio.

1. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) exempting them from sections 18(f)(1),
18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of shares representing interests in the
same investment portfolio might be deemed: (1) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning
of section 18(g) of the Act in violation of section 18(f)(1); or (2) to violate the equal voting provisions of section
18(i) of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed arrangement would permit the Trust to facilitate the distribution
of its securities and enhance the scope and depth of its shareholder services without assuming excessive accounting
and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. Applicants also believe that the proposed allocation of
expenses and the voting rights relating to the Administrative Services Plan or Rule 12b-1 Plan in the manner described
above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders.

Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each class of shares of each Portfolio of the Trust will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments
of a Portfolio of the Trust, and will be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between
the classes of shares of the Trust will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the disproportionate Administrative Services
Plan payments, Rule 12b-1 Plan payments, and Class Expenses which will be limited to (i) transfer agent fees as identified
by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing
and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to the current shareholders
of a specific class; (iii) Blue Sky registration fees incurred by a class; (iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a
class; (v) the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific
class; (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class; and (vii) trustees fees incurred as a
result of issues relating to one class; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to the Portfolio's
Rule 12b-1 Plan and Administrative Services Plan; (c) exchange features; and (d) class designation differences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of two classes
of shares (the ``Dual Class System''). The minutes of the respective meetings of the trustees regarding the deliberations
of the trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Dual Class System will reflect in detail the
reasons for the trustees' determination that the Dual Class System is in the best interests of both the Trust and its
shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Trust, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the two classes of shares.
The trustees, including a majority of the non-interested trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Hawaiian Trust Company, Limited as adviser and Aquila Distributors,
Inc. as distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a conflict
arises, the adviser and the distributor, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing
a new registered management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the trustees
who are not interested persons of the Trust. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies
paid or payable by a Portfolio to meet class expenses shall provide to the trustees of the Trust, and the trustees shall
review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Any Administrative Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule
12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders
of Service Shares need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The trustees of the Trust will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder
servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to
time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of
shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to
the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to
that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subjected to the review and
approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Dividends paid by a Portfolio with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will
be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that payments
made by Service Shares under the Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Administrative Services Plan, and any Class Expenses, will
be borne exclusively by that class. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends and distributions of the classes
of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between those classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'')
who has rendered a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Trust that the calculations
are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant
to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request
by the Trust (which the Trust agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written
request to the Trust for such work papers, by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56
FR 2190; January 22, 1991, and 58 FR 9230; February 19, 1993). One issue being addressed by ARAC is aircraft certification
procedures. This issue involves the procedures for aircraft certification found in parts 21, 39, and 183 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR), and Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36 (SFAR 36), which are the responsibility
of the FAA Director, Aircraft Certification Service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 19, 1993, the Production Certification Working Group was established, and notice of establishment was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on March 29, 1993 (58 FR 16574). This Working Group was charged with making recommendations to the ARAC concerning
the modernization of requirements applicable to production approval holders in subparts, F, G, H, J, K, and O of FAR
Part 21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the task was assigned, it became apparent that subpart L of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of FAR Part 45 should
have been included in the review; therefore, the Production Certification Working Group task statement is amended
to include subpart L of FAR Part 21 and subparts A and B of FAR Part 45.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Task: The task statement assigned to the Production Certification Working Group is, therefore, amended to read as
follows: The Production Certification Working Group is charged with making recommendations to the ARAC concerning
the modernization of requirements applicable to production approval holders in subparts F, G, H, J, K, L, and O of FAR
Part 21 and subparts A and B of Part 45. These recommendations involve streamlining the rules to establish a more modern,
standardized set of production approval requirements more responsive to current industry production practices.
The Production Certification Working Group will submit recommendations to the ARAC, which will determine whether
to forward them to the FAA.

 The Department of Transportation solicits public comment on a third draft of a National Program Plan (the Plan) for
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), formerly called Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS). ITS applies
advanced technologies such as information processing, communications, and electronics to surface transportation
needs. The Plan is being developed based on a set of user services, each of which is designed to respond to the needs of
particular users. The draft Plan attempts to integrate Federal, State, local government, and private sector activities
in a single document to present a coherent picture of how the public and private sectors will work together to achieve
ITS program goals. The Plan seeks to reflect the consensus view of all parties interested in the development and deployment
of ITS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The objective of the ITS program is to apply advanced technology in the areas of information processing, communications,
control, and electronics to improve safety, reduce congestion, increase mobility, reduce the energy and environmental
harm caused by transportation, and increase economic productivity. The ITS program also incorporates the use of
strategic planning and innovative management practices at all levels of government to implement those initiatives
which enhance our national surface transportation system, strengthen our economy, and benefit a broad range of users.

that also serves as a utilized Federal Advisory Committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.
2). ITS AMERICA will also be distributing copies of the Plan to its membership and preparing consensus comments on
the Plan; therefore, member comments to ITS AMERICA need not be duplicated in comments to the DOT docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan is intended to clearly present the ITS program to Congress, other government leaders, and private sector
entities. It is intended to guide investment decisions in the development and deployment of ITS products and services
to be made by private entities, the Federal government, and local governments; to facilitate prioritization and
coordination of ITS development activities; to reduce duplication of effort; and to ensure ITS program activities
are directed toward deployment of ITS services in a nationally compatible intermodal system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These services have been grouped into the following categories or ``bundles'': 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Travel and Transportation Management
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would improve the flow of traffic and provide travel-related information to the public; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Travel Demand Management, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which would reduce vehicle demand by encouraging modes other than the single occupancy vehicle; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public Transportation Operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would assist in delivering improved public transportation systems; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commercial Vehicle Operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would improve the efficiency and safety of commercial fleet operations; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Electronic Payment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would allow travelers to pay for transportation services with electronic cards or tags; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Emergency Management
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which can be used by police, fire, and rescue authorities to improve their management of, and response to, emergency
situations; and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advanced Vehicle Control and Safety Systems,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which would provide improved vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The deployment of these user services will depend on a range of issues that will be assessed in formulating and implementing
the Plan, including cost, public acceptance, the maturity or availability of the technologies, and regulatory issues.
The Plan will also serve as the framework for a continuing process that will assess progress and allow government and
private sector investment decisions to be made after the views of all interested parties have been considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Plan is being developed with the user as the focus, the Department is interested in participation from
a broad range of individuals and organizations including, but not limited to, public officials from State and local
governments, consumer groups, vehicle manufacturers and other private sector entities, transit authorities,
toll authorities, small businesses, academic institutions, associations, and individual citizens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is the third notice on the Plan. The first notice, at 58 FR 65814 (December 15, 1993), contained background information
on the national ITS program, including a detailed description of the user services. The second notice, 59 FR 26552
(May 20, 1994), announced a series of five public forums (held around the country in June 1994) to obtain input on the
Plan development. Comments received in response to both notices, and the public forums, have been utilized in preparing
the third draft of the Program Plan that is now available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This draft of the Plan has been substantially revised from the previous draft, and edited to reduce its length and remove
redundancies. A new chapter has been added that discusses the societal, economic, legislative, and other forces
that led to the ITS program. User Service Integration and National Compatibility have been divided into separate
chapters, and the discussion of telecommunications issues has been expanded. The Deployment and Deployment Support
chapters have been substantially revised to reflect 5-, 10-, and 20-year deployment scenarios, provide an analysis
of the potential affects of different levels of public and private sector participation in ITS deployment, and a description
of program initiatives to address deployment barriers. A new Travel Demand Management bundle has been created that
encompasses the Pre-Trip Travel Information, Ride Matching and Reservation, and Demand Management and Operations
user services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a number of comments, a Synopsis of the Plan has been developed and is included with the third draft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This third draft is intended to be the final draft before publication of the first edition the Plan in March, 1995. The
Plan will then be updated periodically to reflect changes in the development and deployment of the ITS program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Information Requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is especially interested in public comment on Chapter 6, Deployment, and Chapter 7, Deployment Support,
the deployment scenarios presented, the analysis of the effects of different levels of public and private sector
participation in ITS deployment, and the discussion of program initiatives to address deployment barriers. Respondents
are also asked to indicate their agreement with the publication of this document, following the comment period and
with comments considered, as the first edition of the National ITS Program Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any additional information, suggestions, opinions or other comments that would assist in further developing the
Plan would be welcome.

<DOCTITLE>American Transportation Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
American Transportation Corporation (AmTran) of Conway, Arkansas, has determined that some of its vehicles fail
to comply with 49 CFR 571.120, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 120, ``Tire Selection and Rims for
Vehicles Other Than Passenger Cars,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and
Noncompliance Reports.'' AmTran has also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of
49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle
safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National
Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise
of judgment concerning the merits of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph S5.3 of FMVSS No. 120 states that each vehicle must have a label affixed which includes the size designation
of the tires and the size designation of the rims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AmTran produced approximately 38,000 buses and school buses from 1987 through 1994 which do not meet the labeling
requirements stated in the standard. The vehicles lack the rim diameter designation on the label. The label does include
the rim width and complete tire size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AmTran supports its application with the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
American Transportation (AmTran) requests that an exemption be granted based on the grounds that the noncompliance
is inconsequential as it related to motor vehicle safety. The rim width is listed on the certification label; however,
the rim diameter is not listed. The complete tire size, including the diameter (which is identical to the rim diameter),
is listed on each label. Therefore, [AmTran] believes that sufficient information is available for the user to match
tire and rim sizes appropriately.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of AmTran, described
above. Comments should refer to the docket number and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that six
copies be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received before the close of business on the closing date indicated below will be considered. The application
and supporting materials, and all comments received after the closing date, will also be filed and will be considered
to the extent possible. When the application is granted or denied, the notice will be published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Congress directed the Secretary of Transportation to study and provide recommendations to address the matter
of public transit buses that exceed Interstate System axle weight limits. The Congress also excluded public transit
buses from Interstate System axle weight limits for 2 years (until October 6, 1994) and provided that the Secretary
could extend the exclusion for an additional year. The study was transmitted to the Congress on September 20, 1994,
but legislation would be required to implement its recommendation to allow higher bus axle weights until lighter
buses can be developed and this will require additional time. Therefore, renewing the exclusion for 1 more year will
allow public transit buses to continue to operate on the Interstate System at axle weights authorized by each state
while a permanent solution is implemented.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 341 of the FY 1993 Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;388,
106 Stat. 1520, at 1552) amended section 1023 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (Pub.
L. 102&hyph;240, 105 Stat. 1914, at 1951) by adding a new paragraph (h). Paragraph (h)(2) required the Secretary to
conduct a study of the maximum axle weight limits of ``public transit vehicles'' on the Interstate System. Paragraph
(h)(1) excluded ``any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger
bus'' from the single- and tandem-axle weight limits imposed on the Interstate System by the second sentence in 23
U.S.C. 127 for 2 years from the effective date of the legislation, October 6, 1992, and authorized the Secretary to
renew the exclusion for an additional year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States that fail to enforce the Interstate System weight limits could be penalized by the loss of their Federal highway
funds under 23 U.S.C. 141(c)(2). Before the exclusion became effective, buses were, on occasion, stopped by State
enforcement personnel and forced to unload passengers until they were no longer overweight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The study required by paragraph (h)(2) was transmitted to the Congress on September 20, 1994. However, action to address
overweight axles of public transit buses on the Interstate System will require additional time. A 1-year extension
will allow public transit buses to continue to operate on the Interstate System without the threat of possible funding
sanctions or the removal of passengers while a permanent solution to the problem is implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any vehicle which is regularly and exclusively used as an intrastate public agency transit passenger
bus is excluded, until October 6, 1995, from the second sentence of section 23 U.S.C. 127 relating to axle weight limitations
for vehicles using the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The public meetings are part of an ongoing dialogue with the Administration to assess the security needs and concerns
of users of the National Information Infrastructure (NII). The NII is a system of high-speed telecommunications
networks, databases, and advanced computer systems that will make electronic information_such as insurance and
financial products, health and educational records, and communication of both a commercial and non-commercial
nature_more widely available and accessible than ever before. This increased availability and accessibility will
dramatically affect the way in which information and information services are created, used, and delivered throughout
the world.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Consequently, broad public and commercial use of the NII hinges upon implementing technologies, policies, and practices
that not only ensure that users of information systems have access to information when and where they need it, but that
subjects of information records are able to protect themselves from unauthorized or inappropriate use of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Americans will not use the NII to its full potential unless they trust that information will go where and when they
want it and nowhere else,'' declared Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information Regulatory Affairs
at OMB and chair of the Forum. ``The Federal government is a primary user of the NII and thus a catalyst for change. Yet
the NII will be designed, built, owned, operated, and used primarily by the private sector, making it essential that
security on the NII be considered in partnership with the public.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address these critical issues, the Vice President formed the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF). The
IITF is chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and is comprised of senior Administration officials having expertise
in technical, legal, and policy areas pertinent to the NII. The mission of the IITF is to articulate and implement the
Administration's vision for the NII.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the IITF to address the cross-cutting issue of security in the
NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the
Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the IITF, the President has established the U.S. Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure.
The Advisory Council represents industry, labor, and public interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce
on issues relating to the NII. Mega-Project III, one of three work groups of the Advisory Council, is responsible for
addressing security, intellectual property, and privacy issues as they relate to the NII.

B. Structure and Content of Public Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Security is linked inextricably to broad public use of the NII. The technologies, policies, and procedures used to
ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally produced and transmitted information, information
products, and services on the NII will determine whether, how, and to what extent digitally linked information services
will be broadly used in such critical sectors as health, education, finance, and insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Development of policies and procedures that will ensure the security of commercial and non-commercial information
and communications on the NII requires study from different perspectives, whether that of the subject of the information,
the user of the information, or the creator of the information. The Forum and Mega-Project III seek input from parties
who represent these views in the areas of health, education, finance, and insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solutions to these concerns will come vita technical solutions, as well as legal and policy mechanisms. The Forum
and Mega-Project III seek input in this area as well. Specifically, what legal measures, policy mechanisms, and technological
solutions, or combinations thereof, can be used to effectively protect the security of health, education, financial,
and insurance information delivered or made accessible on the NII?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will be assembled to discuss the following topics with a panel of senior Administration
officials, members of the Security Issues Forum, and members of the Advisory Council, and to field questions and comments
from other members of the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Position statements for the meeting, ``Security for Financial and Insurance Information in the NII,'' should address
four principal questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. How do you envision the NII being used by the finance and insurance industries to provide enhanced products and services
to customers or to improve operations?

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Specifically, what types of products and services are you contemplating delivering or making available, or would
you like to see delivered or made available on the NII?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What threats do you foresee in making products and services available via the NII? Such threats might include fraud,
unauthorized access, breach of confidentiality or privacy, breach of integrity, and lack of reliability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. What legal, policy, and ethical issues do you foresee affecting usage of the NII? Such issues may include liability,
information/property rights, equal access, document/records management, legal admissibility/evidentiary
requirements, and auditability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What kinds of administrative or technical solutions are you aware of, or would you like to see developed, to address
security, legal, and ethical concerns? Such solutions may include international agreements, criminal laws, public
key encryption, and digital signatures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Position statements for the meeting, ``Security for Health and Education Information in the NII,'' should address
five principal questions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What enhancements in electronic data transmission, storage, and retrieval are needed to protect the confidentiality
of personal health and education information?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What enhancements in electronic data transmission, storage, and retrieval are needed to improve data users' access
to individual health and education information?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How can the NII be constructed to address and satisfy both of these needs simultaneously?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. What safeguards need to be developed to limit children's access to inappropriate material through the NII?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. What technical solutions are available, or can be developed, in order to address these data security concerns?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
