SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations to allow the importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and
the Republic of Korea. As a condition of entry, the Fuji variety apples have to be cold treated and fumigated for certain
injurious insects in Japan or the Republic of Korea under the supervision of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. The Fuji variety apples also have to be inspected by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the
national plant protection agency in Japan or the Republic of Korea prior to export. This action relieves restrictions
on the importation into the United States of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea without presenting
a significant risk of introducing injurious insects into the United States.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 through 319.56&hyph;8 (referred to below as the regulations) prohibit or restrict
the importation into the United States of fruits and vegetables from certain parts of the world to prevent the introduction
and dissemination of injurious insects that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 8, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 29557&hyph;29559, Docket No. 94&hyph;035&hyph;1) a document in which we proposed to amend the regulations
to allow Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea to be imported into the United States under certain
conditions. The importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea has been prohibited because
of the risk that they could introduce injurious insects into the United States. We proposed to allow importation at
the request of those countries' ministries of agriculture and after determining that the apples could be imported
under certain conditions without significant pest risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments on the proposed rule for a 30-day period ending on July 8, 1994. We received two comments by that
date. In one, a foreign ministry of agriculture supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the other, a State department of agriculture expressed concerns regarding the possible spread into the United
States of three fungal diseases (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Diplocarpon mali, Monilinia mali,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternaria mali
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) known to affect apples in Japan and the Pacific rim. Two of the diseases are exotic to the United States and the other
is known to occur only in the Southeastern United States. The commenter recommends that we conduct pest risk assessments
for the three diseases in order to determine if mitigation measures are necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to proposing to allow Fuji variety apples to be imported from Japan and the Republic of Korea, we assessed the
risk of exotic pests being introduced into the United States on the apples. Based on this assessment, we believe that
the risk of the three fungal diseases spreading into the United States will be mitigated by numerous factors. For instance,
these three fungal diseases are primarily leaf pathogens and seldom infect fruit, unless inoculum pressures are
high. Furthermore, the routine cultural practices for Fuji variety apple production in Japan and the Republic of
Korea, such as orchard sanitation and the bagging of fruit, effectively suppress outbreaks of these diseases. Finally,
we believe that the required inspections of the fruit following treatment in Japan or the Republic of Korea will allow
us to easily identify fruit infected with any of the three fungal diseases and prevent its entry into the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Immediate implementation of this rule is necessary to provide relief to those persons who are adversely affected
by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Making this rule effective immediately will allow interested producers
and others in the marketing chain to benefit from this additional source of fruit. Therefore, the Administrator of
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should be effective upon publication
in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are amending the Fruits and Vegetables regulations by allowing the importation of Fuji variety apples from Japan
and the Republic of Korea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to an estimate by the International Apple Institute, U.S. growers produced approximately 160 million
pounds of Fuji apples in 1993, about 1.5 percent of the total U.S. apple production for that year. It is likely that this
estimate understates the amount of Fuji apples produced domestically, as Fuji acreage in California, Washington,
and other States is expanding rapidly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About 75 percent of the Fuji variety apples grown in the United States are grown in California and Washington. In 1993,
growers in California and Washington produced about 60 million pounds per State, while growers in other States produced
a total of about 40 million pounds. Statistics on the number of domestic growers of Fuji apples and their sizes are not
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the domestic production of Fuji apples is exported because demand, and consequently the price, for Fuji apples
is quite low in the United States as compared to other countries, particularly in the Pacific Rim. Prices of $30 to $50
per 40-pound box (depending upon quality) are common in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Pacific Rim markets. Domestic
buyers, however, have been paying less than half that price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Growers in the Republic of Korea produce annually about 923 million pounds of Fuji variety apples. APHIS estimates
that about 220,000 to 440,000 pounds of Fuji variety apples might be exported per year from the Republic of Korea to
the United States. This estimate assumes the Republic of Korea's exports to the United States will approach levels
currently exported to European countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Japanese growers produce annually about 1.18 billion pounds of Fuji variety apples, just over half of Japan's total
annual apple production. APHIS estimates that exports to the United States of all varieties of Japanese apples would
probably never exceed 2.2 million pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is unlikely that imports of Fuji variety apples from Japan and the Republic of Korea will reach the estimated levels
above, due to the low demand and low price for Fuji variety apples in the United States. However, even if imports were
to reach 2.6 million pounds (2.2 million pounds from Japan and 440,000 pounds from the Republic of Korea), this would
constitute less than 1.4 percent of domestic production of Fuji variety apples. Consequently, allowing Fuji variety
apples to be imported from Japan and the Republic of Korea will not have a significant economic impact on domestic Fuji
variety apple producers or other small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

This rule allows Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from Japan and the Republic of Korea under
certain conditions. State and local laws and regulations regarding Fuji variety apples imported under this rule
will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce. Fresh apples are generally imported for immediate distribution
and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question
of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will
be given to this rule; and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court
challenging this rule.

The apples must be inspected upon completion of the treatments required by paragraph (a) of this section, prior to
export from Japan or the Republic of Korea, by an APHIS inspector and an inspector from the national plant protection
agency of Japan or the Republic of Korea. The apples shall be subject to further disinfection in the exporting country
if plant pests are found prior to export. Imported Fuji variety apples inspected in Japan or the Republic of Korea are

Trust fund agreements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The national plant protection agency of the exporting country must enter into a trust fund agreement with APHIS before
APHIS will provide the services necessary for Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from Japan
or the Republic of Korea. The agreement requires the national plant protection agency to pay in advance of each shipping
season all costs that APHIS estimates it will incur in providing services in Japan or the Republic of Korea during that
shipping season. These costs include administrative expenses and all salaries (including overtime and the Federal
share of employee benefits), travel expenses (including per diem expenses), and other incidental expenses incurred
by APHIS in performing these services. The agreement requires the national plant protection agency to deposit a certified
or cashiers check with APHIS for the amount of these costs, as estimated by APHIS. If the deposit is not sufficient to
meet all costs incurred by APHIS, the agreement further requires the national plant protection agency to deposit
with APHIS a certified or cashiers check for the amount of the remaining costs, as determined by APHIS, before APHIS
will provide any more services necessary for Fuji variety apples to be imported into the United States from that country.
After a final audit at the conclusion of each shipping season, any overpayment of funds will be returned to the national
plant protection agency, or held on account until needed, at that agency's option.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending the poultry products inspection regulations to require
the use of numbered official badges to identify persons authorized to conduct Federal inspection under the Poultry
Products Inspection Act. Such persons may be our employees or employees of other Federal agencies or State agencies
working under agreements with us. The amendment confirms our current practice of issuing badges to such persons and
removes an inconsistency between the meat and the poultry products inspection regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA_21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA_21 U.S.C. 451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Secretary of Agriculture is responsible for carrying out inspection programs for assuring that meat, meat
food, and poultry products prepared for distribution in commerce are safe, not adulterated, and properly marked,
labeled, and packaged. The Secretary is required to staff the programs with persons appointed for the purpose of conducting
ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection of livestock and poultry; inspection of facilities, equipment, and sanitation
at official establishments; and inspection of further processing of meat and poultry. Under regulations implementing
the FMIA and PPIA, persons authorized to conduct inspection in meat and poultry slaughtering and further processing
establishments are provided with appropriate identification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal meat inspection regulations have long required the use of a numbered official badge to identify each Federal
meat inspector who is entitled to enter the premises of official establishments to conduct inspection. Since the
merger of the meat and poultry inspection programs in the early 1970's, the badge has also been used to identify poultry
inspectors carrying out mandatory inspection under the PPIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The poultry products inspection regulations currently require that inspectors have with them at all times the ``means
of identification'' furnished to them by the Department. The regulations have also required that ``licenses'' be
issued to persons carrying out Federal poultry inspection under agreements with State or other agencies. These requirements
originated in the era when the inspection of poultry for condition and wholesomeness was one of the Department's voluntary
inspection and certification programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA administered voluntary poultry inspection in cooperation with State and other agencies, with poultry processing
establishments paying fees for the service. For much of this work, the Department entered into cooperative agreements
with State agencies whose USDA-licensed personnel operated under USDA supervision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the PPIA was enacted and Federal inspection of poultry products prepared for distribution in commerce became
mandatory, the need for cooperative agreements was reduced. Even so, the mandatory poultry products inspection
regulations that were promulgated in February 1958 (23 FR 731) to implement the PPIA carried over from the earlier
regulations provisions allowing the Secretary to authorize ``licensed'' Federal or State employees to conduct
Federal poultry inspection. Such authorized State personnel have performed Federal inspection according to Federal-State
agreements concluded under the Talmadge-Aiken Act of 1962 (7 U.S.C. 450). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the meat and poultry inspection programs were merged, poultry inspectors who were USDA employees used Department
identification cards as their means of identification. Employees of cooperating Federal or State agencies who were
authorized to conduct Federal poultry inspection were issued license cards. The license cards for the State employees
thus served the same purpose as USDA identification cards of Federal poultry inspectors and the badges of Federal
meat inspectors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1972, FSIS amended the poultry products inspection regulations to implement the Wholesome Poultry Products
Act of 1968. The amendments reflected the organizational merger of poultry and meat inspection. Since that time,
poultry inspection has been administered in the same way as meat inspection. The same method of credentialling_the
badge_is used for both meat and poultry inspectors; State employees performing Federal inspection under ``Talmadge-Aiken''
agreements also are issued Federal inspection badges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the Agency is removing and reserving section 381.30 of the poultry products inspection regulations to
delete the requirement for issuance of a license to non-USDA employees who are authorized to conduct Federal poultry
inspection. Section 381.31, which governs conditions for expiration, suspension, and revocation of licenses,
is also being deleted. The suspension and revocation provisions of this section have not been invoked since the merger
of the meat and poultry inspection programs. The qualifications and conditions of service of non-USDA employees
who are authorized to conduct Federal poultry inspection are contained in the agreements between FSIS and cooperating
agencies. Finally, the Agency is revising section 381.33, concerning identification of inspectors, to require
the use of the numbered official inspection badge for such identification.

Executive Order 12866

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been determined to be not significant for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not
been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

Executive Order 12778 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) preempts
all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3)
does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.

Effect on Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Acting Administrator, FSIS, has determined that this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this amendment is an amendment of Agency procedure, with nugatory public impact, this rulemaking is exempted
under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA_5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A)) from the requirement for notice and opportunity
for public comment. Similarly, because this amendment concerns only Agency procedure and is without measurable
public impact, this rulemaking is exempt for good cause from the APA requirement that a substantive rule be published
30 days prior to its effective date (5 U.S.C. 553(d)).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Airworthiness directive (AD) 94&hyph;15&hyph;02, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment 39&hyph;8973, applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 20, 1994 (59 FR 36932). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other things, that AD requires inspections to verify the installation and tightness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shear pins, shear pin retainers, and shear pin retainer attaching parts in the aft end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the center pylon thrust link, and repair, if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As published, paragraph (a)(3) of that AD contained a reference to McDonnell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Douglas MD&hyph;11 Alert Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, as a source of service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information related to accomplishing a repair of the shear pin retainer and attaching parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to a typographical error, the issue date of that service bulletin was listed as ``June 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994,'' rather than the correct date of ``June 3, 1993.'' (This date was cited correctly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, in other portions of the rule that contained references to this same service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulletin.) As a result, the service bulletin referenced in paragraph (a)(3) of the published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD does not exist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since it is essential that operators perform repairs in accordance with appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and available service instructions, this document changes the issue date of the service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bulletin cited in paragraph (a)(3) of AD 94&hyph;15&hyph;02, amendment 39&hyph;8973, to read as: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``June 3, 1993.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effective date of the rule remains August 19, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC''), subject to the conditions specified below,
is expanding the category of persons to whom firms operating pursuant to the Limited Marketing Order issued on October
28, 1992 may direct limited marketing conduct with respect to foreign futures or option contracts within the United
States through their employees or other representatives. The relief as originally issued was limited to conduct
directed towards institutions and governmental entities identified in condition 5 of the Limited Marketing Order
whose description in terms of status and assets has been derived generally from the definition of ``qualified eligible
participant'' (``QEP'') as that term is defined in Commission rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 4.7(a)(1)(ii). This Order
will expand the relief to conduct directed towards all ``accredited investors'' as that term is defined in the Securities
and Exchange Commission's (``SEC'') Regulation D issued pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 28, 1992, the Commission issued an Order under rule 30.10, 17 CFR 30.10, to permit firms that have received
rule 30.10 relief, to engage in limited marketing conduct with respect to foreign futures or option contracts within
the United States through their employees or other representatives. 57 FR 49644 (November 3, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among other conditions,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 the Order provided that such solicitation or marketing activities occurring within the United States be limited
to such activities directed towards certain institutions and governmental entities whose description in terms
of status and assets has been derived generally from the definition of QEP as that term is defined in Commission rule
4.7(a)(1)(ii), 17 CFR 4.7(a)(1)(ii). The Commission noted that the Order was a first step and that absent any problems
that would warrant a reconsideration of the appropriateness of permitting rule 30.10 firms to operate in accordance
with the Order, the Commission may in due course expand the scope of the relief. Upon consideration of the matter, in
particular, that no issues have arisen in connection with the operation of the Limited Marketing Order in the two years
since its issuance, the CFTC is amending condition (5) of the Order issued on October 28, 1992 expanding the relief
to be generally consistent with the term ``accredited investors'' as defined in section 230.501(a) of Securities
Exchange Commission Regulation D promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, 17 CFR 230.501(a), who are not
already included within the scope of current condition (5) of the Limited Marketing Order.

The Limited Marketing Order also required that the regulatory or self-regulatory organization to which the Commission
issued 30.10 relief or its equivalent obtain written confirmation from the Commission that the Order applies to such
rule 30.10 order. To date, the following regulatory or self-regulatory organizations have requested and received
confirmation from the Commission that the Order will apply to their members: 1) Commission des Operations de Bourse
(December 4, 1992); 2) The Securities and Investment Board (December 30, 1992); 3) Investment Management Regulatory
Organisation (December 30, 1992); 4) Securities and Futures Authority (December 30, 1992); 5) The Montreal Exchange
(February 10, 1993); and 6) Sydney Futures Exchange (June 30, 1993). In this connection, the Commission would need
to confirm the application of this expanded relief to each of the organizations referred to above.

The Department of State is amending the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120&hyph;130) (ITAR)
to reflect that it is no long the policy of the United states to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports
of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in South Africa. The regulations are also amended
to add Rwanda to the list of states for which such a policy of denial is in effect. A new provision is added to indicate
that whenever the United Nations Security Council imposes an arms embargo, all transactions which involve defense
articles and services and which are prohibited by the embargo are prohibited under the ITAR.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of State is amending &sect;126.1(a) and striking &sect;126.1(c) of the ITAR to reflect that it is no
longer the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense articles
and services, destined for or originating in South Africa. With respect to South Africa, all requests for licenses
or other approvals involving items covered by the U.S. Munitions List (22 CFR part 121) will now be reviewed on a case-by-case
basis. This policy change was announced in a notice published at 59 FR 31667 on June 20, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The arms export embargo on South Africa was imposed by the U.N. Security Council in Resolution 418 of November 4, 1977.
An arms import embargo was called for by Security Council Resolution 558 of December 13, 1984. The Security Council
terminated both embargoes in U.N. Security Council Resolution 919 of May 25, 1994. The Council's actions follow the
first all-race multiparty election and the establishment of a democratic South African Government inaugurated
on May 10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 126.1(a) is also amended to add Rwanda to the list of countries with respect to which the United States maintains
an arms embargo. It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses, other approvals, exports and imports of defense
articles and services, destined for or originating in Rwanda. This policy was announced in a notice published at 59
FR 28583 on June 2, 1994. This policy and amendment implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 918 of May 17, 1994,
which requires all states to prevent the sale or supply to Rwanda of arms and related material, and Executive Order
12918 of May 26, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Licenses and approvals subject to the South Africa and Rwanda policies include manufacturing licenses, technical
assistance agreements, technical data, and commercial military exports and reexports of any kind involving these
countries under the authority of the Arms Export Control Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new section 126.1(c) is added to indicate that whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates an arms embargo,
all transactions which are prohibited by the embargo and which involve U.S. persons anywhere, or any person in the
United States, and defense articles and services of a type enumerated on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part
121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the embargo, unless the Department
of State publishes a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 specifying different measures. This would include, but is not limited to, transactions involving trade by U.S. persons
who are located inside or outside of the United States in defense articles and services of U.S. or foreign origin which
are located on U.S. territory or elsewhere.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment involves a foreign affairs function of the United States. It is exempt from review under Executive
Order 12866 but has been reviewed internally by the Department to ensure consistency with the purposes thereof. It
is also excluded from the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 553 and 554.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the preamble, and under the authority of section 38 of the Arms Export Control
Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and Executive Order 11958, as amended 22 CFR Subchapter M is amended as follows:

This policy also applies to countries with respect to which the United States maintains an arms embargo (e.g., Burma,
China, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, the former Yugoslavia, and Zaire) or whenever an export would not
otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States. Comprehensive

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Treasury decision will authorize the removal of imported alcoholic beverage products from Customs custody
in conformity with certificates of label approval signed by ATF specialists. Currently, ATF specialists issue label
approvals by affixing the Director's name to each application. This Treasury decision will eliminate from 27 CFR
&sect;&sect;4.40(b) (wine), 5.51(b) (distilled spirits), and 7.31(b) (malt beverages) the requirement that certificates
of label approval bear the signature of the Director. This change will streamline internal procedures and improve
resource management.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 205(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 U.S.C. 205(e), requires that all distilled
spirits, wine, and malt beverage products have either a certificate of label approval or a certificate of exemption
from label approval prior to bottling, or in the case of imported products, prior to removal from Customs custody.
Section 205(e) grants authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to issue certificates of label approval in such manner
and in such form as prescribed by regulation. The Secretary has delegated authority to administer the FAA Act to the
Director, ATF, including the issuance of certificates of label approval. See 37 FR 11696 (June 6, 1972).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under an existing delegation order, ATF specialists issue label approvals and exemptions from label approvals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for both domestic and imported products in the name of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director. ATF is currently revising this delegation order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to authorize specialists within the Product Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Branch to approve labels and grant exemptions in their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
names. However, the regulations at 27 CFR 4.40(b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.51(b), and 7.31(b) specifically require that certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of label approval (ATF Form 5100.31) bear the signature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Director before imported alcoholic beverage products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be released from Customs custody. This Treasury decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will amend these regulations so that the Director may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegate to Product Compliance Branch specialists the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to approve labels for imported products in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own names.

The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,

Public Law 96&hyph;511, 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35, and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required by

5 U.S.C. 553 or any other law, the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et. seq.) do not

Section 0.64&hyph;1 of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, authorizes the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division to act as the Central or Competent Authority under treaties and executive agreements between
the United States and other countries on mutual assistance in criminal matters. Section 0.64&hyph;1, as amended,
also authorizes the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division to redelegate this authority to
her Deputy Assistant Attorneys General and to the Director and Deputy Directors of the Office of International Affairs.
This final rule amends the Appendix to Subpart K of Part 0. The purpose is to effectuate 28 CFR 0.64&hyph;1, as amended,
by formally redelegating the authority of the Assistant Attorney General under both treaties and executive agreements
on mutual assistance in criminal matters to designated individuals within the Criminal Division.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In Directive No. 81 in the Appendix to Subpart K of Part 0, as currently written, the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division has redelegated her authority to act as the Central or Competent Authority under treaties
on mutual assistance in criminal matters to her Deputy Assistant Attorneys General and to the Director of the Office
of International Affairs. This final rule extends the redelegation of such authority to each of the Deputy Directors
of the Office of International Affairs, Criminal Division. This final rule also expands the scope of that redelegation
to match the scope of 28 CFR 0.64&hyph;1, which encompasses executive agreements, as well as treaties, on mutual assistance
in criminal matters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is a matter of internal Department management. It has been drafted and reviewed in accordance with section
1(b) of Executive Order 12866. The Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division has determined that this
rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and accordingly this
rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal
Division has reviewed this rule, and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government
and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore,
in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications
to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) debentures have been issued since 1938 in registered certificated form in
payment of certain insured mortgages in default. FHA debentures are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest
by the United States. The Treasury acts as the fiscal agent of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
in administering its debenture issues. The general regulations of the Department of the Treasury governing U.S.
securities (31 CFR Part 306) have been adopted by HUD to govern transactions in its debentures. The Treasury regulations
at 31 CFR part 337 supplement the general regulations, setting out provisions that apply specifically to the debentures.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1986, the Department of the Treasury began issuing its marketable securities exclusively in book-entry form.
This action was taken as book-entry technology was determined to be quicker, more efficient, and less costly than
issuing certificated securities. To take advantage of this technology, HUD successfully secured legislation,
i.e., the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;550, &sect;516, 106 Stat. 3790 (1992),
authorizing the issuance of FHA debentures in book-entry form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule revises and expands 31 CFR Part 337 to include provisions relating to book-entry debentures. Book-entry
debentures will be governed by the rules for the TREASURY DIRECT Book-Entry Securities System (31 CFR part 357) with
several exceptions which reflect the unique nature of the debentures. First, book-entry debentures, unlike Treasury's
book-entry marketable securities, may not be transferred to, or held in, Treasury's commercial book-entry system;
they may be transferred only between accounts in the FHA book-entry debenture system. Second, while debenture payments
will be made by the direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) method, prenotification messages or test payment
messages will not be used to verify payment instructions since accurate payment information will have entities seeking
settlement of defaulted insured mortgages. Third, since debentures are issued in settlement of defaulted mortgages
rather than through an auction process, no issue price information will be maintained for the debentures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Book-entry debentures will be maintained in the FHA book-entry debenture system operated for Treasury by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia acting as fiscal agent of the United States. Debentures in certificated form may be exchanged
for similar debentures in book-entry form, but, once exchanged, may not be reissued in certificated form. Debentures
issued in book-entry form may not be exchanged for debentures in certificated form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also revises 31 CFR Part 337 to reflect the centralization of processing of debentures in both certificated
and book-entry form at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and to eliminate the obsolete requirement that the
registered owner or assignee must assign certificated debentures presented for redemption when payment is to be
made to the registered owner or assignee.

Special Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that the rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive
Order No. 12866. It has also been determined that prior notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary and impracticable
because the rule sets out procedures that merely implement legislation authorizing the issuance of debentures in
book-entry form. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

War Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, Military Housing Insurance Fund Debentures, and National Defense Housing
Insurance Fund Debentures. In accordance with the regulations adopted by the Federal Housing Commissioner and approved
by the Secretary of the Treasury, such transactions are governed by regulations of the Department of the Treasury,
so far as applicable.

by registered mail, but for the owner's protection debentures bearing unrestricted assignments should be forwarded
by insured registered mail. Debentures should be delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Securities
Division, Ten Independence Mall, P.O. Box 90, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19105&hyph;0090. Debentures delivered
to any other Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or to the Bureau

Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued
interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. No transfers or denominational exchanges in certificated
debentures covered by a given call will be made on the books of the Department of the Treasury on or after the announcement
of such call. However, this does not affect the right of a holder of such debenture to sell and assign it on or after the
announcement of the call date.

To facilitate the redemption of called or maturing debentures, they may be presented and surrendered in the manner
prescribed in this section in advance of the call or maturity date, as the case may be. Early presentation by holders
will insure prompt payment of principal and interest when due. The debentures must first be assigned by the registered
payee or his assignee, or by his duly constituted representative, if required, in the form and manner indicated in
&sect;337.5, and should then be submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, accompanied by appropriate
written advice. A transmittal advice for this purpose will accompany the notice of call.

for any reason that payment be made to another, without intermediate assignment, the debentures should be assigned
to ``The Federal Housing Commissioner for redemption (or, purchase) for the account of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

should be avoided unless the owner is willing to lose the protection afforded by registration.

When certificated debentures are tendered for purchase prior to maturity in order that the proceeds thereof be applied

of the mortgage insurance premium will generally be issued to the owner in the form of a book-entry debenture in the
exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more. However, if the owner so requests, such
difference will be settled with certificated debenture(s), together with a cash adjustment, if any. Such request
should be made in writing, before the book-entry debenture in the amount of the difference is issued.

 Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued
interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. For purposes of a transaction request affecting ownership
and/or payment instructions with respect to a debenture announced for call, a proper request must be received not
less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding the next payment date. If the twentieth day preceding a payment date
falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the last day set for the receipt of a transaction request will be the
last business day preceding that date. If a transaction request is received less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding
a payment date, the Department may, in its discretion, act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing.
If a transaction request is received too late for completion of the requested transaction, principal and final interest
on the called debentures will be paid to the owner of record and sent to the payment address of record.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 15, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and the
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD). This approval action will incorporate these rules into
the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised
rules control emissions of VOCs from the transfer of gasoline into storage or fuel tanks, and from crude oil and natural
gas production and processing facilities. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for
national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 15, 1994 in 59 FR 11958, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SCAQMD Rule 461,
Gasoline Transfer and Dispensing, and VCAPCD Rule 74.10, Components at Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production and Processing
Facilities. Rule 461 was adopted by the SCAQMD on July 7, 1989, and submitted by the California Air Resources Board
(CARB) to EPA on December 31, 1990. Rule 74.10 was adopted by the VCAPCD on June 16, 1992 and submitted by the CARB on September
14, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement
that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance
with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background
for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 11958 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Response to Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 11958. EPA did not receive any comments regarding these rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing this action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the
submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval
action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules
is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

I. Background

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions the CAA will require regulation of many small businesses so that areas may attain
and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. Small businesses
frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary to evaluate such regulations and to determine
the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses,
the CAA requires that states adopt a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs EPA to oversee
these small business assistance programs and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing
a PROGRAM
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are set out in section 507 of title V of the CAA. In February 1992, EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 22, 1993, the District of Columbia submitted a formal revision to its SIP. The SIP revision consists of a
plan for establishing a PROGRAM. In order to gain full approval, the District's submittal must provide for each of
the following program elements: (1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical
and compliance assistance to small businesses; (2) the establishment of a District Small Business Ombudsman to represent
the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and (3) the creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP)
to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP. The plan must include the duties, funding, and schedule
of implementation for the three program components. The plan must also determine the eligibility of small business
stationary sources for assistance in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) and Ombudsman was adopted
and will be implemented pursuant to the authority vested in the Mayor by section 422(6) of the District of Columbia
Self Government and Governmental Reorganization Act of 1973, as amended (1992), D.C. Code sections 1&hyph;242 (6),
(11) and (12), 6&hyph;901, 6&hyph;902 and 6&hyph;903. The creation and administration of the Compliance Advisory
Panel will be accomplished by Mayoral order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Milestones for implementing the essential elements of the District's PROGRAM are included as part of the SIP revision
submittal. The District has committed to establishing a SBAP, administered by the Air Resources Management Division
of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by September 1, 1993. In January, 1994 the District appointed a
small business representative to coordinate SBAP activities. Eligibility for assistance under the SBAP will be
determined by the criteria outlined in the PROGRAM submittal. Full SBAP implementation will begin no later than November
15, 1994. The District has committed to establishing an Ombudsman's office, to be located in the Office of the Administrator
of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by September 1, 1993. The Ombudsman will complete the first annual
review of the SBAP by November 15, 1994. A Mayoral Order establishing the creation and administration of the Compliance
Advisory Panel was issued on November 3, 1992. The District has committed to convening its CAP by June 1, 1993. The CAP
will submit its first annual report to EPA by November 15, 1994.

II. Analysis of SIP Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(a) of the CAA sets forth seven requirements that the District must meet to have an approvable SBAP. Six
of the requirements will be discussed in this section of this document, while the seventh requirement, establishment
of a state Small Business Ombudsman, will be discussed in the next section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Small Business Assistance Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first requirement is to establish adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information
concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage
lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further compliance with the CAA. The second requirement
is to establish adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention
and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies,
process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution. The District has met these requirements
by establishing a SBAP, administered by the District of Columbia Air Resources Management Division (ARMD). The ARMD
SBAP has the responsibility of collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and acceptable
control technologies for small business stationary sources. The ARMD will also work closely with the Office of Emergency
Preparedness and other District organizations in coordinating information exchange regarding alternative technologies,
process changes, products and other methods of pollution prevention and accidental release prevention and detection.
The dissemination of SBAP information shall take two forms. Technical and compliance information will be disseminated
to small businesses in a proactive manner via press releases, brochures and other media as necessary. Additionally,
``outreach'' programs such as conferences or meetings with Advisory Neighborhood Commissioners, small businesses,
and/or trade associations, etc. may be utilized. The SBAP will also disseminate information in a reactive manner
via an established telephone hotline and information clearinghouse which will be capable of handling inquires from
the small business community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third requirement is to develop a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary
sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable requirements and in receiving permits under the
CAA in a timely and efficient manner. The SBAP will work closely with the staff of the ARMD Engineering and Planning
Branch and Compliance and Enforcement Branch to help sources identify applicable requirements and obtain permits.
Specifically, the SBAP will be responsible for providing advice and assistance to small businesses in the interpretation
of regulatory requirements, explaining permitting procedures and providing information regarding fees, when
and where to apply, the length of time necessary to receive a permit, etc. Additional responsibilities include helping
small businesses determine if they qualify for reduced fees under the waiver provisions of the title V Operating Permit
Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive
notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to
evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under
the CAA. The fifth requirement is to develop adequate mechanisms for informing small business stationary sources
of their obligations under the CAA, including mechanisms for referring such sources to qualified auditors or, at
the option of the state, for providing audits of the operations of such sources to determine compliance with the CAA.
The SBAP is responsible for notifying eligible sources of their statutory and regulatory rights and obligations
under the Clean Air Act in a timely fashion. Such communication will include explaining fine and permit policies,
the consequences of operating in violation of regulations, and appeal procedures. In addition, the District's SBAP
will administer an audit program which provides technical assistance on pollution prevention or control options.
Environmental professionals from the Compliance and Enforcement Branch and the Engineering and Planning Branch
of the ARMD are to serve as auditors for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth requirement is to develop procedures for consideration of requests from a small business stationary source
for modification of: (A) Any work practice or technological method of compliance; or (B) the schedule of milestones
for implementing such work practices or compliance methods preceding any applicable compliance date. The SBAP will
meet this requirement by developing procedures, in accordance with section 507(a)(7) of the CAA, for handling requests
from small businesses for modifications of work practices or alternative air pollution control methods. The District
has committed to establishing such procedures by November 15, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An ARMD program analyst, authorized to report directly to the Program Manager of the Air Resources Management Division,
is responsible for the development and initiation of SBAP programs. As SBAP programs are developed, additional staff
will be hired as required. The SBAP will be funded by District of Columbia and/or Federal air pollution control grant
funds until the effective date of implementation of the District's title V Operating Permits Program. After the effective
date, the District's SBAP will be funded by District of Columbia funds appropriated from the revenues generated by
fees required by the title V Operating Permits Program.

2. Ombudsman Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The seventh requirement of section 507(a)(3) is the designation of a state office to serve as the Ombudsman for small
business stationary sources in connection with the implementation of the CAA. The District's Ombudsman will work
in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration as a member of the Administrator's
staff. Consequently, the Ombudsman will be in an effective position to represent the views and interests of the small
business community on issues concerning the implementation of the CAA. The Ombudsman will have direct access to the
Program Manager of the ARMD and his/her superior, the Administrator. In this position, the Ombudsman can easily evaluate
the District's SBAP, investigate and resolve disputes between businesses and air pollution control authorities,
develop and propose legislation, and actively promote the small business point-of-view. The Ombudsman will also
have access to the Director of the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, the Office of the Corporation Counsel,
and the Office of the Mayor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A listing of the Ombudsman's duties indicate that it will be readily accessible to small businesses and, on their behalf,
be authorized to provide reports to and to communicate with appropriate personnel. The Ombudsman will also distribute
the District's CAP reports and advisory opinions and provide administrative support to the CAP. The District has
committed to hiring a program analyst to serve as the Small Business Ombudsman. Additional staff for the Office of
the Ombudsman will be recruited as necessary. The Ombudsman will be funded with District of Columbia appropriated
funds. After the effective date of the District's title V Operating Permits Program, the Ombudsman and his or her staff
may be funded by appropriations from revenues of the District's title V Operating Permits Program.

3. Compliance Advisory Panel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(e) of the CAA requires each state to establish a Compliance Advisory Panel that includes two members selected
by the Governor (or equivalent) who are not owners or representatives of owners of small business stationary sources;
four members selected by the state legislature (or equivalent) who are owners, or represent owners, of small businesses;
and one member selected by the head of the agency in charge of the air pollution permit program. The District has committed
to creating a compliance advisory panel. The composition of the District's CAP is in accordance with the method of
selection required by section 507(e)(2) of the CAA for a unicameral legislature. All CAP members, with the exception
of the representative of the Air Resources Management Division, a District of Columbia employee, will be unpaid appointees.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to establishing the minimum membership of the CAP the CAA delineates certain responsibilities of the
panel. A description of the duties and authorities delegated to the District's Compliance Advisory Panel indicates
that it will be responsible for all activities required by section 507(e). These activities include rendering advisory
opinions on the effectiveness of the small business ombudsman and SBAP and preparing periodic reports to EPA concerning
the effectiveness of the PROGRAM following the intent of the Federal Paperwork Reduction Act, the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, and the Equal Access to Justice Act. The CAP will also be responsible for reviewing information disseminated
to small business stationary sources to assure such information is understandable to laypersons.

4. Source Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 507(c)(1) of the CAA defines the term ``small business stationary source'' as a stationary source that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Is owned or operated by a person who employs 100 or fewer individuals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is a small business concern as defined in the Small Business Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not a major stationary source; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Does not emit 50 tons per year (tpy) or more of any regulated pollutant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Emits less than 75 tpy of all regulated pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District's program definition of the term ``small business stationary source'' is identical to the statutory
definition found in section 507(c). All small business stationary sources located in the District shall be eligible
to receive assistance from the SBAP. Any source which does not meet the criteria in (C), (D), and (E) above but does not
emit more than 100 tons per year of all regulated pollutants may petition the District of Columbia to be included in
the SBAP. The District may, after public notice and opportunity for public comment, permit such a source to participate
in the SBAP even though the source does not meet the criteria given above.

III. Summary of SIP Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The District has submitted a SIP revision which fully implements each of the program elements required by CAA section
507. As previously stated, the District has committed to fully implementing its SBAP, administered by the Air Resources
Management Division of the Environmental Regulation Administration, by November 15, 1994. The District's Ombudsman,
located in the Office of the Administrator of the Environmental Regulation Administration, shall complete its first
annual review of the SBAP, by November 15, 1994. The District's CAP, authorized by Mayoral Order, shall complete its
first annual review of the SBAP and Ombudsman and submit it to EPA by November 15, 1994. In this action, EPA is approving
the SIP revision submittal by the District of Columbia. Accordingly, &sect;52.510 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart
J&hyph;District of Columbia to reflect EPA's approval action and the fact that it is considered part of the District
of Columbia SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will become effective October 17, 1994 unless, within 30 days of publication, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on October 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the District of Columbia's plan for the establishment of a Small Business Stationary Source Technical
and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. Accordingly, &sect;52.510 is added to 40 CFR part 52, subpart
J&hyph;District of Columbia to reflect EPA's approval action. EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved
state implementation plan for conformance with the CAA including section 507 and section 110(a)(2)(E).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, EPA is approving a state program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. The program being approved does not impose any new regulatory
burden on small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance
provided by the state. Therefore, because EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small
entities affected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2).)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA redesignates Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment status for carbon monoxide. The State
of Wisconsin requested this redesignation and provided the necessary monitoring data for USEPA to approve the change.
The redesignation has no substantive effect because unclassifiable areas are subject to the same requirements as
attainment areas. Elsewhere in this

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In November 1991, USEPA designated Oshkosh, Wisconsin as an unclassifiable area for carbon monoxide (56 FR 56850)
because the available air quality data was not representative of air quality at the date of enactment of the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments. Exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for carbon monoxide had been
recorded in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in late 1988 and early 1989, but the emissions causing the exceedances were brought
under control later in 1989. These controls were approved by USEPA and incorporated into the State Implementation
Plan on October 8, 1992 (57 FR 46309). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin's current request, submitted on April 7, 1994, is to change the designation of Oshkosh from unclassifiable
to attainment based on recent ambient air quality measurements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Evaluation of State Submission
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Procedural Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Redesignation requests are processed under section 107(d)(3) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). While section 107(d)(3)(E)
specifies a number of requirements for areas requesting redesignation from nonattainment to attainment, the redesignation
of unclassifiable areas is not explicitly addressed. However, the general criteria governing designations, set
forth in section 107(d)(1)(A), do apply. Therefore, to qualify an unclassified area for redesignation to attainment,
the State must show that the area has attained the relevant standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a carbon monoxide area to be designated as attainment for a pollutant, it must meet the NAAQS for that pollutant
(40 CFR part 50), based on the most recent two years of data. In its redesignation request, Wisconsin submitted carbon
monoxide data for Oshkosh from January 24, 1992 to January 31, 1994 (when the monitor was shut down). Wisconsin collected
the air quality data as required in the 1992 SIP revision and under procedures in accordance with the USEPA's monitoring
requirements set forth in 40 CFR part 58. This data has been entered into USEPA's Aerometric Information Retrieval
System (AIRS) and is summarized in USEPA's Technical Support Document for this action (M. Beardsley to Files, July
20, 1994). The data show that Oshkosh is well under the NAAQS for carbon monoxide concentrations and, thus, meets the
requirements for attainment status. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA redesignates the City of Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment for carbon monoxide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial, we are approving it without prior proposal. This action will
become effective on October 17, 1994. However, if we receive adverse or critical comments by September 16, 1994, USEPA
will publish a document that withdraws today's action and will address all public comments in a subsequent final rule
based on the proposal published in the proposed rule section. The public comment period will not be extended or reopened.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Exectutive Order 12866 review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This redesignation does not create any new requirements. Therefore, I certify that this action does not have a significant
impact on any small entities affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Petitions for Judicial Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States
Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 17, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator
of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the
time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule
or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This action announces a three-month stay of certain federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofit of appliances
containing ozone-depleting substances contained in the regulations implementing the National Recycling Program.
The effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment only, including
the applicable compliance dates, is stayed for three months pending reconsideration. EPA is issuing this stay pursuant
to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay
the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1993, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) sent to the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) a petition for reconsideration of the Refrigerant Recycling Rule, promulgated May 14, 1993, (58 FR 28660),
particularly the leak repair provisions under 40 CFR 82.156(i) as they concern industrial process refrigeration
equipment
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
. On that same date, CMA filed a petition in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking
review of this Refrigerant Recycling Rule (

D.C. Cir. Docket 93&hyph;1444.) As part of a settlement agreement signed by EPA and the CMA on May 20, 1994, EPA agreed
to propose changes to the appropriate sections of the rules. A 113(g) notice of the settlment agreement was published
on June 14, 1994 (59 FR 30584).

Industrial process refrigeration is defined in &sect;82.152(g) of the final regulations (58 FR 28713). The definition
states that ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
industrial process refrigeration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 means, for the purposes of &sect;82.156(i), complex customized appliances used in the chemical, pharmaceutical,
petrochemical and manufacturing industries. This sector also includes industrial ice machines and ice rinks.''

The settlement agreement set a tight deadline for the completion of rulemaking, requiring EPA to propose changes
by September 1, 1994, and to promulgate amended regulations by June 1, 1995. By this action, EPA is convening a proceeding
for reconsideration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Final regulations published on May 14, 1993 (58 FR 28660), establish a recycling program for ozone-depleting refrigerants
recovered during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. Together with the
prohibition on venting during the service, repair, and disposal of class I and class II substances (see the listing
notice January 22, 1991; 56 FR 2420) that took effect on July 1, 1992, these regulations should substantially reduce
the emissions of ozone-depleting refrigerants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition filed by the CMA asks for reconsideration of leak repair provisions under &sect;82.156(i) as they relate
to industry process refrigeration equipment. In particular, the petitioners raised concerns regarding the ability
to repair or retrofit some industrial process refrigeration equipment within the timeframes established by the
final rule. CMA's concerns involve the need to shut down equipment and/or obtain custom built parts within the appropriate
timeframes. CMA also raised the possibility of delays caused by other regulatory requirements related to changes
at plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated CMA's information and is now reconsidering the leak repair provisions in light of this information.
Moreover, EPA believes that this information warrants review and response pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the
Clean Air Act. In order to review and evaluate the ability of the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration
equipment to comply with the leak repair provisions when extenuating circumstances exist, EPA will reconsider the
regulatory requirements applicable to repairing leaks in accordance with section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Issuance of Stay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA hereby issues a three-month administrative stay of the effectiveness of provisions of &sect;82.156(i) as they
apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment, including all applicable compliance dates, promulgated
as final federal rules requiring the reduction of emissions of ozone-depleting substances during the servicing
and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment (58 FR 28660). EPA will reconsider these rules, as
discussed above and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take
appropriate action. If, after reconsideration of these provisions, EPA determines that it is appropriate to impose
leak repair requirements that are stricter than the existing rules, EPA will propose an adequate compliance period
from the date of final action on reconsideration. EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced
by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate
compliance period would be subject to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the settlement agreement between EPA and CMA set a tight deadline for the completion of the rulemaking, EPA
will reconsider the rules in question as expeditiously as practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Authority for Stay and Reconsideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative stay and reconsideration of the rules and associated compliance periods announced by this notice
are being undertaken pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B). That provision
authorizes the Administrator to stay the effectiveness of a rule for three months if it was impracticable to raise
an objection or if the grounds for an objection arose after the period for public comment and if the objection is of central
relevance to the outcome of the rule. Because some of the issues in the petition for reconsideration may have been impracticable
to raise during the comment period, EPA is authorized to stay the effectiveness of the relevant provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA may not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules stayed
by this notice within the three-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete
the reconsideration in this timeframe, then it might be appropriate to extend temporarily the stay of the effectiveness
of the leak repair requirements for industrial process refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA
completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration. EPA is going through notice and comment rulemaking to decide
whether to extend the stay beyond this initial three-month period. In the Proposed Rules Section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months, only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration
of the rules in question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action will become final on September 16, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) determines endangered status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act
of 1973, as amended (Act) for the plant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(western lily). This lily is known to occur in 31 small, widely separated populations in sphagnum bogs, coastal scrub
and prairie, and other poorly drained soils along the coast of southern Oregon and northern California. Threats to
the species include development (e.g., roads, cranberry farms, buildings, and associated infrastructure), competition
from encroaching shrubs and trees into lily habitat, bulb collecting, and grazing by domestic livestock and deer.
Human activities have interrupted natural processes of bog and wetland creation and maintenance, so that there are
fewer bogs in early successional stages suitable for this lily. This rule implements the Federal protection and recovery
provisions provided by the Act for this species.

Lilium occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(western lily) from unspecified locations in the headlands around Humboldt Bay, California (Purdy 1897). There
are no other taxonomic treatments of this lily. Some researchers have speculated that separate Oregon and California
varieties of the lily may exist (Ballantyne 1980). The variation between lilies in these two regions is now believed
to be due to environmental differences; i.e. wetter (bog) sites and drier (coastal prairie) sites, and not geographic
variation (Mark Skinner, California Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1991). In some instances,

Lilium occidentale, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a perennial in the lily family (Liliaceae), grows from a short unbranched, rhizomatous bulb, reaching a height of
up to 1.8 meters (5 feet (ft)). Leaves grow along the unbranched stem singly or in whorls and are long and pointed, roughly
1 centimeter (cm) wide and 10 cm long (0.5 inch (in) by 4 in). The nodding flowers are red, sometimes deep orange, with
yellow to green centers in the shape of a star and spotted with purple. The six petals (tepals) are 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1.5 in)
long and curve strongly backwards. This species can be distinguished from similar native lilies by the combination
of pendent red flowers with yellow to green centers in the shape of a star, highly reflexed petals, non-spreading stamens
closely surrounding the pistil, and an unbranched rhizomatous bulb.

Lilium occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has an extremely restricted distribution within 2 miles (3.2 kilometers (km)) of the coast from Hauser, Coos County,
Oregon to Loleta, Humboldt County, California. This range encompasses approximately the southern one-third of
the Oregon coast and the northern 100 miles (161 km) of the California coast. Its extreme westerly distribution is
the origin of its specific name. The plant is currently known from 7 widely separated regions along the coast, and occurs
in 31 small (2 square meters (2.4 square yards) to 4 hectares (10 acres) in area), isolated, densely clumped populations.
Of the 25 populations known in 1987 and 1988, 9 contained only 2 to 6 plants, 5 contained 10 to 50 plants, 6 contained 51
to 200 plants, 4 contained 201 to 600 plants, and 1 contained almost 1,000 plants (Schultz 1989). At some sites, particularly
the sites with more than 200 plants, the majority of plants were non-flowering, which is probably an indication of
stress (Schultz 1989). Schultz calculated a known population of 661 flowering and at least 2,750 non-flowering plants
in 1988. Since then, an estimated total of 1,000 to 2,000 flowering plants have been discovered at 4 sites near Crescent
City, California, where none were previously known (Dave Imper, Humboldt State University Foundation, pers. comm.,
1991). In addition, a population of about 125 flowering plants was discovered near Brookings, Oregon, in 1991 (Margie
Willis, Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation, pers. comm. 1991), and a population of 13 flowering plants was
discovered near Bandon, Oregon, in 1992. The known populations occur on State of Oregon (15), county (1), private
(15) including 1 site on land owned by The Nature Conservancy, and State of California (2) lands. Two sites span two
ownerships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Oregon, Schultz (1989) identified a 20-mile stretch of coast from Bandon to Cape Blanco as an area likely to contain
undiscovered populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Previously, Ballantyne (1980) searched this area and did not find new populations, but his visit was after flowering
when the plants would have been inconspicuous. It is possible this area may support the lily. In California, little
suitable habitat remains that has not already been surveyed (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1992). The extremely dense
vegetation in the coastal scrub habitat and around bogs makes surveying for the lily difficult.

 has not been widespread in recent times. Historical records indicate that it was once more common than it is today.
After the ice age, rising sea levels flooded marine benches where bogs and coastal scrub would have been more extensive
than today. That may account for the patchiness of its current habitat distribution. It is known or assumed to be extirpated
in at least nine historical sites, due to forest succession, cranberry farm development, livestock grazing, highway
construction, and other development. Its status is uncertain in at least seven other historical sites (Schultz 1989).
These factors continue to threaten the lily, with development taking a primary role. Two known populations near Brookings,
Oregon were partially or totally destroyed by unpermitted development-related wetland fill activity in 1991. The
largest known population and three smaller populations near Crescent City, California are currently threatened
by housing and recreation development (Dave Imper, pers. comm. 1991).

Previous Federal Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal action on this plant began as a result of section 12 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered,
threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented
to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was considered to be endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 1, 1975, the Service published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (40 FR 27823) accepting the report as a petition to list the species within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section
4(b)(3)(A)) of the Act), and giving notice of its intention to review the status of the plant taxa named therein. In
this and subsequent notices, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was treated as under petition for listing as endangered. As a result of that review, on June 16, 1976, the Service published
a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (41 FR 24523) to determine endangered status pursuant to section 4 of the Act for approximately 1,700 vascular plant
species, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. occidentale.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The list of 1,700 plant species was assembled on the basis of comments and data received by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Service in response to House Document No. 94&hyph;51 and the July 1, 1975, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1978, amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn. A 1-year grace period was given
to proposals already over 2-years old. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (44 FR 70796) withdrawing the portion of the June 16, 1976, proposal that had not been made final, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 along with four other proposals that had expired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service published an updated Notice of Review for plants on December 15, 1980 (50 FR 82480) including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as a category 1 species, meaning that the Service had sufficient information to support a proposal for listing. A review
of the information available on this species in 1985 indicated that category 2 status was more appropriate, and the
plant was included as such in the September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526) Notice of Review for plants. Category 2 species are
taxa for which the Service has some information indicating that listing may be warranted, but additional information
on biological vulnerability and threats is needed to support a proposal for listing as threatened or endangered.
In 1989, a status review of the species was completed (Schultz 1989). This report provided the additional information
necessary to elevate the species to a category 1 candidate; it was included as such in the February 21, 1990, Plant Notice
of Review (55 FR 6184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Secretary to make findings on pending petitions within 12 months of their
receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated
as having been newly submitted on that date. On October 13, 1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of this
species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii)
of the Act; notice of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition
to be recycled yearly pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed each year from 1984 through
1991. A proposal to list

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the October 26, 1992, proposed rule and associated notifications, all interested parties were requested to submit
factual reports or information that might contribute to the development of a final listing decision. Appropriate
State agencies, scientific organizations, and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment.
Newspaper notices were published in The Oregonian paper, Portland, Oregon, on November 27, 1992, and The World paper,
Coos Bay, Oregon, on November 25, 1992, which invited general public comment. Three letters were received. Two letters,
both from private citizens, were in support of the listing. One letter, from a local government, questioned whether
there has been enough study on the need to list the species, its habitat requirements, or whether habitat changes such
as cranberry farming may actually benefit the plant.

Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service believes that the status review of the plant was very thorough. All known populations from historical
herbarium collections were checked, and many were found to be extirpated. The restricted habitat requirements of
the species are accurately known, and most suitable habitat has been searched. Additionally, the Service contacted
all individuals knowledgeable about the species prior to proposing it for listing to assess the most current information
about the status of the species. In response to the concern with the ability of the lily to grow in cranberry farms, a
small population of lilies was found in 1992 in an apparently abandoned cranberry bog (Bruce Rittenhouse, Coos Bay
District, Bureau of Land Management, pers. comm.). No populations have been found in active cranberry farms.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be classified as an endangered species. Procedures found at section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations
promulgated to implement the listing provisions (50 CFR part 424) were followed. A species may be determined to be
an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors
and their application to

 existed historically at several sites above Humboldt Bay in northern California. These populations have been extirpated
by development or, in some cases, encroachment by forest. From the 1940's to the present, conversion of bog habitat
to cranberry farms, roads, and residential dwellings has eliminated suitable

 habitat as well as some populations of the plant in the area from Bandon south to Cape Blanco, Oregon (Schultz 1989).
This area contained perhaps the greatest concentration of the species in Oregon 40 to 50 years ago, according to native
plant collectors and old-time residents of the area (Ballantyne 1980). In 1988, this area contained 6 small populations
with a total of fewer than 125 flowering plants (Schultz 1989). Clearing and draining along the Elk and Sixes Rivers
in Oregon for livestock grazing have eliminated many of the once numerous populations there (Ballantyne 1980). In
the mid-1960's, the construction of a picnic area and restroom facility in an Oregon State Park destroyed another
population. In the summer of 1987, trail maintenance by a crew from this same State Park destroyed the flowering shoots
of six

 (Schultz 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984, the city of Brookings, Oregon, under an easement permit from the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT),
buried a sewer line along a powerline right-of-way through a lily bog that had contained up to 100 plants (Veva Stansell,
U.S. Forest Service, pers. comm.) The fill eliminated all the

 in a 20-ft (6.1 meter) wide strip, destroying almost half of the available lily habitat. The species that later colonized
the fill, rushes and alder, were not the same as those found in the adjoining bog (e.g., sphagnum and

 sundews) (Schultz 1989). In 1991, the City of Brookings again obtained permission from ODOT to bury a larger sewer
line in the site, widening the destroyed area to approximately 25 ft (7.6 meters). The project was completed without
obtaining proper wetland fill permits (John Craig, Army Corps of Engineers, pers. comm., 1991). It is unlikely that
the filled area will support

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the future (Stewart Schultz, University of British Columbia, pers. comm., 1991). The effects on the hydrology
of the remaining bog are as yet unknown. At a second site, a private developer drained a lily bog that historically contained
about 100 plants, without obtaining a State or Federal permit for the wetland activity. Two lilies were found remaining
between two drainage ditches (Richard Mize, California Native Plant Society, pers. comm., 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Future development activities threaten the remaining sites where 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occurs. The largest known population occurs partly on private land in Crescent City, California. This land has been
surveyed and is platted as a subdivision in city records (Richard Mize, pers. comm., 1991). Other nearby populations
are privately owned and the owner has expressed the desire to develop the land (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1991). The
ODOT is currently planning to widen Highway 101 at another lily site. After the proposed rule was published, ODOT modified
their plans and will avoid the lily population. Such pressure to develop wetland sites occupied by this lily will likely
increase in the future. The lily is limited to habitat very near the coast that is currently undergoing intense development
pressure. The species' bog and coastal prairie/scrub habitat occurs on level marine terraces that are desirable
for coastal development because of the gentle topography and proximity to the ocean.

the population (Ballantyne, 1980). Overcollection continues sporadically at sites in Oregon and California (Schultz
1989). For example, in June 1987, seven bulbs were dug from an Oregon site. Lily breeders collect

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 seed regularly from several sites. Plants near trails and roads are occasionally picked: at least seven plants were
picked in 1985, four to six in 1986, five in 1987, and two in 1988 at a site in Oregon (Schultz 1989).

were publicized.

 if it prevents forest succession (see Factor E); overgrazing by cattle is considered a threat to this plant. Until
recently, livestock overgrazing on the lily and surrounding vegetation was severe at three California ranch sites
(Schultz 1989). The lily population at one ranch was reduced from over 100 flowering individuals in 1984 to fewer than
10 between 1985 and 1988. At another ranch, half of the fruits were grazed by deer and cattle in 1985. By July 1987, cattle
had crushed 32 percent and grazed another 25 percent of 49 flowering shoots. Only 17 intact fruits remained in August
(Imper et al. 1987). Deer and elk herbivory is severe at 3 Oregon sites; 50 to 60 percent of fruit in one population of
about 60 flowering plants were browsed in 1987 and 1988 (Schultz 1989). Unknown vandals destroyed all flowering shoots
at one site in 1980 (Ballantyne 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deer browsing continues to be a threat at the Oregon sites. The fences, however, are not deer-proof and deer are common
at these ranches. Though occurring sporadically, browsing by deer can cause major damage.

.), and is included in the Oregon Wildflower Protection Act (ORS 564.020). In California, the ``take'' of State-listed
plants is prohibited, but the law exempts the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land use change by the
landowner. After the California Department of Fish and Game notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows
on his or her property, State law requires only that the landowner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of
changing the land use to allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 1.5, &sect;1913). In Oregon, the ``take'' of State-listed
plants is prohibited only on State-owned or -leased lands. Enforcement of State endangered species laws is inadequate,
as is evident from the list of recent depredations in Factor C above, and from the ``take'' of lilies by activities of
the city of Brookings on Oregon Department of Transportation land, as described in Factor A above. The seriousness
of the problem of enforcement is underscored by the fact that this lily population on State land was twice subjected
to destruction, although all involved parties were informed of the presence of the rare lily after the first incident.

grows in wetland habitat. Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates
the discharge of fill into the waters of the United States, including wetlands. The Clean Water Act requires project
proponents to notify the Corps and obtain a permit prior to undertaking many activities (e.g., grading, discharge
of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in the fill of wetlands under the Corps' jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit No. 26 (33 CFR 330, Appendix A) to address fill of isolated or headwater wetlands
totalling less than 10 acres. Where fill would adversely modify less than 10 acres of wetland, the Corps circulates
a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties for comment to determine whether or not an
individual permit should be required for a proposed fill activity and associated impacts. The Corps must respond
within 30 days or the proposed activity will be authorized under the nationwide permit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individual permits are required for the discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than
10 acres of wetlands or any size wetland if proposed or listed species are present and could be adversely affected by
the proposed activity. The review process for the issuance of individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide
permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit
applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require avoidance or mitigation of environmental
impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an applicant to seek an individual
permit if the Corps believes that the resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In
practice, the Corps rarely requires an individual permit when a project would qualify for a nationwide permit, except
when a threatened or endangered species or other significant resource would be adversely affected by the proposed
activity.

s competitive exclusion by shrubs and trees as a result of succession in bogs and coastal prairie/scrub. Human activities
such as draining of wetlands, clearing of land, elimination of beaver, and stabilization of moving sand areas have
interrupted the natural processes of bog and wetland creation. As late-stage bogs and coastal scrub go through succession
to forest, lily habitat is eliminated with little new habitat being created. There is some indication that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
populations have been maintained in the past by periodic fires, perhaps set by native Americans (Schultz 1989). Charcoal
is abundant in the soil at several of the major populations, indicating past fires. Fires are now rare events in these
areas.

Young plants of this species are almost always recruited under shrub cover, but the lily is shaded out if the canopy
cover is greater than 50 percent or shrubs are over 2 meters (6 ft) high. Several populations and portions of populations
have already been extirpated by forest succession. Eleven populations (ranging from 2 to about 1,000 plants) currently
are seriously stressed from competition, as indicated by low reproductive rates (Schultz 1989). Individual plants
do not flower every year, apparently as an energy-saving mechanism when stressed. Health of a population can be evaluated
by the number of flowering versus non-flowering plants, and the number of blooms per plant. It has been suggested that
the 11 stressed populations would probably survive less than a decade without habitat manipulation (Schultz 1989).

has eliminated suitable habitat in Oregon near Blacklock Point (Ballantyne 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At four California ranch populations, livestock exclosure fences have solved the immediate problem of overgrazing
(Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1992). A limited amount of grazing may actually benefit the species by preventing succession.
Over time, without habitat management, forest succession within the exclosures would limit the lilies to the well-lighted
edges of the exclosures and reproduction would deteriorate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some populations are so small (2 to 100 flowering plants) that loss of genetic variability is a threat. Plants with
genetic abnormalities such as 4-merous flowers, tepals replacing stamens, stamens replacing tepals, and double
flowers have been observed over two or more seasons at sites in both California and Oregon. The effects of inbreeding
may already be adversely affecting the viability of these small populations and remains a future threat to the plant
(Schultz 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
as endangered. This species occupies an extremely restricted geographic range and is comprised of a total of 2,000
to 3,000 flowering individuals. Residential development, conversion of habitat to cranberry farms, shrub and tree
succession, overcollection, vandalism, overgrazing, and loss of genetic diversity threaten this plant with extinction.
Because the plant is in danger of extinction throughout its range, it fits the definition of endangered under the Act.

Critical habitat is not being designated for this species for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the species is listed. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat
is not presently prudent for this species. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as required for the designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take
or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline and increase enforcement problems. The listing of this
species under the Act publicizes the rarity of the species and, thus, could make this plant attractive to researchers,
curiosity seekers, or collectors of wildflowers or rare plants. All involved parties and landowners have been notified
of the importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of the species' habitat will be addressed through
the recovery process and the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical
habitat for this species is not prudent at this time because such designation would increase the degree of threat from
collecting or other human activities.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies,
private organizations, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and
cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection
required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed,
in part, below.

Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation
provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure
that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed
species. If a Federal action may affect a listed species, the responsible Federal agency must enter into consultation
with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will become involved with this plant species after listing through its permitting
authority as described under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. By regulation, permits may not be issued where a federally
listed endangered or threatened species would be affected by the proposed project without first completing consultation
pursuant to section 7 of the Act. The presence of a listed species would highlight the national importance of these
resources. In addition, insurance of housing loans by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in areas that
presently support 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lilium occidentale 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
will be subject to review by the Service under section 7 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61 and 17.62, set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to listed plant species. All prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply.
These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import
or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale
this species in interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession the species from areas under
Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for plants listed as endangered, the Act prohibits the malicious damage or destruction
of any such species on lands under Federal jurisdiction; or removal, cutting, digging up, damaging, or destroying
of such plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, or in the course of any violation of a State criminal
trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR
17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered
plants under certain circumstances. Such permits are available for scientific purposes and to enhance propagation
or survival of the species. It is anticipated that trade permits might be sought because the species is in cultivation
and is very rare in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations regarding listed species and inquiries about prohibitions
and permits may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that the 1994 General category quota, minus a 65 metric tons (mt) set aside for a late season fishery
beginning September 15th, will be taken by August 14, 1994. Therefore, the General category fishery will be closed
effective at 0001 hours on Monday, August 15, 1994. This action is being taken to prevent overharvest of the quota established
for this fishery while providing an opportunity for areas that have not yet had an ample opportunity to harvest a fair
share of the quota beginning September 15, 1994.

.) governing the harvest of Atlantic bluefin tuna by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction are found at
50 CFR part 285. Section 285.22 subdivides the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas recommended
U.S. quota among the various domestic fishing categories.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementing regulations for the Atlantic Tuna Fisheries at 50 CFR 285.22(a) provide for an annual quota of 531 mt
of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna to be harvested from the Regulatory Area by vessels permitted in the
General category. Of this amount, 65 mt are set aside for a late season fishery beginning September 15. The Assistant
Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, is required under &sect;285.20(b)(1) to monitor the catch and landing statistics
and, on the basis of these statistics, to project a date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will equal the annual
quota minus 65 mt, and to publish a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document stating that fishing for, retaining, possessing, or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the early-season
quota must cease on that date at a specified hour, and not recommence until September 15th, whereupon a quota equal
to the difference between the annual quota and the estimated catch prior to September 15th will become available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General category has taken approximately 364 mt of its 531 mt quota as of August 10, 1994. While NMFS had calculated
an average catch in August of 12 mt per day, industry contacts have informed NMFS that catch per day has increased to
17 mt per day or more. Atlantic bluefin tuna are still abundant off of Maine and Massachusetts, the primary commercial
fishing grounds, and have not migrated offshore and further south. Effort by General category vessels remains high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the landing reports, it is projected that the quota of Atlantic bluefin tuna allocated for the General category,
minus a 65 mt set aside amount for the late season fishery will be reached by August 14, 1994. Fishing for, retention
of, possessing, or landing large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna by vessels in the General category must cease
by 0001 hours August 15, 1994. The intent of this action is to prevent overharvest of the quota established for this
fishery while helping continue traditional late summer and early fall fisheries and providing a fishing opportunity
in areas that have not yet had an ample opportunity to harvest a fair share of the quota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning September 15, 1994, in areas to be described and under conditions to be specified in a future document to
be filed with the Office of the Federal Register, vessels permitted in the General category may resume fishing for
Atlantic bluefin tuna at a catch rate of one large medium or giant bluefin tuna per day per vessel, until the set aside
allocation has been taken.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The New England Fishery Management Council (Council) submitted Amendment 5 to the FMP on September 27, 1993. Two measures
of the amendment were disapproved on September 30, 1993_one measure pertaining to a haddock possession limit, and
the other pertaining to winter flounder fishing in state waters. The remainder of Amendment 5 was approved on January
3, 1994. The final rule for Amendment 5 was published on March 1, 1994 (59 FR 9872). This action makes several corrections
and clarifications to that rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 5 requires vessels in the Fleet days-at-sea (DAS) program, for multispecies trips longer than 24 hours,
to tie-up (layover) at the dock at the end of each trip for half the amount of DAS accrued on the trip. Since many vessels,
when in harbor, tie-up at a mooring instead of a dock and/or move between locations in the harbor to attend to operational
needs such as refueling, a definition for ``tied-up to the dock'' has been added to &sect;651.2 to clarify that a vessel
may be tied to either a mooring or a dock and may move between locations in the same harbor during its layover period.
This definition complies with the objectives of the FMP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From March 1 through July 31, vessels in the Stellwagen Bank/Jeffreys Ledge (SB/JL) juvenile protection area are
required by &sect;651.20(a)(5) to have 6-inch (15.24-cm) square mesh in the last 140 bars of the codend and extension
piece of all mobile net gear. The final regulation inadvertently did not define square mesh. To clarify the square-mesh
requirement, a definition of ``square mesh'' has been added to &sect;651.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule for Amendment 5 set forth how diamond mesh would be measured for enforcement purposes but inadvertently
omitted the measurement technique for square mesh. Language is added to &sect;651.20(g) to set forth the measurement
technique for square mesh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations implementing Amendment 5 allow vessels fishing for non-regulated species, in the regulated mesh
areas, to obtain an exemption permit to fish with midwater trawl or purse seine gear. Although the FMP only requires
such a permit in those areas that do not allow the stowage of small-mesh nets, the regulations are not clear and seem
to require that such a permit be obtained for all areas. Sections 651.20(e) and 651.20(f) are revised to remove that
ambiguity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the regulations as now written, a vessel, while its DAS are being appealed, may fish under the Fleet DAS
program until a determination is made on the appeal. The regulations are not explicit, however, on whether a vessel
that has received an initial allocation of individual DAS may fish pursuant to that initial allocation during an appeal
of the amount of DAS allocated. In such a case, the vessel has received, independent of the appeal, authorization to
fish under the individual DAS program. The fact that the vessel may be appealing the amount of DAS allocated does not
preclude the vessel from fishing the individual DAS that are not in dispute. The regulations as originally written
were intended only to define the rights of vessels that otherwise would not have any significant allocation of DAS
while an appeal was pending. To clarify the intent, &sect;651.22(b)(7) is revised to specify that vessels may elect
to fish under the individual DAS program, while under appeal, if they have been initially allocated individual DAS,
provided they do not exceed their initial allocation of DAS and remain in the individual DAS program for the remainder
of the 1994&hyph;95 fishing season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the October 27, 1993, proposed rule for Amendment 5 (58 FR 57774), dealer, operator and vessel permits were to expire
upon the date specified in the permit. This was done to eliminate unnecessary renewal burdens to permit holders and
to give the Regional Director the flexibility to deal efficiently with the administrative burden associated with
permit renewals. The final regulatory language inadvertently specified that permits must be renewed annually.
This was not the intent. Accordingly, changes are made to &sect;651.4(i), &sect;651.5(g), and &sect;651.6(f) to
remove the annual renewal requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A prohibition concerning the reporting requirements in &sect;651.7(b)(1) was inadvertently omitted and is added
at &sect;651.9(a)(14). This prohibition requires federally permitted multispecies vessel operators to sell,
barter, or trade multispecies finfish only to federally permitted multispecies dealers. This prohibition mirrors
a prohibition at &sect;651.9(e)(7) that prohibits federally permitted dealers from purchasing, possessing, or
receiving multispecies from a vessel that does not hold a Federal multispecies permit, with the exception of vessels
that fish exclusively in state waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulation implementing Framework Adjustment 4 to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FMP (59 FR 26972) implemented a series of time and area closures for the sink gillnet fishery. Since these regulations
prohibit sink gillnet operators from possessing gillnet gear aboard their vessel while in the areas and for the times
specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;651.32(a), vessels would be prevented from transiting a closed area while in possession of gillnet gear. Based
on a review of the record, it is clear that the Council did not intend that gillnet vessels be precluded from accessing
open areas. This action clarifies the Council's intent by adding language that will allow for net stowage pursuant
to &sect;651.20(c)(4) so that a gillnet vessel may transit a closed area. The Regional Director, pursuant to &sect;651.20(c)(4)(iv)
may specify by letter to permit holders additional methods for lawfully storing gillnet gear while transiting a closed
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Currently, &sect;651.30 prohibits the transfer at sea of multispecies finfish. A review of the record revealed that
this prohibition should have been limited to the transfer of regulated species. Section 651.30(a) and &sect;651.30(b)
have been revised to correct this error, as have the corresponding prohibitions in &sect;651.9(a)(7) and &sect;651.9(e)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this action accomplishes three other corrections: The metric conversion for winter flounder in &sect;651.23(a)
is corrected; in &sect;651.22(c)(1)(i)(B), ``multispecies'' is replaced by ``regulated species;'' and clearer,
more detailed versions of figures 1 and 3 are provided.

Because this rule only corrects omissions and other errors or makes clarifications of intent to an existing set of
regulations for which full prior notice and opportunity for comment have been given, no useful purpose would be served
by providing prior notice and opportunity for comment for this rule. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) it is unnecessary
to provide such notice and opportunity for comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All but one provision of this rule impose no new requirements on anyone subject to these regulations and many provisions
remove or relieve restrictions. Accordingly, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d), they may be made immediately effective. Section
651.9(a)(14) adds a new prohibition which is effective 30 days from the date of filing with the Office of the Federal
Register.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements changes to Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) procedures that relate
to carrying firearms, expanding the arrest and service of process authority of immigration officers beyond matters
involving violations of the immigration laws, and requiring that every alien fourteen years of age or older, against
whom deportation proceedings are commenced, shall be fingerprinted and photographed and that such fingerprints
and photographs shall be made available to other law enforcement agencies upon request. This rule also codifies existing
policy guidelines regarding the authority of immigration officers under the direction and control of the Attorney
General to arrest persons, carry firearms, serve process, and perform other related enforcement functions. The
final rule affairs both existing and newly-developed policies and ensures the consistent application of these policies
by all immigration officers involved in the enforcement of the immigration laws.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 14, 1992, at 57 FR 47011&hyph;47020, the Attorney General published a proposed rule to implement section
503 of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law No. 101&hyph;649 (8 U.S.C. 1357), and requested comments from
interested parties by November 30, 1992. Section 503(a) of IMMACT amended section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality
Act (Act). Section 503(a) authorizes immigration officers, when performing duties relating to the enforcement
of the immigration laws and when authorized under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, to arrest without
a warrant any person likely to flee before a warrant can be obtained, for any offense against the United States committed
in the officer's presence or for any felony cognizable under the laws of the United States if the officer has reasonable
grounds to believe the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such a felony. Section 503(a) of IMMACT
also authorizes immigration officers, under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General, to carry firearms
and to execute and serve any orders, warrants, subpoenas, summonses, or other process issued under the authority
of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503(b) of IMMACT requires fingerprinting and photographing of any alien fourteen years of age or older against
whom deportation proceedings have been commenced under section 242 of the Act, and dictates that such fingerprints
be made available to law enforcement agencies upon request. Finally, section 503(a) of IMMACT requires, as a condition
of immigration officers' authority to make warrantless arrests under amended section 287(a)(5)(B) for felonies,
the Attorney General to publish final regulations that define the categories of immigration officers who may use
force, including deadly force, and the circumstances under which such force may be used; establish standards with
respect to enforcement activities of the Service; require that no immigration officer be authorized to make arrests
under section 287(a)(5)(B) of the Act unless that officer has been certified as having completed a training program
covering such arrests and standards and establish an expedited internal review process for violations of such standards.

The proposed rule set forth regulations implementing these provisions of section 503 of IMMACT. A total of 235 comments
were received, reviewed, and considered in writing this final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters stated that the proposed rule failed to comply with section 4(b) of E.O. 12291 as it relates to the comments
of persons directly affected by the rule, and sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778 as they relate to adherence to
certain requirements in promulgating new regulations and reviewing existing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the provisions of E.O. 12291 pertain only to major rules. In the proposed rule, the Attorney General stated
that this rule is not a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291. Therefore, section 4(b) of that Executive
Order is inapplicable. With regard to E.O. 12778, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a Memorandum for
Agency Regulatory Contacts dated January 9, 1992, stating that there are two ways that an agency may certify compliance
to OMB as part of the regulatory review process. An agency may attach a certification of compliance with E.O. 12778
to Standard Form 83 signed by an attorney, or an agency may insert a statement of such certification in the preamble
to the draft rule itself. The Department of Justice (Department), following review of the rule in light of E.O. 12778
and in compliance with that Executive Order, attached a certification of compliance. Accordingly, the Department
and the Service believe that the requirements of E.O. 12291 (which was superseded by E.O. 12866 on September 30, 1993),
12866, and 12778 have been met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the proposed rule may be in violation of the Service's contract with its collective bargaining
unit because the required negotiations have not occurred regarding those aspects of the rule that constitute substantive
changes in conditions of employment affecting the bargaining unit. During development of the final rule, negotiations
occurred with both the National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council and the National Border Patrol Council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserted that the existing Service Firearms Policy could not be changed because it constituted an agreement
with the employee unions. The Service disagrees because there is no agreement between it and the employee unions regarding
the existing Service Firearms Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter pointed out that the proposed rule failed to indicate whether the regulations would preempt state or
local laws regarding peace officer status. The regulations implement new statutory authorities pertaining to arrests
and service of process for federal matters and would not affect current practices with states. State law may provide
immigration officers with peace officer status that would also provide the authority to make arrests for state law
violations. However, unless specifically authorized as a peace officer under state law, an immigration officer's
authority to enforce the state statute is that of an ordinary citizen. The limitations and liabilities associated
with such action are defined in state law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the proposed regulations appeared to conflict with sections 101(a)(18) and 235 of the Act
as they relate to the definition of ``immigration officer'' and an immigration officer's authority to administer
oaths, take and consider evidence, and require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and production
of documents. The Service disagrees. Section 101(a)(18) of the Act authorizes the Attorney General to designate,
individually or by regulation, any employee or class of employees to perform the functions of an immigration officer
specified by the Act or any section thereof. In the proposed regulations, the Attorney General accomplished this
by designating those categories of immigration officers authorized to perform the functions of sections 242 and
287 of the Act. The commenter stated incorrectly that &sect;287.5(a) of the proposed rule required certain immigration
officers to obtain individual or class designation in order to be authorized to interrogate and administer oaths.
The proposed rule in &sect;287.5(a) allowed any immigration officer as defined in 8 CFR 103.1(q) to interrogate and
administer oaths. With regard to subpoenas, the proposed rule made no changes to the current regulations in &sect;287.4
pertaining to the subpoena process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters criticized the proposed rule for not providing a sufficient statement of the legislative history
of section 503 of IMMACT in the Summary section. An adequate description of the requirements of section 503 was provided
by the notice of proposed rulemaking in the Supplementary Information section of the rule in accordance with the Federal
Register's document drafting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter recommended that the effective date of the final rule for other than permanent full-time (OTP) immigration
inspectors be extended to two years from date of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is order to have sufficient time to provide both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new
enforcement standards. Such an extension is impracticable as many permanent full-time immigration officers will
also need to receive both basic immigration law enforcement training and training in the new enforcement standards.
It would be inappropriate to allow the OTP immigration officers to take more time in meeting the training timetable
than the permanent full-time employees because this would result in having OTP immigration inspectors operating
under the old regulations while working side by side with permanent full-time immigration inspectors recently trained
in, and operating under, the new regulations. This situation would not only promote procedural inconsistencies
and confusion, but also subject the public to two different regulatory standards at ports of entry. The Attorney General
has delayed implementation of the final rule to one year from date of publication in order to ensure training of approximately
10,000 immigration officers in the new enforcement authorities and standards. The Attorney General recognizes
the difficulties inherent in meeting this rigorous training schedule. However, she is committed to ensuring a consistent
and unified implementation approach nationwide that only one delayed implementation date can provide.

Sections 242.2 and 287.7_Apprehension, Custody, and Detention and Retainer Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the proposed rule was contradictory by requiring that an immigration officer successfully
complete basic immigration law enforcement training in order to be authorized to issue a detainer in &sect;&sect;242.2(a)
and 287.7(a), yet not requiring the successful completion of basic immigration law enforcement training in order
to be authorized to issue an order to show cause in &sect;242.1(a) or a warrant of arrest in &sect;242.2(c). A detainer
is the mechanism by which the Service requests that the detaining agency notify the Service of the date, time, or place
of release of an alien who has been arrested or convicted under federal, state, or local law. The Service agrees with
the commenter that the standards for issuance of a detainer are no greater than those for issuance of an order to show
cause and a warrant of arrest for immigration violations. The final rule deletes the requirement of successful completion
of basic immigration law enforcement training for authorization to issue detainers. Training in immigration law
and procedure is necessary to issue detainers, but training as a law enforcement officer is not needed to effectively
conduct this portion of the immigration process. This does not eliminate the immigration officer's responsibility
to ensure that detainers are issued only to aliens who are amenable to exclusion or deportation proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters stated that the authority to issue a warrant of arrest in &sect;242.2(c) should include the authority
to serve the warrant of arrest in &sect;287.5(e)(2). The Service disagrees. Issuance of a warrant of arrest entails
signature by an authorized immigration officer, while service of the warrant entails a step-by-step process requiring
training and proficiency in service of process procedures. The two authorities are separate and distinct processes.

Section 287.1_Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged the inclusion of the Other Than Permanent Full-Time (OTP) Immigration Inspector Basic Training
Course in the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in &sect;287.1(g). The Service agrees
and this section has been amended accordingly. However, an OTP immigration inspector will not be authorized to make
arrests for federal offenses under section 287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act until such time as he or she converts status
to permanent full-time and successfully completes training applicable to that position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters urged the Service to expand the definition of ``basic immigration law enforcement training'' in
&sect;287.1(g) to include prior law enforcement experience or training with other federal, state, or local agencies
as well as lengthy Service experience or other miscellaneous Service training courses apart from the basic training
courses. The Service acknowledges that successful completion of one or more training courses presented by the Federal
Government or a state-certified program may be substantially equivalent to basic immigration law enforcement training.
The final rule provides a mechanism for considering other training by expanding the definition of ``basic immigration
law enforcement training'' to include training that is substantially equivalent thereto as determined by the Commissioner
with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. The Commissioner's review is necessary to ensure that each immigration
officer has all the required federal and, in particular, immigration law enforcement training. For example, an immigration
officer who was employed previously in another Federal agency as a special agent, and thus had training in general
Federal laws, would still need immigration law enforcement training.

Sections 287.5 and 287.9_Exercise of Power by Immigration Officers and Criminal Search Warrant and Firearms Policies
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ninety-eight commenters expressed concern that the proposed regulations precluded immigration officers from
carrying firearms in &sect;&sect;287.5(f) and 287.9(b), effecting arrests for immigration violations in &sect;&sect;287.5(c)
(1), (2), and (5), and serving process in &sect;287.5(e) while off duty. The commenters stated that it is not uncommon
for immigration officers or other federal law enforcement officers in an off-duty status to receive telephone calls
at home from other federal, state, or local law enforcement officers requesting their immediate assistance. The
commenters pointed out that only &sect;&sect;287(a)(5) (A) and (B) of the Act, regarding arrest authority for federal
offenses, stipulate that an immigration officer must be ``performing duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration
laws at the time of the arrest'' and that this language should not be included in those sections of the proposed rule
regarding the other enforcement authorities. In drafting the proposed rule, the Service did not intend to impair
an immigration officer's ability to place himself or herself on duty when necessary for the purpose of enforcing the
immigration laws of the United States. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has removed the language ``performing
duties relating to the enforcement of the immigration laws at the time of the arrest'' from the enforcement authorities
except where required by statute. The Service has also removed the language ``In an on duty status'' from &sect;287.9(b).
Administrative guidelines will be developed to explain when an immigration officer on his or her own initiative may
place himself or herself in an on-duty status.

Fifty-two commenters objected to establishing a separate process for Service managers, including district directors,
deputy district directors, officers in charge, and assistant officers in charge, to request the Commissioner's
authorization to exercise each of the enforcement authorities. The commenters stated that this process would hold
managers to a higher standard than their subordinates, many of whom are trainees still on probation, who are automatically
empowered to exercise an authority if they have completed the requisite training. The commenters asserted that this
process violates standard management hierarchy, and pointed out that the vast majority of affected individuals
are career immigration officers who not only have completed basic immigration law enforcement training, but also
have extensive experience in field enforcement operations. In fact, due to the Service's limited enforcement resources,
these managers participate frequently in Service field enforcement operations or respond to requests for assistance
from other law enforcement agencies when their subordinates are out of the office conducting field operations. The
commenters asserted that managers in other agencies within the Department, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
are vested with the same powers and authorities as their subordinates, and the Service's managers should not be treated
differently if they have undergone the requisite training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and the Department agree that a more streamlined process should be established for granting enforcement
authorities to Service managers who are trained and who have maintained qualifications. The rationale behind the
proposed rule's segregation of managers was to ensure that law enforcement authorities are granted only to those
immigration officers, regardless of rank, who need the authorities and are fully trained in how to exercise them.
To accomplish this task more expediently while ensuring the existence of a well-trained cadre of immigration officers
at all levels in the agency, the final rule provides enforcement authorities to managers who have successfully completed
basic immigration law enforcement training without creating a separate authorization process. The final rule also
provides a mechanism for empowering those managers, as well as other immigration officers within one of the designated
categories, who have not successfully completed one of the basic immigration law enforcement training courses by
allowing them either to attend one of the basic immigration law enforcement training courses or to seek a determination
from the Commissioner, with the Deputy Attorney General's approval, that they have training substantially equivalent
thereto.

A number of commenters stated that each immigration officer should have the power to exercise all of the enforcement
authorities as long as each such officer is trained and certified. They stated that the proposed regulations created
a rigid class system wherein only certain categories of immigration officers would be authorized to exercise certain
enforcement functions and that this system impedes the Service's ability to respond to operational emergencies.
In addition, some commenters stated that the enforcement role of immigration inspectors at ports of entry and the
field review work and office interviews conducted by immigration examiners necessitate empowering both inspectors
and examiners with all of the enforcement authorities. The Service and the Department disagree. In drafting the proposed
rule, the Service used the Attorney General's ``Guidelines for Legislation Involving Federal Criminal Law Enforcement
Authority'' (Guidelines) dated June 29, 1984. Although the Guidelines were developed to guide federal agencies
in preparing legislative proposals concerning future grants of law enforcement authority, the Guidelines' overriding
policy is that an officer should be given only the authorities that the officer needs and has been trained to execute.
The Guidelines require an agency to extend grants of law enforcement authority only to those employees who have graduated
from an accredited course of training in the exercise of that authority and only where a significant likelihood exists
that, in the course of performing their assigned duties, the employees will frequently encounter situations in which
it is necessary to exercise that authority. Each category of immigration officers has a different mission, and only
those categories who satisfied the Attorney General's criteria were granted one or more of the enforcement authorities.
In reviewing these regulations, consistent with the Department's review of other regulations, guidelines, and
policies affecting criminal law enforcement authority in the Executive Branch, the Department believes that the
same delineation of authorities is both appropriate and effective. The following chart summarizes the categories
of immigration officers who are authorized to exercise the principal enforcement authorities.

Some commenters stated that immigration inspectors at ports of entry need the authority to execute arrest warrants
for immigration violations to conform with historical practices of the United States Attorneys offices. In light
of existing practices, the Service and the Department agree that immigration inspectors at ports of entry do need
to continue executing arrest warrants for both criminal and administrative immigration violations. However, immigration
inspectors do not need the authority to execute arrest warrants for non-immigration criminal violations. The investigation
of non-immigration criminal offenses associated with the authority to execute an arrest warrant for non-immigration
violations is beyond the scope of an immigration inspector's responsibilities. Accordingly, the structure of &sect;287.5(e)
in the final rule has been changed to focus on the distinction between ``immigration'' and ``non-immigration'' offenses,
and to grant authority to immigration inspectors to execute arrest warrants for immigration violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised language of &sect;287.5(e) also specifies, as the structure of the proposed rule specified, that detention
enforcement officers are authorized only to execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations,
not warrants for a criminal arrest that can be executed by other officers. In carrying forward this distinction, the
Commissioner is authorized to designate additional officers (individually or as a class) to execute warrants of
arrest for administrative immigration violations, while approval of the Deputy Attorney General must be sought
to designate additional officers (individually or as a class) to execute criminal arrest warrants. Finally, &sect;287.5(e)(2)(ii)
grants authority to execute criminal warrants of arrest for non-immigration violations only to border patrol agents,
special agents, deportation officers, their supervisors and managers, and immigration officers who need such authority
and who have been designated by the Commissioner with the approval of the Deputy Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters questioned the efficacy of granting immigration examiners the power to arrest for immigration
violations in &sect;&sect;287.5(c) (1) and (2) yet not authorizing them to carry firearms in &sect;287.5(f). Similarly,
other commenters stated it was inappropriate to authorize detention enforcement officers to carry firearms yet
preclude them from effecting any arrests. The Service and the Department disagree. The ability to effect an arrest
is not conditioned upon the carrying of a firearm. Other federal, state, and local law enforcement officers' duties
require them to make arrests without a firearm, and they do so without incident. Similarly, the potential need and
ability to use deadly force to defend an officer does not imply a concomitant need for arrest authority. The two authorities
are not necessarily concomitant. Detention enforcement officers do not need arrest authority. Detention enforcement
officers' principal duties are to transport and guard detained individuals who have already been placed under arrest.
They also execute warrants of arrest for administrative immigration violations. In order to clarify the detention
enforcement officers' authorities, &sect;287.59(c)(6) has been added to the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters questioned whether immigration examiners and deportation officers who perform inspectional duties
at ports of entry on an overtime basis would be precluded from exercising the enforcement authorities granted to immigration
inspectors. Immigration examiners, including free trade examiners, and deportation officers are considered to
be immigration inspectors when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising
other immigration inspectors performing inspections, provided all training requirements for immigration inspectors
have been met. To avoid misinterpretation, the Service has added language to the rule stipulating that immigration
examiners are authorized to exercise the same enforcement authorities granted to immigration inspectors when they
are in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising other immigration inspectors
performing inspections. Deportation officers are already listed as authorized to exercise the same enforcement
authorities granted to immigration inspectors, but &sect;287.5(b) has been amended for clarification to include
deportation officers only when in the uniform of an immigration inspector and performing inspections or supervising
other immigration inspectors performing inspections.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters stated that certain immigration officers stationed in Service offices overseas should be granted
law enforcement authority. They also noted that immigration officers stationed overseas occasionally must work
on cases within the United States. The Service and the Department note, however, that immigration officers cannot
exercise any of the enforcement authorities while working in foreign countries. When overseas officers are assigned
to a duty post within the United States, they assume the power to exercise all of the criminal and civil enforcement
authorities assigned to the applicable category of immigration officers, provided all training requirements have
been met. For example, a special agent overseas who is detailed to an assignment in the United States has all of the enforcement
authorities granted to special agents, provided that the detailed special agent has met all training requirements
for special agents. However, overseas immigration officers do need the authority to interrogate, administer oaths,
and take and consider evidence. Accordingly, &sect;287.5(a) in the final rule has been amended to grant such officers
authority to interrogate, administer oaths, and take and consider evidence in or outside the United States.

One commenter stated that the proposed rule in &sect;287.8(c)(2) should be changed to remove the requirement that
the immigration officer must document, on appropriate Service forms, the fact that an arrestee was advised of his
or her rights. The commenter pointed out that many United States Attorneys accept advice of rights given in the presence
of witnesses in lieu of a form. The Service disagrees. Immigration officers must document advice of rights on appropriate
Service forms, consistent with the practice of other components within the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that proposed &sect;287.8(c)(2) incorrectly stated that a person arrested and charged
with a criminal violation shall be advised of the appropriate rights as required by law at the time of arrest, or as soon
thereafter as practicable. The commenter pointed out that current law requires that such warnings be provided only
prior to a custodial interrogation. The commenter further stated that many criminal arrests are made where the arresting
officer does not want to conduct a custodial interrogation and therefore should not be required to advise the person
arrested of the appropriate rights. The Service and the Department disagree with the commenter's interpretation
of the rule. First, the rule states that the person arrested shall be advised of the appropriate rights as required
by law. The law, including constitutional standards, determines when advice of rights must be provided. Second,
to the extent that the rule encourages a uniform advice of rights at or shortly after the point of arrest, it serves as
an appropriate reminder of these constitutional standards and establishes a practice that will prevent situations

One commenter stated that the definition of a designated pursuit vehicle in &sect;287.8(e)(1) should stipulate
that the vehicle must be a sedan in order to conform to the Border Patrol Vehicle Pursuit Policy. The Service disagrees.
Other enforcement programs will be developing their own vehicle pursuit policies that may permit the use if vehicles
other than sedans. The proposed regulations authorized certain categories of immigration officers, including
special agents and deportation officers, to initiate a vehicular pursuit. In the final rule, special agents and deportation
officers have been removed from the list until such time as the Investigations and the Detention and Deportation Programs
have developed their specific vehicle pursuit policy, the policy is approved by the Commissioner, and all of the special
agents and/or deportation officers authorized to initiate vehicular pursuits have undergone the requisite pursuit
driving training and received training in the new policy.

Section 287.10_Expedited Internal Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questioned the legitimacy of the Service's Office of Internal Audit, starting that the Service is trying
to create by regulation an office similar in function to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which was transferred
from the Service to the Office of the Inspector General of the Department pursuant to section 102(d) of the Inspector
General Act Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;504. The Service and the Department disagree. The Office of Internal
Audit was established in the reorganization of the Service and approved by the Attorney General in April 1991. Regulations
have been drafted wherein the Director of Internal Audit is responsible, in part, for providing the capability to
investigate alleged misconduct by Service employees and for coordinating that program with other agencies within
the Department. The transfer of the Office of Professional Responsibility from the Service to the Office of the Inspector
General neither relieved Service management from responsibility for ensuring proper employee conduct nor precluded
Service management from exercising its fundamental management authorities to identify and correct employee misconduct.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the proposed rule in &sect;287.10 was insufficiently specific because it stated only that
allegations of misconduct would be referred ``promptly'' and did not: describe how the process for resolution would
be expedited; describe the circumstances under which a Service employee, against whom allegations were made, might
not be notified of the allegations; indicate that more serious allegations would be handled differently than less
serious ones; call for the involvement of operational peers or supervisors in resolving allegations; and eliminate
from involvement in the process management officials who lack law enforcement experience. It is not appropriate
to incorporate the specific requirements for the handling of alleged violations of the enforcement standards into
administrative rulemaking, and therefore, no change has been made to the final rule.

Legal Sufficiency
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sixty-nine advocacy organizations and individuals filed substantially similar or identical comments stating
that the regulations are legally insufficient to meet the legislative mandate set forth by Congress. These comments
are generally summarized below and followed by specific comments and responses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters stated that the regulations are legally insufficient because they fail to comply with the congressional
mandates: (1) to define the enforcement authority; (2) to elaborate on the scope and limits of such authority and to
formulate written policies, directives, rules, and regulations to ensure the exercise of that authority within
those limits; (3) to provide training for officers in how to exercise the discretionary authority granted; and (4)
to outline a formal procedure for agency accountability to the community when the authority has been exercised. The
commenters stated that the regulations are insufficiently specific and detailed on each of these subjects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Service agrees with many of the suggestions regarding appropriate law enforcement standards as consistent
with Department policy applicable to all law enforcement agencies, the Service disagrees that these regulations
are either the appropriate vehicle to specify the detail of such standards, or that Congress mandated such a degree
of specificity. The commenters effectively requested that the Service and the Department provide specific guidelines
for discretionary decisions under other legal constraints and sound judgment, detailed procedures of daily operation,
and substantive training materials, timetables, and protocols that are encompassed in enforcement manuals, supervisory
review procedures, and training curricula. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, the Service will not provide
this information and guidance in regulatory form; the Department declines to make an exception to standing policies
for the management of the criminal justice system in the Executive Branch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestions made by these comments are appropriately directed to the functions of training and management, not
administrative rulemaking. The Service and the Department agree with many of these suggestions, and, as noted below,
have either incorporated them into existing training and management guidelines or are in the process of doing so.
A section-by-section discussion of these comments follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 287.1(g)_Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters criticized &sect;287.1(g) for not providing sufficient detail regarding the substance of the training
that must be completed by Service officers prior to assuming the new enforcement authority provided by section 503
of IMMACT. The commenters noted that neither the course subjects, length, nor materials are specified, and stated
that the regulations should at the very least indicate how the curriculum of existing Service training programs will
be amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also alleged that ``nothing new'' is added by these regulations because all Service officers have
already completed one course of basic immigration law training. The commenters suggested that the regulations should
require that Service officers attend additional training before assuming additional enforcement authority. Finally,
the commenters suggested that the regulations should require periodic attendance by Service officers at national
or local training events devoted to new legal standards, case decisions, and Service interpretations of the law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Service notes that these commenters appear to have assumed that Service officers who have previously
completed a course of basic immigration law enforcement training will not be required to undergo additional training
before being authorized to undertake the enhanced enforcement authority prescribed in section 503. However, &sect;287.5(c)(4)(iii)
of the proposed rule specifically stated that no immigration officer could assume enhanced arrest authority until
the Director of Training had certified that the immigration officer had completed a training course encompassing
such arrests and the standards for enforcement activities specified in &sect;287.8 of the regulations. Virtually
all affected officers will receive additional training during the planned one-year interval between the publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of this final rule and its effective date. This training is currently being developed in conjunction with other components
of the Department to ensure that the training is consistent with existing training on the execution of law enforcement
authorities and the investigative and prosecutorial policies of the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service agrees that existing training courses in basic law enforcement should be amended to include the training
required by section 503; these curricula are in the process of being revised. Furthermore, the Service agrees that
officers should receive training throughout their careers regarding new statutes, legal precedent, and policies
for enforcement. Service guidelines and training programs will be continually updated to meet these needs. Precisely
because judicial precedent and the Department's investigative and prosecutorial policies are constantly evolving,
the Department concludes that it is not appropriate to further specify in regulations the curricula or frequency
of training programs. Moreover, daily supervision to ensure compliance with legal standards enunciated by Congress
and the courts is generally more effective and efficient than developing detailed statements in the form of regulations
that cannot provide guidance in all situations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters suggested that the concept of a ``show of authority'' to restrain the freedom of an individual to walk
away under &sect;287.8(b)(1) be expanded to specifically include verbal or psychological abuse. The term ``show
of authority'' in the proposed rule was intended to emphasize the intimidating gestures are prohibited during pre-detention
questioning. However, the Service has decided to eliminate the term ``show of authority'' as well as the language
``by means of physical force'' in the final rule, thereby clarifying that any action taken by an immigration officer
during pre-detention questioning must not lead the person being questioned to believe that he or she is not free to
leave the presence of the officer. The Service's training program will ensure that all immigration officers have
a thorough understanding of proper procedures for conducting pre-detention questioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also suggested that &sect;287.8(b)(2) be substantially amended to include current judicial precedent
defining ``reasonable suspicion'' and the general authority to interrogate and detain. Binding judicial precedent

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters generally stated that the provisions in &sect;&sect;287.5(c) and 287.8(c) do not incorporate the
``standard with respect to enforcement'' mandated by section 503 of IMMACT. The commenters suggested that the regulations
be amended to incorporate the judicial construction of ``reason to believe,'' and to require compliance with outstanding
court orders regarding arrest and post-arrest procedures. As stated previously, judicial precedent and other policy
standards are subject to revision and are not appropriate to codify. The Service is clearly bound by such interpretations,
including those set forth in

to that effect is unnecessary. The commenters also suggested that the specific provisions of a temporary settlement

case has required the Service to promulgate regulations on this subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter criticized these sections for permitting individuals who have not fulfilled the statutory training
requirement for enhanced arrest authority to be designated as service officers with arrest authority. However,
all officers who are designated to have such authority must receive the appropriate training pursuant to &sect;&sect;287.5(c)(4)
(iii)&hyph;(iv). The commenter also stated that &sect;287.5(c)(5), in specifying the authority for arrests under
section 274 of the Act, failed to distinguish adequately between arrests with and without a warrant. However, this
section of the rule incorporates the enforcement standard regarding arrests set forth in &sect;287.8(c), which
includes a rule requiring officers whenever possible to obtain a warrant prior to arrest. In criminal cases, pursuant
to &sect;287.5(c) (2) and (3), the issuance of such a warrant is reviewed by an Assistant United States Attorney and
a Magistrate Judge before an arrest is effected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters stated that &sect;242.2(c)(1) should be amended to provide that an arrest warrant must be obtained
unless there is a likelihood of the alien escaping before a warrant can be obtained. This suggestion calls for codification
of the judicial precedents concerning exigent circumstances. For the reasons stated previously, the Department
does not deem it appropriate to amend this rule to reflect evolving judicial standards. Such standards are incorporated
into Service training programs, enforcement guidelines, and manuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also suggested that the rule should specify which factors Service officers should use to determine
the likelihood of escape. This is the type of discretionary detail that is appropriate in a training course and manual,
but not in a regulation. Finally, the commenters suggested that evidence obtained in violation of rules requiring
warrants should be suppressed in civil deportation hearings. The Department declines to extend by regulation into
civil proceedings the exclusionary rule, which has heretofore been applied exclusively in criminal proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters stated that the rule should provide specific standards governing searches of persons and property
at or inside the border; strip and body cavity searches; vehicle stops and searches of persons and vehicles at or inside
the border; and searches of private dwellings and lands. Section 503 of IMMACT does not require such specificity in
enforcement regulations. Moreover, for that reasons set forth above, such standards will be appropriately addressed
in Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters stated that the authority for issuance of detainers in &sect;&sect;242.2(a)(1) and 287.7(a)(1)
of the proposed rule was overly broad because the authority to issue detainers is limited by section 287(d) of the Act
to persons arrested for controlled substances offenses. This comment overlooked the general authority of the Service
to detain any individual subject to exclusion or deportation proceedings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8 U.S.C. 1225(b), 1252(a)(1). The detainer authority of these sections of the proposed rule were promulgated pursuant
to this general authority. The statutory provision cited by the commenters places special requirements on the Service
regarding the detention of individuals arrested for controlled substance offenses, but does not delimit the general
detainer authority of the Service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters suggested that the Service install seat belts in all vehicles transporting people. Current regulations
under which all motor vehicles, except buses, are manufactured require the factory installation of seat belts. While
the Service strongly agrees with the substance of the suggestion, it would be inappropriate to include any additional
requirements within an administrative rule. The reference to seat belts has been deleted in the final rule because
the standard governing the use of seat belts will be thoroughly addressed in Service training programs, guidelines,
and enforcement manuals.

Section 287.8(e)_Vehicular Pursuits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters stated that the provisions of this section provided inadequate protection to public safety from accidental
injury and death resulting from collisions following high-speed vehicular pursuits. The commenters suggested
that the rule provide that a vehicular pursuit may not be initiated ``when there is imminent danger to the life and safety
of innocent third parties.'' In response to a number of publicized incidents, the Service revised its guidelines
and procedures governing vehicular pursuits. However, it would be inappropriate for the Department to codify the
standard suggested by these commenters in the final rule. The standard is both unduly restrictive and underinclusive.
Actual operating standards for Service officers must permit greater discretion and also specify in greater detail
the criteria that should be considered in deciding whether to undertake a pursuit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter also suggested that officers should be required to successfully complete a separate course in vehicle
pursuit prior to having authority under this section. The Department agrees that only those officers specifically
trained in pursuit techniques should be authorized to undertake a vehicular pursuit. The only such officers at present
who have received such training are border patrol agents. Accordingly, this section has been amended to delete the
designations of special agents and deportation officers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters stated that this section was legally insufficient and should provide more detailed requirements
concerning the obtaining of warrants and consent for site inspections, the determination of ``exigent circumstances,''
and standards and procedures for detention. Commenters specifically suggested that the rule incorporate judicial
precedent based on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution concerning the issuance of warrants, the obtaining of
consent to enter a premises, and the detention of persons subject to questioning; that officers engaged in site inspections
be trained in standards of enforcement and procedure pertaining to site inspections; that Service officers not deliberately
provoke flight by persons in order to justify entry onto a premises; and that Service officers avoid ``unnecessary
embarrassment'' of persons subject to site inspections, as well as verbal abuse, psychological abuse, threats,
and unnecessary physical force.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service agrees with the substance of most of the suggestions made by the commenters, but has not incorporated these
suggestions into the final rule. For the reasons stated previously, the Department does not consider it appropriate
to incorporate evolving judicial precedent into regulations. Such precedents are included in Service training
programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals. In addition, many of the procedural suggestions made by these commenters
either are included in current Service training programs, guidelines, and enforcement manuals or will be considered
for inclusion in these materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also revised the ordering of the paragraphs within this section and has revised the text of paragraph
(2) in the proposed rule, now designated as paragraph (4). The purpose of these changes is to clarify that the conditions
set forth in this section for the conduct of site inspections do not restrict the authority of Service officers to enter
into any area of a business or other activity to which the general public has access or onto open fields that are not farm
or other outdoor agricultural operations without a warrant, consent, or any particularized suspicion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters criticized these provisions of the proposed rule on a number of grounds. The commenters stated that
the rule failed to address the 27 recommendations presented in the Audit Report, ``Immigration and Naturalization
Service Firearms Policy, September 1991,'' prepared by the Department's Office of the Inspector General, Audit
Division. The commenters asserted that the rule's statement that standards on the use of force are based on a force
continuum model taught at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is inadequate and that the rule should adopt
the recommendations of standards for law enforcement agencies developed by the Commission on Accreditation of Law
Enforcement Agencies. The commenters also stated that the rule was too narrow in its statement of the authority to
carry firearms; the commenters recommended that the rule adopt guidelines that reflect the ``multiple psychological
dimensions'' that might influence an officer's behavior. The commenters also urged that the rule incorporate a statement
of 15 Shooting Reduction Techniques published in 1985 by the American Bar Foundation. The commenters stated that
the principle of proportionality must be specifically set forth in the rule's guidelines on the use of force along
with more specific guidelines on the use of force in specific situations that immigration officers are likely to encounter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service agrees that many of the recommendations made by the commenters are sound and should be incorporated into
the training of immigration officers. In fact, a significant portion of the Service firearms training program is
devoted to judgment shooting that includes providing specific scenarios that immigration officers are likely to
face. However, as a matter of Departmental policy, it is not appropriate to incorporate such detailed guidelines
for law enforcement activities into administrative rulemaking. Most of the recommendations made by the Inspector
General in the Audit Report have been, or are in the process of being, adopted or implemented by the Service. The commenters
noted that, in a letter dated August 7, 1991, the Commissioner stated that the issues raised by the Audit Report would
be addressed in the process of drafting these regulations. The recommendations of the Audit Report have been taken
into account in the formulation of this rule. Given the increased training that has been and is being developed, no
specific response to these recommendations is provided in the regulatory text.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the commenters criticized the designation of certain Service officers to carry firearms. The Service
disagrees with the suggestion that there is no justification for immigration inspectors or deportation officers
to carry firearms; this authority is consistent with Department policy in the implementation of other criminal law
enforcement authorities. Such authority is commensurate with the responsibility of such officers to exercise general
arrest and control authority at frequent points of contact with potential criminal offenders. These officers have
also been authorized to carry firearms for many years. The same commenters criticized the rule's delegation to the
Commissioner of authority to designate certain other immigration officers to carry firearms, and stated that any
such designations must be the subject of proposed rulemaking in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act
(APA). Neither section 503 of IMMACT nor the APA requires such discretionary grants of law enforcement authority,
made within general guidelines set forth in regulations, to be the subject of rulemaking. Withdrawing the authority
to make such designations would constitute an unwarranted burden on effective law enforcement. Moreover, the Commissioner's
action is subject to approval by the Deputy Attorney General because the authority to carry a firearm is a traditional
criminal law enforcement authority, not an authority intrinsic to the Service.

The commenters also criticized &sect;287.9(b) for failing to specify procedures to be followed in the investigation
of a shooting incident involving a Service officer and for failing to provide specific rules regarding loss or theft
of an approved firearm, inventory controls on firearms and ammunition, and care and storage of firearms and ammunition.
Section 287.9(b) of the proposed rule stated that these matters would be addressed in guidelines promulgated by the
Commissioner. It is the view of the Department that since all of these matters relate to internal administration,
review, and discipline, the level of detail suggested by the commenters is not appropriate for administrative rulemaking,
but should be addressed through operational guidelines. The requirement that these matters be governed according
to guidelines promulgated by the Commissioner satisfies the congressional mandate set forth in section 503 of IMMACT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also criticized the authorization in &sect;287.9(b) for Service officers to carry personally owned
firearms while on duty, claiming that this will blur the distinction between official and personal use of firearms
and inhibit Service control over the use of firearms. The proposed rule required that all firearms, including those
personally owned, be approved subject to guidelines to be promulgated by the Commissioner. The authority to utilize
a Service-approved, personally owned weapon is needed to respond to the physical diversity of the Service law enforcement
workforce, including specific individual characteristics such as the size of an agent's hand. For example, many
firearms do not comfortably fit in some smaller or larger hands. Accordingly, the rule is designed to allow flexibility
while assuring that each individual agent's firearm has been approved. This is consistent with Departmental policy
for the law enforcement community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters criticized the rule for providing insufficient guidelines on the use of non-deadly force and
insufficient inducements for the use of control devices, such as stun guns and gas guns, that do not inflict bodily
injury. The commenters also stated that the rule should provide specific requirements for the use of self-defense
equipment, including bullet-proof vests and helmets, by Service officers. The Service issues batons, tear gas,
bullet proof vests, and helmets to law enforcement agents, as appropriate, and as appropriated funds permit; the
Service does not issue stun guns, gas guns, or other such devices for routine law enforcement purposes. The Service
and the Department agree that immigration officers should be trained in a broad range of options in the use of force
in order to handle varying situations, that the use of lethal force should be minimized, and that Service officers
should be minimized, and that Service officers should be furnished with self-protection equipment and techniques.
Such standards cannot be appropriately addressed in rulemaking because of the numerous contingencies that are involved.
Service officers are trained in such matters and receive updates in their training to incorporate new law enforcement
techniques and new protective devices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters stated that deadly force is an extreme measure and should only be used when an officer reasonably believes
it is necessary in defense of human life, including the life of the officer or any person in immediate threat of serious
physical harm. To this end, the commenters stated that the rule should require specialized training in specific types
of situations to offer guidance to the officer in order to minimize the use of deadly force. Training should include
ethics, human rights, and alternatives to the use of force and firearms. ``Reasonable belief'' and ``serious bodily
injury'' should be defined, according to the commenters, by current judicial standards. The commenters stated that
the rule should require that where use of deadly force is likely, the officer should give a warning and allow sufficient
time for the warning to be obeyed, but only when the officer or other persons are not at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees with many of these suggestions. Furthermore, the rule is consistent with the Department's
interpretation of

471 U.S. 1 (1985), and its progeny, as applied to the missions of the respective Service officers. However, the Department
disagrees that these issues can be appropriately addressed in this rule. As stated previously, Service training
standards on the use of force are in accordance with prevailing guidelines for all federal law enforcement officials.
These guidelines include provisions addressing the issues identified by the commenters.

Section 287.10_Expedited Internal Review Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters criticized the expedited internal review process proposed in &sect;287.10 as legally insufficient
on a number of grounds. The commenters criticized the proposed rule for incorporating current policies and procedures
of the Department's Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Professional Responsibility, stating that
these policies and procedures do not provide safeguards that are ``accessible and thorough.'' The commenters stated
that the proposed rule provided inadequate notice to the public of its right to lodge complaints. The commenters suggested
that an outreach system, including posters, private telephone for detainers, and a 24-hour toll-free number staffed
by multi-lingual personnel be mandated in the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also stated that a formal procedure for notifying complainants of the receipt and disposition of their
complaints should be implemented by the rule. Confidentiality of complaints should be ensured to protect against
retaliation, and information obtained in the process of investigation complaints should be excluded from use against
the complainant in deportation or exclusion proceedings. The commenters stated that an official record of all complaints,
even unsubstantiated complaints, should be retained so that individual officers can be properly evaluated and,
if necessary, retrained, counseled, or investigated. Some of the commenters suggested that this information, including
unsubstantiated complaints, should be kept in the officer's official personnel file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters suggested that specific procedures for the investigation of complaints, including provisions for
public hearings in the case of serious charges, should be included in the rule. The commenters also stated that an appeals
process should be available in cases where complainants or Service officers are dissatisfied with an investigator's
report and recommendations. Several commenters also stated that the process for reviewing complaints against Service
officers must be improved in order to address allegations of human rights abuses by Service officers patrolling border
areas adjacent to Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Department notes that many of the suggestions made by these commenters are good practices that are
addressed in the policies and procedures of the Department's investigative organizations. However, many of the
specific recommendations regarding notification and timeliness in the completion of investigations are beyond
the scope of this rule and must be addressed in these internal policies and procedures. The Department disagrees with
the suggestion that an appeals process be provided. Sufficient review of investigatory reports is already provided
in the policies and procedures mentioned above. Under these policies and procedures, confidentiality will be maintained
in the course of these investigations. If cause for administrative action is found, the administrative process will
be followed, and if grounds for civil or criminal prosecution are found, the appropriate litigation will be undertaken.
The Department's investigative organizations currently have established procedures to protect the identities
of complainants and witnesses from disclosure to Service personnel. Records of unsubstantiated allegations will
be centrally maintained by the Service for the purposes identified in the comments and to provide a basis for management
review of the number of allegations that have been made to determine whether additional action should be taken at a
management level to improve operations and training, but these records will not be kept in an officer's official personnel
file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also stated that implementation of this section of the rule should be immediate because the reasons
for allowing a one-year delay in the provisions of the rule governing enforcement authority do not apply to internal
review. The Service and the Department would be in a position to agree if, immediately upon publication of the final
rule, the standards were developed and the commensurate training was provided to designated immigration officers.
However, the purpose of the one-year delayed implementation period is to enable the Service to develop the standards,
provide the training, and certify all designated immigration officers. Because &sect;287.10 creates an expedited
review process exclusively for violations of the standards that will be developed during the one-year implementation
period, the effective date of &sect;287.10 must coincide with all other sections of the final rule. However, this
does not alter the established internal review process for alleged violations of existing enforcement policies
and procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters also expressed concern that &sect;287.10(e) of the proposed rule, which would permit Department
components to supplement or expand policies and procedures to ensure proper conduct of Service employees and officers,
should not limit or undermine the regulations that govern the review of allegations of improper conduct by Service
employees and officers. Neither the Department nor the Service intended that &sect;287.10(e) be so construed. It
is the intention of the Department to provide greater assurances that its officers and employees will conduct themselves
appropriately, not to diminish existing standards.

Section 287.11_Disclaimer
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commenters claimed that &sect;287.11 would preclude victims of unlawful Service enforcement practices from
pursuing remedies for regulatory violations. However, this disclaimer merely states that the regulations provide
no independent grounds for relief in any civil or criminal proceeding by any party. It does not prevent any party from
pursuing relief for alleged violations of the Constitution or laws of the United States. As such, the disclaimer is
consistent with the holding in

law enforcement authority and is only intended to ensure that the regulations do not create rights not otherwise existing
in law.

This rule is not considered by the Department of Justice or the Immigration and Naturalization Service to be a ``significant

Interrogation and detention not amounting to arrest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Integration is questioning designed to elicit specific information. An immigration officer, like any other

an individual, not under arrest, to walk away.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the immigration officer has a reasonable suspicion, based on specific articulable facts, that the person being
questioned is, or is attempting to be, engaged in an offense against the United States or is an alien illegally in the
United States, the immigration officer may briefly detain the person for questioning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Information obtained from this questioning may provide the basis for a subsequent arrest, which must be effected
only by a designated immigration officer, as listed in &sect;287.5(c). The conduct of arrests is specified in paragraph

(ii) A warrant of arrest shall be obtained whenever possible prior to the arrest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and to the procedures set forth in &sect;242.2(c)(2) of this chapter if the arrest is made with a warrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) With respect to a person arrested and charged with a criminal violation of the laws of the United States, the arresting
officer shall advise the person of the appropriated rights as required by law at the time of the arrest, or as soon thereafter
as practicable. It is the duty of the immigration officer to assure that the warnings are given in a language the subject
understands, and that the subject acknowledges that the warnings are understood. The fact that a person has been advised
of his or her rights shall be documented on appropriate Service forms and made a part of the arrest record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 All persons will be transported in a manner that ensures the safety of the persons being transported. When persons
arrested or detained are being transported by vehicle, each person will be searched as thoroughly as circumstances
permit before being placed in the vehicle. The person being transported shall not be handcuffed to the frame or any
part of the moving vehicle or an object in the moving vehicle. The person being transported shall not be left unattended
during transport unless the immigration officer needs to perform a law enforcement function.

States unless the officer has either a warrant or the consent of the owner or other person in control of the site to be
inspected. When consent to enter is given, the immigration officer must note on the officer's report that consent
was given and, if possible, by whom consent was given. If the immigration officer is denied access to conduct a site

(3) Adequate records must be maintained noting the results of every site inspection, including those where no illegal
aliens are located.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Nothing in this section prohibits an immigration officer from entering into any area of a business or other activity

without a warrant, consent, or any particularized suspicion in order to question any person whom the officer believes
to be an alien concerning his or her right to be or remain in the United States.

 On April 14, 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota issued a memorandum opinion and order
that, in part, directed the Secretary of Agriculture to issue an amplified decision that more fully explains the conclusions
reached in a final decision published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

of the final decision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 and therefore is excluded from the
requirements of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a final rule on
small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Each order,
as amended, will promote more orderly marketing of milk by producers and regulated handlers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to
have a retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless
they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674) (AMAA), provides that administrative
proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the AMAA, any handler
subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any
obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the
order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing
the Secretary would rule on the petition. The AMAA provides that the district court of the United States in any district
in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the Secretary's
ruling on the petition, provided a complaint is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

When the administrative proceeding in this matter was initiated, the Notice of Hearing listed separately the Lubbock-Plainview,
Texas (Part 1120); the Texas Panhandle (Part 1132); and Rio Grande Valley (Part 1138) orders. A hearing on a merger
of these three orders was held in December 1989. As a result of that hearing, the three orders were merged effective
December 1, 1991, under the name of the New Mexico-West Texas order, which is 7 CFR Part 1138. Therefore, all proposed
order language in connection with this proceeding is in terms of the merged order. In this and future documents in this
proceeding, the New Mexico-West Texas order will replace the three orders named above.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public hearing was held upon proposed amendments to the marketing agreements and the orders regulating the handling
of milk in the New England and other marketing areas. The hearing was held, pursuant to the provisions of the AMAA and
the applicable rules of practice (7 CFR Part 900), at Eau Claire, Wisconsin; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Cloud, Minnesota;
Syracuse, New York; Tallahassee, Florida; and Irving, Texas, on September 5, 1990, through November 20, 1990. Notice
of such hearing was issued on July 11, 1990, and published July 17, 1990 (55 FR 29034). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon the basis of the evidence introduced at the hearing and the record thereof, the Administrator, on November 6,
1991, issued his recommended decision containing notice of the opportunity to file written exceptions thereto.
Following the submission of exceptions and comments on the recommended decision, a final decision was issued on February
5, 1993.

General Basis for This Amplified Decision

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 14, 1994, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota issued a memorandum opinion and order.
The Court held that the Secretary of Agriculture's final decision for the ``1990 National Hearing'' on amending Federal
milk orders was deficient in part. The Court found that the Secretary's decision to retain the existing Class I pricing
structure was tantamount to a finding that the structure continued to satisfy the requirements of the AMAA as set out
in section 608c(18). The Court stated that this conclusion might or might not be supported by the substantial evidence
from the 1990 National Hearing, but since the explicit findings and explanations relative to the &sect;608c(18)
factors were not issued, the Court was unable to make that determination. The final decision was remanded to the Secretary
for 120 days for filing of an amplified decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amplified decision provides additional findings and conclusions that address the material issue on the record
of the 1990 National Hearing concerning Class I milk pricing and related issues. This document provides an amplified
explanation of why the Secretary decided to not change the Class I pricing structure of Federal milk marketing orders
and that such determination is consistent with the pricing requirements of section 608c(18) of the AMAA.

Whenever the Secretary finds, upon the basis of the evidence adduced at the hearing required by section 608b of this
title or this section, as the case may be, that the parity prices of such commodities are not reasonable in view of the
price of feeds, the available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand
for milk and its products in the marketing area to which the contemplated agreement, order, or amendment relates,
he shall fix such prices as he finds will reflect such factors, insure a sufficient quantity of pure and wholesome milk
to meet current needs and further to assure a level of farm income adequate to maintain productive capacity sufficient
to meet anticipated future needs, and be in the public interest.

The statute mandates a two-step analysis for determining the appropriate level of prices under Federal milk market
orders. The first step involves ascertainment of parity prices. If the Secretary finds that the parity price levels
are not reasonable, then the second step requires investigation of appropriate price levels. Both pricing standards
require recognition of explicit statutory factors, namely the price of feeds, the available supplies of feeds, and
other economic conditions which affect market supply and demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parity prices are, and have been, at a level that is significantly higher than the prices applicable in competitive
milk markets. At the administrative hearing, official notice was requested and granted for a regular publication
of the United States Department of Agriculture titled ``Dairy Situation and Outlook Yearbook'', DS&hyph;426, Economic
Research Service, August 1990. On page 10, Table 1._United States dairy situation at a glance, annual average numbers
are listed for prices received by farmers (all-milk price for milk sold to plants) and how this price level relates
to the parity price measure. The statistics reveal that over the 7-year period from 1983 through 1989, the simple average
all-milk price was approximately 55 percent of the value of the calculated parity price level. These statistics show
that the calculated parity price levels relative to the all-milk price would be excessively high because more than
ample supplies of milk were available for all uses at prices far below the parity price level, and thus, the parity price
is not reasonable. This finding was set forth in the final decision at 58 FR 12675. Accordingly, the second step of the
section 608c(18) analysis was undertaken. The second step of price determination requires a more in-depth analysis
of dairy market structure. The statute allows the Secretary to decide the price levels that will achieve articulated
market performance goals: the chosen prices must ensure a sufficient supply of pure and wholesome milk to meet current
and future market needs and be in the public interest. As outlined below, the Secretary conducted an extensive analysis
of each individual marketing order in light of the statutorily-required dairy market performance goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 7 U.S.C. 608c(18), any administratively recognized price level must reflect the price of feeds, the
available supplies of feeds, and other economic conditions that affect market supply and demand. The key economic
concept focuses on supply and demand. Milk markets consist of both buyers and sellers, the buyer representing a demand
for what the seller can supply. Each side could be studied independently. However, it is the simultaneous consideration
of all sides of the market that the Secretary must address when regulating dairy markets and in determining reasonable
price levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To this end, federal order markets utilize an unregulated and competitive market equilibrium price that measures
all economic factors affecting the supply of and demand for milk and its products that captures all of the pricing criteria
established by section 608c(18). As discussed below, this price is embodied in the Minnesota-Wisconsin (M&hyph;W)
price. This price indicates the price-quantity relationship that buyers and sellers arrive at in a market where transactions
are free of government intervention, the competition for milk is the most competitive, and milk products produced
compete in a national market. The M&hyph;W price automatically adjusts to prevailing market supply and demand conditions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to adoption of the M&hyph;W price, federal milk orders relied upon various procedures to establish a basic milk
price. Using different measures, each of these procedures attempted to identify the competitive value of milk used
for manufacturing purposes. For example, certain orders variously based class prices on prices paid by specific
manufacturing plants, such as the Midwestern Condensary Series; on local plant averages; on a three-product U.S.
manufacturing price; or on product formulae, such as the butter/powder or butter/cheese formulae. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One major problem with these pricing methods was the difficulty in keeping the pricing methods up-to-date with changes
taking place within the dairy industry. For example, varying local needs required that some milk be shipped from plants
to meet fluid demands and thus skewed plant-based formulae by affecting yields and prices of manufactured products
produced from reserve milk. Moreover, cost factors, which do not lend themselves to accurate evaluation or precise
and timely measurement, also complicated efforts to utilize efficiently these various formulae. Changes in labor
costs and technology similarly could not be reflected in these product price formulae in a timely fashion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, there was growing recognition that a competitive pay price which would automatically adjust to prevailing
supply and demand conditions (including feed cost and availability) would provide the most practical and reasonable
answer to shortcomings in the then-existing pricing methods. The superiority of using a competitive pay price rests
upon the economic principle that dairy processors in a highly competitive economy will tend to purchase milk at prices
close to the price an efficient processor could pay for that product. Increasing labor and other costs tend to reduce
prices that processors are willing to pay for milk. On the other hand, new assembling, processing, packaging and marketing
techniques that reduce costs or increase product returns tend to increase the prices processors are willing to pay
producers for milk. As these factors fluctuate, shifts occur in the prices that different processors may be able to
pay producers. Other groups of processors must meet or approximate these prices or risk losing their supplies of milk.
Similarly, various economic factors affecting producers (i.e., taxes, inflation, feed costs, capital assets costs,
salaries, etc.) are automatically reflected in the competitive price that producers are willing and able to charge
for their milk. Therefore, a competitive pay price was and is viewed as an excellent and superior indicator of the upward
and downward adjustments in costs which are automatically reflected in market prices paid to producers for their
milk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The M&hyph;W price is a competitive equilibrium market price that represents an estimate of the average of prices
paid to dairy farmers for Grade B milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin by plants producing manufactured dairy products
such as butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese. The M&hyph;W price was first adopted in 1961 as the basis for setting all
minimum classified milk prices in the Chicago Regional marketing area. By 1975, the M&hyph;W price had been adopted
by all federal milk orders. Both the industry and the Secretary view the M&hyph;W price as an accurate indicator of
the value of milk in large part because the price reflects all of the supply and demand conditions that must be considered
under section 608c(18). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufactured dairy products (cheese, butter, and nonfat dry milk) can be made from Grade B or Grade A milk. Because
manufactured dairy products are eight to ten times less bulky than raw farm milk and can be stored for much longer periods
of time than raw farm milk, these manufactured products are less expensive to move and market than raw farm milk on a
per pound basis. As a result, manufactured dairy products can and do compete on a national market basis while competition
for raw and packaged fluid milk occurs on a more local or regional level.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, since manufacture dairy products (unlike fluid milk) compete in a national market, there is a relationship
between the M&hyph;W price for Grade B milk and the price of surplus Grade A milk, which, like Grade B milk, is used to
produce manufactured dairy products. The M&hyph;W price reflects a competitive free market price for raw farm milk
and the explicit link between Grade B and Grade A surplus milk prices. Thus, the M&hyph;W price automatically incorporates
the effects of innumerable economic factors which have an impact on both buyers and sellers including the relative
price and availability of feed for dairy cows. Month-to-month changes in the unregulated free market M&hyph;W price
(i.e., the price of Grade B milk) reflect changes in the overall supply and demand conditions for milk and its products
nationally. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concern for the need to ensure competitive equity among handlers and the existence of basic price differences between
adjacent marketing areas also led to the universal adoption of the M&hyph;W price in all federal milk orders. Marketing
areas which relied on the other basic pricing formulae noted above often resulted in producer prices that were too
low compared to those received by Midwestern producers. This situation created a competitive disadvantage for Midwestern
processors with respect to sales of such manufactured dairy products as butter, nonfat dry milk and cheese because
these products, which compete on a national rather than ``local'' market, were more expensive relative to similar
products manufactured elsewhere. Consequently, it became clear that a competitive pay price would most accurately
indicate the basic value of milk on a national level. Use of the M&hyph;W price which, as noted above, is a competitive
pay price, automatically indicates the basic value of milk and eliminates the need for making possibly inaccurate
judgments concerning particular products, prices, yield factors and manufacturing allowances which otherwise
would be used to calculate product price formulae. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In short, the M&hyph;W price provides automatic adjustments concerning all of the factors affecting the supply of
and demand for milk and its products. Thus, the M&hyph;W price has been adopted in all federal milk orders as the ``mover''
of all Class I and Class II prices and is the Class III price (subject to certain minor adjustments). Using the M&hyph;W
as the Class III price maintains price coordination between Grade B and surplus Grade A milk supplies used for manufacturing
purposes.

Price and Supplies of Feed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Agricultural commodities typically follow cyclical price-quantity patterns. Given fixed levels of demand, as
supplies become plentiful, price for feed trends downward. When supplies become scarce, price for feed trends upward.
The market signals incorporated into the M&hyph;W price indicate price movements up and down and elicit either more
or less commodity production. This coupling pattern between feed supplies and feed prices allows market analysts
to focus on either factor and implicitly know what the other is doing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cost of feed is a significant factor involved in milk production. Officially noticed documents that are part of
the record of the administrative hearing outline cash feed expenses as they relate to the total economic costs of producing
milk. (``Economic Indicators of the Farm Sector: Costs of Production, Economic Research Service'', ECIFS 3&hyph;1,
1983; ECIFS 6&hyph;1, 1986; and ECIFS 9&hyph;1, 1989.) For the period 1981 through 1989, data describing the annual
average cost of producing one hundred pounds of milk were reviewed. Statistics for six individual regions plus the
entire United States were examined. Information for one additional region was available for the 1987, 1988, and 1989
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual regional and total United States summary statistics for a nine-year period from 1981 through 1989 were reviewed.
The review of these statistics revealed that the total cash feed expenses as a percentage of the total economic costs
of production, on a per hundredweight (cwt.) basis, ranged from 30 percent to 58 percent from year-to-year. This percentage
measures the relative significance of cash feed expenses for each region and the United States relative to the estimated
total cost of milk production for the respective regions and the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the availability and cost of feed are primary factors involved in farm level milk production, there is a limit
to how much milk output can be obtained from a given quantity of feed input. This is a physical milk production constraint.
It relates to the biological limits of the cow and the economics of milk production decisions made by individual farmers.
In general, given a specified level of feed costs, a dairy farmer decides to purchase and/or grow a quantity of feed
and forage. This in turn determines the amount of feed that may be made available to cows for milk production and has
a direct impact on the aggregate level of milk that may be produced in absence of any consideration being given to the
price that can be obtained for the milk that is produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such analysis of the availability and costs of feed provides only one dimension, albeit an important dimension, of
the factors the Secretary must consider in establishing a price for milk. These important statutory pricing factors,
however, are automatically embodied in the M&hyph;W price. The M&hyph;W is a superior basic price indicator for milk
because it reflects all of the economic factors that affect the supply of milk as well as all of the factors that affect
the demand for the products of milk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the rulemaking record contains ample evidence regarding the price and availability of feeds which the
agency reviewed when making its decision. However, these factors, as well as all other supply and demand factors,
continued to be automatically reflected in the M&hyph;W price, which has long been the moving factor in the Class I
(and also Class II and III) prices.

The Class I Price and Class I Differential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Class I price in each order contains two components. The largest component is the M&hyph;W price, which applies
in all orders. The smaller component is a Class I differential that is specific to each order. Consequently, through
the M&hyph;W component the Class I price in each order automatically reflects the price and availability of supplies
of feed and all other economic factors that affect the supply and demand for milk and dairy products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raw milk is a bulky product and is more expensive to transport than the equivalent amount of milk used to produce concentrated
manufactured dairy products. There is a direct link between weight and the cost of moving milk across geographic areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Class I differential part of the Class I price is intended to partially reflect the cost of transporting milk. The
differential portion serves as a price incentive to draw milk from supply areas toward metropolitan demand centers.
One of the statutory objectives of the Federal milk order program is to provide a sufficient amount of fluid milk for
consumers. The differential serves as an incentive to move milk from supply areas to demand centers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In economic terms, a spatial pricing structure for milk evolves when it traverses geographic space. The structure
is characterized by a price at the area of supply. Such price increases proportionally as the distance to the area of
demand increases. It is noted that there does not need to be a single defined supply area. Furthermore, it is not necessary
that prices be identical at all recognized supply areas. Many different supply areas could be considered. However,
distance and the cost of transportation implicitly and efficiently link demand areas to the nearest and/or least
cost area of supply. The spatial Class I milk pricing structure recognizes these economic relationships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court's opinion appears to misconstrue the Secretary's description regarding the Class I differential and transportation
cost. The Court observed that:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]he Secretary expressly states in his final decision that the differentials are no longer meant to reflect the cost
of transportation *&blank;*&blank;* (Opinion, p.7). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In fact, the final decision pointed out that ``the Class I pricing structure does not cover the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
total
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 cost of moving bulk fluid milk from one area to another.'' (58 FR 12648, emphasis added). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In short, the relevant factor that establishes a limit for Class I differentials is the cost of transportation. Class
I differentials partially reflect the cost of transportation at a level that will insure an adequate supply of milk
pursuant to statutory objectives. Because some milk is produced just about everywhere, the mix of milk produced near
consumption centers with milk shipped from distant areas varies among orders. If no nearby milk is produced for a particular
consumption center, the Class I differential would have to more fully reflect the cost of transporting milk from the
nearest alternative surplus milk-producing area. However, because some milk is produced just about everywhere,
the Class I differential in any particular marketing area merely has to be high enough to bring forth adequate supplies
of locally produced milk together with supplemental supplies from other areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the mobility of milk increased, a transition necessarily occurred from considering only isolated local markets
to considering a system of regional markets that are linked through class price coordination. Individual markets
that previously set class prices based on local supply-demand conditions now are part of larger regional markets
whose prices are coordinated through the 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
M&hyph;W price as the price mover in federal milk marketing orders. Once the M&hyph;W price was adopted, there was
a common mechanism for coordinating market price movements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From the regulatory perspective, the statutory goal of providing an adequate milk supply for each market is furthered
by coordinating milk prices among the system of orders. Based upon the cost of moving milk, Class I differentials are
established so that the price of milk at any plant location does not exceed the cost of transporting milk from supply
areas. Proper alignment of milk prices between nearby adjacent markets is necessary so that handlers located in more
deficit milk producing areas can attract a supply of milk.

The Blend Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Handlers in each order account for milk in Class I, Class II, and Class III uses at the minimum respective class price
established under each order. The blend price that applies to producers is calculated by dividing the total pounds
of producer milk into the total value of all milk at class prices used by handlers regulated under an order. Accordingly,
the blend price is a weighted average price that, because all milk of an order is part of the price calculation, assures
that each producer shares in both the benefits of supplying the fluid milk market and the burden of the reserve or surplus
milk supplies associated with each order. Thus, the blend price incorporates regional and national measures: it
is a measure of supply and demand conditions in each order as well as a measure of national supply and demand conditions
that are reflected in the class prices that are based on the M&hyph;W price. Blend prices increase or decrease as class
prices increase or decrease in response to changes in national supply and demand conditions. Also, the blend price
in each market increases or decreases as the Class III use in each market decreases or increases. Thus, blend prices
reflect all of the economic factors that affect the supply of and demand for milk and dairy products that are required
to be considered under the pricing criteria of the AMAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Producers make their production and marketing adjustments on the basis of changes in blend prices and differences
in blend prices among orders. It is not uncommon for supply areas of individual orders to expand or contract in response
to blend price changes over time. Also, because milk is free to move to handlers regulated under different orders,
it is not uncommon for milk to shift from one order to another in response to blend price differences that result from
changes in supply and demand conditions under different orders.

USDA's Supply-Demand Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A supply and demand analysis was conducted by USDA to consider the Class I differential portion of the Class I prices.
This analysis was based on the hearing record, exceptions, and comments, and was a proper and sufficient economic
review of dairy market performance. By focusing on milk market performance measures, USDA's analysis directly addressed
the statutory goal of ensuring adequate milk supplies to meet the needs of each federal milk marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The examination conducted by USDA reviewed the level of Class III utilization for each market area. This market performance
measure is appropriate because of the basic underlying accounting definitions and regulations in all federal milk
orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, each marketing order defines producer milk receipts as all Grade A milk that is associated with (i.e.,
used in) the particular order market. The producer receipts may be from dairy farms in or close to the defined ``marketing
area'', or it may come from dairy farms that are located hundreds of miles away. The key identifying factor is that the
milk is associated with the market as evidenced by its receipt by handlers regulated under that particular order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific market definitions also describe milk used for Class I, Class II, and Class III uses based on the end products
made from such milk. The standard accounting identity applicable for all federal milk market orders requires that
the total amount of milk used in Class I, Class II, and Class III products equals the total amount of producer milk receipts
associated with each market order. The class utilization percentages are determined by dividing the amount of milk
used in each respective class by the amount of producer receipts for the market. In this manner, the class utilization
percentage represents how much milk is being used in each class of product relative to the total volume of milk associated
with a specifically defined geographic Federal milk marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Markets generally function by serving Class I demand first, then meeting Class II demands, and finally utilizing
the residual volume of producer receipts as Class III. In this manner, the volume of milk utilized in Class III is an
indication of the surplus, or reserve, milk level available to meet any supplemental needs of the Class I and Class
II market. During certain periods of the year, the level of milk production is low while the demand for Class I and Class
II milk is high. In these deficit periods, it may be necessary to use all milk regularly associated with the market to
meet the Class I demand. A certain portion of the milk supply in most markets also is needed to meet regular Class II milk
demands; consequently, a reserve milk supply of 30 to 35 percent (i.e., Class III percent utilization) is not excessive
to ensure that sufficient milk is available in the market at all times to satisfy Class I and II demand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court's opinion suggests that the Secretary's reliance on producer milk in his analysis of whether Class I prices
meet the statutory price considerations required by Section 608c(18) does not consider milk supplies available
outside the marketing area (Opinion, p.20). In fact, producer milk and, more specifically, Class III utilization
does incorporate the availability of milk supplies from outside a marketing area because, regardless of its origin,
any milk received by a regulated handler in a marketing area is, by definition, producer milk. Thus, the Class III utilization
of producer milk is an important indicator of federal order supply and demand conditions.

*&blank;*&blank;* There is no national supply and demand standard for the order program as a whole. This is not to say
that a regulated market cannot rely on milk supplies from another area, as is often the case. Nevertheless, viewed

are adequate, but not excessive in most markets.

The above finding is in the first of three paragraphs that respond to an exception filed by the Upper Midwest Federal
Order Coalition (UMFOC) that maintained the Secretary used too high a measure of what should be considered a reasonable
reserve. The Secretary indicated that there was a range of views expressed concerning reserve supplies needed to
serve Class I needs on a year-round basis. (58 FR 12646) When both Class I and Class II needs are considered, the Secretary
indicated that this analysis of supply and demand for milk on the various markets and regions was valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the M&hyph;W is a measure of supply and demand factors throughout the country. However, there is no
single national standard for determining how much reserve milk should be, or needs to be, associated with each marketing
order. The amount of reserve milk varies among orders as a result of different circumstances that affect production
and marketing practices and conditions. Some regions are affected more than others from year to year by variations
in weather conditions that have an impact on milk production and reserve milk supplies. Also, some areas are more heavily
involved in manufacturing than others. The amount of involvement has an impact on the amount of reserve milk that is
historically associated with certain federal order markets relative to others. Moreover, since the blend price
drives producers' production and marketing decisions, milk is shifted to alternative outlets and orders to take
advantage of higher prices. This shifting of milk supplies impacts on the amount of reserve milk associated with different
orders. Also, milk may be alternatively associated or disassociated from orders altogether depending on the blend
price level of a federal milk order relative to returns from unregulated manufacturing plants. Consequently, Class
III milk utilization is an important indicator of a market's performance and its ability to meet Class I needs. For
these reasons, the Secretary's reliance on producer milk and Class III utilization is appropriate and automatically
considers the availability of milk supplies from outside a marketing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As detailed in the final decision, the supply-demand analysis conducted by the Secretary considered the level of
Class III milk utilization relative to the established Class I price differential. Most markets appeared to have
a relative balance between supply and demand, while some markets were deficit and others were surplus. On a system-wide
basis considering all of the testimony from the hearing, comments, and exceptions, the Secretary properly determined
that the current Class I differentials were meeting the statutorily described market performance measures.

 The Humane Society of the United States recommended that all seasons open at noon, mid-week, to reduce the large kills
associated with the traditional Saturday openings. They recommend special seasons be discontinued for the same
purpose. One individual from California suggested that the waterfowl bag limits and seasons should be established
on a flyway basis. Two local sportsmen's organization from Massachusetts requested that shooting hours remain one-half
hour before sunrise to sunset.

 An individual representing a group of duck hunters from Wisconsin expressed concern that some States with a September
teal season are allowed shooting hours that begin one-half hour before sunrise. He believes that hunters are unable
to identify ducks and that most crippling loss occurs prior to sunrise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that Michigan be allowed to conduct a teal season in areas
where teal concentrate. They proposed limiting the season to no more than 2,000 hunters and believed that hunters'
skills at identifying waterfowl are better now than they were during initial evaluations of teal seasons in the 1960's.
Four individuals from Michigan supported the proposed September teal season for portions of Michigan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Breeding population information for 1994 and harvest and band-recovery information from the 1993&hyph;94 waterfowl
season indicate that a September teal season can be offered to nonproduction States of the Central and Mississippi
Flyways in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During their 1993-94 teal seasons, the States of Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas in the Central flyway
and Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi in the Mississippi Flyway participated in a study that indicated that shooting
hours beginning at one-half hour before sunrise during teal seasons have a negligible impact on nontarget duck species
in those States. The Service believes the data are sufficient to address its concern about the potential harvest of
nontarget species during the presunrise period, and will permit those States that participated in the study to have
presunrise shooting hours during the 1994 teal season, without further evaluation. Other States that are permitted
a teal season (Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Ohio), but did not participate in the study, must begin
shooting hours at sunrise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes the value of these September teal seasons in providing additional hunting opportunity but
remains concerned about the potential impacts of these seasons on non-target species in certain areas. The Service
strategy regarding use of teal seasons specifies that teal seasons can be offered only to nonproduction States of
the Central and Mississippi Flyways. Because Michigan is considered a production State and was not part of the original,
comprehensive evaluation, the Service does not support the requests for a teal season. Although the definitions
of production and nonproduction States may need to be reviewed, the Service has stated in the August 23, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 44577) that it prefers a Flyway-wide approach to assess whether expansion of teal seasons to areas beyond those
currently allowed is permissible. The Michigan proposal does not meet this criterion. The Service also notes that
such expansions would require a reevaluation of the entire teal season, including an analysis of information from
areas currently permitted teal seasons as well as areas into which teal seasons might be expanded.

 Several individuals and petitions with 4,697 signatures requested nine additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin.
The request notes that the efforts of duck hunters, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Ducks Unlimited,
and various sportsmen's organizations have resulted in record levels of duck production. The additional nine days
of duck hunting would make Wisconsin's season equal in length to certain other States in the Mississippi Flyway that
are permitted a September teal season.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service previously determined in the ``Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations
Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (SEIS 88)'' that the extension of framework dates into September
for Iowa's September duck season was a type of special season. The Service further acknowledges that the 1990 assessment
of special September teal seasons included data from Iowa's September duck season segments during 1979-87. As such,
the effects of Iowa's special seasons were taken into account when determining the appropriateness of September
teal seasons as a harvest-management tool. Iowa's data also suggested little impact on other duck species during
this season. Therefore, the Service believes that Iowa's September duck season segment, as conducted during 1979-87,
is consistent with the Service's policy regarding the use of special seasons. Current status information for the
blue-winged teal supports Iowa's request for a September duck season in 1994. The Service stated in SEIS 88 that special
seasons should be re-evaluated periodically to assess potential changes in impacts to the waterfowl resource. The
Service notes that more than a decade has passed since Iowa conducted its evaluation of this season and requests that
Iowa collect information documenting the effect of this season on other duck species in Iowa. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the requests for additional days of duck hunting in Wisconsin, an important consideration in the establishment
of hunting regulations is the distinction between regular hunting seasons and special seasons. Regular seasons
are developed by Flyway/management unit, and the same season length, bag limit, etc. are provided for all States in
that Flyway/management unit. Special seasons, however, usually involve additional harvest opportunity and are
focused on a single species or group of species. Because of this, the use of these seasons is limited to times and areas
where the species or group is sufficiently isolated to minimize impacts on other species/groups. This limitation
increases the likelihood that in some cases a special season or some compensating increase in other harvest opportunity
cannot be available to all States. The September teal season is an example. Wisconsin is one of nine States in the Mississippi
and Central Flyways that are not eligible for this special season.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Humane Society of the United States (Humane Society) opposed this season in the Atlantic Flyway because they believe
crippling and wanton waste occur, information is insufficient to justify a season, and available data indicate possible
declines for certain sea duck species. They believe that season length and bag limits in the Atlantic Flyway should
be reduced substantially until more complete information on biology and population status is available. They repeat
their concern regarding seasons and limits on sea ducks which are deemed too liberal, considering the quality and
quantity of data on population status and trends, and recommend reductions in those regulations. The Humane Society
notes that apparently the Pacific Flyway Council has not completed a comparable evaluation of its sea duck harvests
and believes such seasons should be closed until necessary data are obtained. Two local organizations from Massachusetts
requested a continuation of the 107-day sea duck season, with a 7-bird bag limit to include scoters.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service continues to be concerned about the status of sea ducks and the potential impact that increased hunting
activity could have on these species. In recognition of the need for additional information on these species, the
Service prepared a report (dated June, 1993) on sea duck and merganser hunting seasons, status, and harvests in Alaska
and the Pacific Flyway coastal states. This document was prepared for use by the Service and the Pacific Flyway Council
in evaluating the effects of seasons on these ducks. There is no special season on sea ducks in the Pacific Flyway; however,
Alaska has a sea duck limit that is additional to the limit on other ducks. In the Atlantic Flyway, a report was recently
completed (dated April, 1994) and distributed, describing the status of sea ducks in that portion of the continent.
Cooperative efforts are ongoing to summarize additional information on sea ducks, however the Service continues
to emphasize the importance of completing the sea duck management plan. Furthermore, the Service considers improvements
in survey capabilities for these species to be extremely important for future management actions. In 1993, the Service
reduced bag limits on scoters from 7 to 4 within an overall 7-bird sea duck limit. The Service will continue to monitor
these species and notes that further harvest restrictions may be necessary.

the zone in the Upper Peninsula to approximately the eastern half of the Peninsula; change the season length in the
southern part of the Lower Peninsula from 10 to 15 days (September 1&hyph;15) for 3 years and include the southern portions
of Tuscola and Huron Counties. The proposed changes would be experimental.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service agrees with the proposed changes to resident Canada goose seasons in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin and the new seasons in Tennessee and West Virginia.
All of these proposed changes are considered experimental and subject to evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service notes that all of the seasons proposed in the Mississippi Flyway, except those for Michigan, Minnesota
and Tennessee, were not proposed as experimental. The Service remains committed to population-specific management
of Canada geese. However, the Service believes that the contribution of different goose populations to the goose
harvest during special seasons must be determined experimentally. For this reason, the Service has established
criteria for special Canada goose seasons (58 FR 44578&hyph;44579), which clearly state the need for experimental
evaluation of new seasons, including extensions of geographic areas or times. Therefore, the Service agrees to the
changes proposed by the Mississippi Flyway Council, but on an experimental basis and provided an approved evaluation
is conducted as specified in the existing criteria.

 The Michigan Department of Natural Resources believes that regular goose seasons should be allowed to open as early
as September 24 in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They noted that significant numbers of migrant geese begin arriving
in the Upper Peninsula during September 20&hyph;24 in most years. They anticipate that harvest in this region would
remain small compared to the rest of the State. They also believe that nearly all Canada geese harvested in this region
are of the giant subspecies or the Mississippi Valley Population. Finally, they noted that allowing a September 24
opening would provide equitable hunting opportunity compared to other areas because most geese leave this region
by early November.

The Association of Village Council Presidents, representing Native American interests in the Yukon-Kuskokwim
Delta area of Alaska, supported modest liberalizations of white-fronted goose seasons in Alaska and Washington.
However, they did not support further liberalizations in Oregon or California, noting that liberalizations occurred
during each of the preceding years and that it was difficult to measure the effects of these incremental changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service concurs with the September 24 opening of regular Canada goose seasons in Wisconsin and in Michigan's Upper
Peninsula. The Service routinely monitors Canada goose seasons for impacts on the Southern James Bay Population
through its harvest surveys and reviews of State evaluation reports on special seasons.

The population index for cackling Canada geese was 164,300 geese in 1993, which was 10 percent above the 1992 index
and the largest since this special survey was initiated in 1979. The Service supports the Pacific Flyway Council's
recommendation for a resumption of the season on these geese and frameworks described herein reflect that change.
Section 7 consultation is an integral part of the season-setting process.

The population index for the Pacific Population of white-fronted geese was 295,000 in November 1993 and near the population

affecting white-fronted goose harvests in Washington, Oregon, and California, however, will be deferred to the

 (59 FR 16765) which indicated that there should be no increase or shift in crane harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation
of Mid-Continent Sandhill Cranes and especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. They noted that the Central
Flyway Council did not propose any framework changes for the 1994&hyph;95 seasons and asked for clarification of
the reasons for this concern, especially since the population remains stable. In this regard, they suggested that
the Service provide a harvest objective, rationale and method of evaluation of any harvest reduction proposed. Furthermore,
the appropriate level of management should be clearly identified, i.e. population, subpopulation, or subspecies
level. Although biologists working in Texas support management at the population or subpopulation level, they indicated
that zoning for the hunting of cranes could not be attempted until these issues had been resolved.

 In 1993, the Central and Pacific Flyways completed a revision of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent
Population of sandhill cranes. This revision established a goal of a stable population at levels observed during
the 1982&hyph;92 period and removed the harvest threshold (25,000) that had been in place since 1981. The Service
believes that future management actions for Mid-Continent cranes should be based on the recognition of biologically
discrete subpopulations, which would necessitate the development of certain data collection efforts at the subspecies
level. In the April 9, 1993,

 (59 FR 16765), the Service reiterated its concern that overall harvest levels should not be increased and that there
should be no increase or shift in harvest toward the Gulf Coast Subpopulation or to the greater sandhill crane component.
The Service supports continuation of last year's frameworks but remains extremely concerned about possible increases
or shifts in harvest toward the Gulf Coast subpopulation, especially the greater-sandhill-crane component. The
Service considers a harvest threshold to be an integral component of the Cooperative Management Plan for the Mid-Continent
Population and hopes that the newly-formed crane working group, appointed by the Central Flyway Council, will strongly
reconsider the need for a harvest threshold in the development of a harvest strategy for this population.

 The Service is concerned about the gradual long-term declines in woodcock populations in both the Eastern and Central
management regions. Although habitat changes appear to be the primary factor in the declines, adjustment of harvest
opportunities may be appropriate in light of current population trends. The Service will work with the Atlantic and
Mississippi Flyway Councils to review the status of woodcock and cooperatively develop a harvest-management strategy.
The Service believes that zoning has the potential to increase the harvest of woodcock. Therefore, the Service does
not support a zoned woodcock season at a time when woodcock populations are declining and restrictive harvest regulations
are being considered to bring harvest opportunities to levels commensurate with current populations.

 The Service supports the continuation of seasons on both the Coastal and Interior Populations. Regarding the Coastal
Population, the Service has reviewed recent population status and harvest information provided by the States. This
information indicates that the Coastal Population probably numbers between 2 and 3 million birds and that the 1993
harvest did not exceed 16,000 band-tails. However, the Service remains concerned about the long-term decline of
this population and continues to support restrictive harvest regulations. Again this year, all States having band-tailed
pigeon hunting seasons must require band-tailed pigeon hunters to obtain mandatory State permits (or participate
in the nationwide Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program) to provide a sampling frame for obtaining more precise
estimates of band-tailed pigeon harvest. Those States not participating in the Migratory Bird Harvest Information
Program will be required to conduct a harvest survey and provide the results to the Service by June 1, 1995.

 (58 FR 44581), the Service noted that the proliferation of zones and split seasons is contrary to the preferred alternative
in the ``1988 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport
Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88-14).'' In regard to Texas, the Service noted that no other States are allowed to
select both 3 zones and 3 splits for any species; in fact, no State other than Texas is allowed to select 3 zones for doves.
The Service also expressed concern about the ability to detect and measure possible changes in harvest that may result
from those additional splits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Service is concerned about changes in the schedule for inclusion of States in the Harvest Information

doves and other migratory game birds. This information is needed to evaluate changes in hunting seasons such as the
proposed change in Service policy governing zones and splits in Texas.

birds is comparatively light. Many northern species will have migrated from the State before seasons open there in
September and there is no evidence to indicate that regulated hunting has adversely impacted local populations.

In August 1994, the Division of Endangered Species concluded that the proposed action is not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical
habitats. Hunting regulations are designed, among other things, to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between
seasons for migratory game birds and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species and their
habitats. The Service's biological opinions resulting from its consultation under section 7 are considered public
documents and are available for inspection in the Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird
Management.

Regulations Promulgation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting regulations must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints.
However, the Service is of the view that every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possible opportunity
to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed early-season rulemaking was published on July 13, the Service
established what it believed was the longest period possible for public comment. In doing this, the Service recognized
that, at the close of the comment period, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective
date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, the Service is of the opinion that the States would have insufficient
time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to the Service; and to establish and publicize
the necessary regulations and procedures that implement their decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Service, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703&hyph;712),
prescribes final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting
hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State
and Territory conservation agency officials may select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season
and option selections from these officials, the Service will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the contiguous United
States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, for the 1993&hyph;94 season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service therefore finds that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is denying a petition for rulemaking (PRM&hyph;50&hyph;53) from Ms. Susan
L. Hiatt on behalf of the Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc. (OCRE). The petition requested reopening of the
rulemaking procedure that led to promulgation of 10 CFR 50.62, the ``Anticipated Transient Without Scram'' (ATWS)
rule. The principal basis for the OCRE request was the possibility that the ATWS analyses that formed the underlying
bases of the ATWS rule were invalid because they did not appropriately account for the effects of large power oscillations,
such as those that occurred during the March 9, 1988, instability event at the LaSalle County Nuclear Station (Unit
2). The petition is being denied because the Commission has concluded, based on core stability analyses during hypothetical
ATWS events, and based on recommended procedure changes at nuclear power plants, that large-amplitude power oscillations
will not impact the core and containment response sufficiently to invalidate the assumptions and results of previous
ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule. The NRC has carefully considered the issues raised in the petition
and has taken them into account in reaching its decision to deny the petition.

The Petition

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated July 22, 1988, Ms. Susan L. Hiatt, a representative of the Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy, Inc.,
requested that the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR), take immediate action with respect to boiling
water reactors (BWRs) to relieve what she alleged to be undue risks to the public health and safety posed by the thermal-hydraulic
instability of BWRs as revealed by an event at LaSalle County Station, Unit 2, on March 9, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner requested that the NRC conduct a rulemaking procedure under 10 CFR 2.802 to address: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The possibility that the analyses used during the proceedings that promulgated 10 CFR 50.62 (the ``ATWS'' rule)
were invalid because they did not appropriately account for the effect of large power oscillations (those analyses
were the underlying basis for the design requirements established in 10 CFR 50.62 to reduce the risk from ATWS events);
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The appropriateness of the 10 CFR 50.62 requirement for automatic tripping of the recirculation pumps in response
to designated ATWS signals. In light of the potential consequences of large power oscillations, since tripping the
recirculation pumps moves reactor operation into a state with high power-to-flow ratio where oscillations are likely,
the petitioner requested that the pump-tripping requirement be reconsidered.

Staff Action on the Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has been reviewing generic concerns regarding the large power oscillations that were observed during the
March 9, 1988, instability event at the LaSalle County Nuclear Station, Unit 2, since the event's occurrence. That
part of the effort that has focused on developing a response to the OCRE petition has concentrated on developing an
improved understanding of BWR stability phenomena. These staff [and associated Boiling Water Reactor Owner's Group
(BWROG)] efforts have included analytical studies of ATWS scenarios, stability sensitivity studies, and the validation
and verification of the analytical models and codes used for these studies. The primary objective was to determine
if large-amplitude oscillations might impact the core and containment response sufficiently to invalidate the
assumptions and results of previous ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to OCRE's contention that the automatic tripping of the recirculation pumps in response to designated
ATWS signals, as required by the ATWS rule, is inappropriate in light of the potential consequences of large power
oscillations, the staff reviewed the advantages (related to decreased heat load on the containment) and disadvantages
(related to exacerbation of power oscillations) of the requirement that the recirculation pumps be tripped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Reasons for Denial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attachments to the NRC's letter to the petitioner (SECY&hyph;94&hyph;123) includes a detailed presentation
of the bases for the denial of the petition. In summary, a substantial effort was necessary to develop computer codes
to simulate the oscillation behavior of the modeled reactors and to validate and verify these codes to ensure that
they give accurate predictions. On the basis of its review of TRACG code's qualifications for performing power oscillation
analyses, the staff concluded that TRACG can serve as an adequate tool to estimate qualitatively the global behavior
of operating reactors during transients that may result in large power oscillations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although large power oscillations may increase the overheating and severity of fuel damage resulting from an ATWS
event, the analyses indicate that core coolability and containment integrity can be acceptably maintained. Therefore,
the staff concluded that the ATWS analyses that formed the bases of the ATWS rule remain valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff's review of the advantages and disadvantages of the requirement that the recirculation pumps be tripped
indicated that recirculation pump trip was appropriate and necessary to reduce heat load to the containment following
an ATWS, and that the potentially adverse impact due to large power oscillations could be mitigated by revisions to
the Emergency Procedure Guidelines (EPGs) that were recommended by the BWROG. Revisions to the EPGs are: prompt cessation
of feedwater flow until water level is reduced to about one meter below the feedwater sparger, thus reducing core inlet
subcooling which dampens power oscillations; and earlier injection of boron in the presence of power oscillations,
thus reducing power level, which reduces the adverse consequences of any remaining power oscillations. The staff
concluded that these revisions are sufficient for mitigating the consequences of a bounding ATWS event with large
oscillations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the bases of the above analyses and recommended procedure changes, the staff concludes that, although large power
oscillations may increase the overheating and severity of fuel damage resulting from an ATWS event, core coolability
and containment integrity can be acceptably maintained in a manner consistent with the assumptions and results of
previous ATWS analyses that were the bases for the ATWS rule, and that, therefore, the requirements of the ATWS rule
remain appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because each of the issues raised in the petition has been substantively resolved, the NRC has denied this petition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In August of 1993, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking [``the 1993 NPRM''] seeking comment on
proposed rules governing the conversion of campaign funds to personal use [``the proposed rules'']. 58 FR 45463 (August
30, 1993). The proposed rules were drafted to implement section 439a of the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C.
431 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
[``FECA'']. Section 439a says that no amounts received by a candidate as contributions that are in excess of any amount
necessary to defray his or her expenditures may be converted by any person to any personal use, other than to defray
any ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with his or her duties as a holder of Federal office. Those
who wished to comment on the proposed rules were invited to do so by September 29, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission subsequently granted a request for a 45 day extension of the comment period, giving the regulated community
until November 13, 1993 to submit their views on the proposed rules. 58 FR 52040 (Oct. 6, 1993). The Commission received
32 comments from 31 commenters in response to the 1993 NPRM. The Commission also held a public hearing on January 12,
1994, at which it heard testimony from five witnesses on the proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 19, 1994, the Commission held an open meeting at which it considered draft final rules on the conversion of campaign
funds to personal use. The Commission also discussed several letters it had received at the time of the meeting requesting
an additional opportunity to comment on the rules before they are finally promulgated. These requests correctly
noted that, in an effort to address the concerns of the commenters, the draft final rules adopted a different approach
to defining personal use than the proposed rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that the 1993 NPRM sought comments on all of the areas addressed by the draft final rules. Thus,
under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it would be appropriate for the Commission to proceed to adopt final rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nevertheless, the Commission has decided to provide an additional opportunity to comment on the rules before they
are finally promulgated. The Commission has revised the rules and is publishing the revised version [referred to
as ``the revised rules''] in this NPRM in order to invite comments from the regulated community. Although this additional
comment period will delay completion of the personal use rules, the Commission still intends to finalize rules this
year. The Commission will maintan a schedule that will allow the rules to go into effect early in the next election cycle.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Revised Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised rules would include a general definition of personal use and several enumerated examples. Section 113.1(g)(1)
would indicate that, generally, personal use would be any use of funds that confers a benefit on a candidate or a member
of the candidate's family that is not related to the campaign or the ordinary and necessary duties of a holder of Federal
office. Section 113.1(g)(1)(i) contains examples of uses that would be personal use if they confer the kind of benefit
described in the general definition. The list of examples includes mortgage, rent and utility payments, certain
vehicle expenses, household food items, clothing, tuition, and funeral expenses. The list also includes salary
payments to family members in excess of fair market value, legal expenses, certain travel and meal expenses, country
club dues and entertainment. In addition, the revised rules would specifically indicate that the use of funds to pay
the candidate a salary would be personal use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 113.1(g)(1)(iii) of the revised rules would indicate that the Commission will use the general definition
to determine, on a case by case basis, whether other uses of campaign funds are personal use. The revised rules would
also indicate that the Commission may determine that a use of funds that confers a benefit on someone other than the
candidate or the candidate's family members is personal use if the benefit is not campaign or officeholder related.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revised &sect;113.1(g)(2) would indicate that charitable donations are not personal use unless the candidate making
the donation receives compensation from the recipient organization before the organization has used the funds donated
for other purposes. Under revised &sect;113.1(g)(3), transfers of campaign committee assets to the candidate would
not be personal use so long as the committee receives adequate consideration. Revised &sect;113.1(g)(3) also contains
provisions that would ensure that the cost of the asset being transferred is properly allocated between the committee
and the candidate.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;113.1(g)(4) of the revised rules, the use of funds for an expense that would be considered a political
expense under House rules or an officially connected expense under Senate rules would not be personal use to the extent
that the expense qualifies as an expenditure under 11 CFR 100.8 or is an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in
connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder. The Commission anticipates that, in most circumstances, political
and officially connected expenses will be ordinary and necessary expenses of a Federal officeholder for purposes
of the FECA, rather than conversions to personal use. However, section 439a of the FECA uses different standards than
House and Senate rules for determining whether a particular use of campaign funds is permissible. Specifically,
the Commission would not consider any use of funds that would be personal use under &sect;113.1(g)(1) to be an ordinary
and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder under the FECA. Thus, the Commission
will have to determine whether political of officially connected expenses are personal use on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed section 113.1(g)(5) of the revised rules would indicate that payments for expenses that would be personal
use under paragraph (g)(1) of this section will generally be considered contributions to the candidate if made by
a third party. Consequently, the amount donated or expended will count towards the third party's contribution limits.
However, no contribution would result if the payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund, if the funds used were
the candidate's personal funds, if the payment was made by a member of the candidate's family from an account jointly
held with the candidate, or if the payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and such payments were
made before the candidate became a candidate. Section 113.1(g)(6) would list the members of the candidate's family
for the purposes of &sect;113.1(g).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also proposing an amendment to the list of permissible uses of excess campaign funds contained in
11 CFR 113.2. The amendment would specifically indicate that certain travel costs and certain office operating expenditures
would be considered ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officeholder
under the FECA. It would also specifically indicate that any use of funds that would be personal use under 11 CFR 113.1(g)(1)
is not an ordinary and necessary expense incurred in connection with the duties of a Federal officer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice also contains a proposed conforming amendment to the definition of expenditure contained in section 100.8(b)(22).
Consistent with revised &sect;113.1(g)(5), this amendment would clarify that payment of the candidate's personal
living expenses by a member of the candidate's family will not be considered expenditures if they are made from an account
jointly held with the candidate or were paid by the family member before the candidate became a candidate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the comments on the proposed rules set out below, the Commission is interested in receiving comments
on whether additional recordkeeping and reporting requirements would be useful in administering section 439a.
Several of the commenters that responded to the 1993 NPRM expressed the view that additional reporting requirements
would be helpful in this area. However, it is difficult to craft a rule that would be both useful in enforcing the personal
use ban and not overly burdensome on the reporting committees. The Commission invites commenters to suggest ways
in which the reporting requirements could be amended to achieve this goal. Comments are also welcome on the alternative
of requiring committees to keep additional records to serve this purpose, without requiring additional reporting.
Commenters are encouraged to focus on how these amendments could be crafted to be both useful and not overly burdensome.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that Internal Revenue Service regulations under 26 U.S.C. 527 contain a definition of personal
use by political organizations. 26 CFR 1.527&hyph;5(a)(1). However, the IRS definition is not controlling in this
situation, and is not necessarily coextensive with the proposed rule. The Commission welcomes comments on the revised
rules, and on any other issues raised by this rulemaking.

to the candidate unless_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The payment is a donation to a legal expense trust fund established in accordance with the rules of the United States
Senate or the United States House of Representatives;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The payment is made from funds that are the candidate's personal funds as defined in 11 CFR 110.10(b), including
an account jointly held by the candidate and a member of the candidate's family; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The payment would have been made irrespective of the candidacy and payments for that expense were made by the
person making the payment before the candidate became a candidate. Payments that are compensation shall be considered
contributions unless_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The compensation results from bona fide employment that is genuinely independent of the candidacy;

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Short Brothers
Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. This proposal would require installation of a certain time delay relay and associated
wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. This proposal is prompted by reports of inadvertent engagements of the
rudder gust lock on in-service Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended
to prevent premature locking of the rudder gust lock, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane
in flight and during landing roll.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Short Brothers Model SD3&hyph;60 series airplanes. The CAA advises
that it has received reports of inadvertent engagements of the rudder gust lock on in-service Model SD3&hyph;60 series
airplanes. Investigation revealed that these inadvertent engagements were caused by premature locking of the rudder
gust lock system. Premature locking of the rudder gust lock, if not corrected, could result in reduced controllability
of the airplane in flight and during landing roll. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Short Brothers has issued Shorts Service Bulletin SD360&hyph;27&hyph;23, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1994, which
describes procedures for installation of a 10-second time delay relay, having part number TDD&hyph;AYOF&hyph;1002,
and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. Such an installation safeguards against inadvertent
locking of the rudder gust lock until the airplane can reach a ground speed at which the nose wheel steering can be used.
The CAA classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued CAA Airworthiness Directive 013&hyph;02&hyph;94,
dated March 24, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in the United Kingdom.

This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of a certain 10-second time delay
relay and associated wiring into a circuit of the rudder gust lock. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 88 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
29 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $140,360, or $1,595 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is proposing for comment rule and form amendments relating to the reporting of expenses by investment
companies. The proposed amendments would require an investment company to reflect as expenses in its statement of
operations certain liabilities of the company paid by broker-dealers in connection with the allocation of the company's
brokerage transactions to the broker-dealers. The amendments would also require an investment company to include
expenses paid in this manner in the fee table and financial highlights table appearing in the company's prospectus,
and in calculating the company's yield. The amendments are designed to enhance the information provided to investors
so that they may be better able to assess and compare investment company expenses and performance.

Executive Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to amend rule 6&hyph;07 of Regulation S&hyph;X, the regulation setting forth form and
content requirements for financial statements included in registration statements, proxy statements, annual
reports, and shareholder reports under the various securities laws. The amendments would require a registered investment
company (``fund'') to adjust the amount of expenses reflected in the statement of operations in its financial statements
to include amounts the fund would have paid to its service providers had a broker-dealer or any affiliate of the broker-dealer
not paid or agreed to pay those service providers on behalf of the fund in connection with the allocation of fund transactions
to the broker-dealer. The Commission is also proposing amendments to various fund registration forms to require
that the adjusted expenses be reflected in the fee table and financial highlights table included in fund prospectuses,
in the yield quotation required in fund Statements of Additional Information, and, as a result, in yield quotations
in fund advertisements and sales literature. Finally, the Commission is proposing to require that the financial
highlights table disclose the average commission rate paid by the fund.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some investment companies recently have entered into arrangements under which a broker-dealer agrees to pay the
cost of certain products or services provided to the investment company in exchange for fund brokerage (``brokerage/service
arrangements''). Under a typical brokerage/service arrangement, a broker agrees to pay a fund's custodian fees
or transfer agency fees and, in exchange, the fund agrees to direct a minimum amount of brokerage to the broker. The
fund usually negotiates the terms of the contract with the service provider, who is paid directly by the broker.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Brokerage/service arrangements are structurally similar to the more common research soft-dollar arrangements
by which an investment adviser uses client commission dollars to obtain research services. In a research soft-dollar
arrangement, however, the receipt of a benefit by an adviser through the use of its clients' commission dollars raises
conflict of interest concerns addressed by the safe harbor provisions of section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (``1934 Act''). These concerns generally are not raised by brokerage/service arrangements, which typically
involve the use of a fund's commission dollars to obtain services that directly and exclusively benefit the fund.
Nevertheless, a fund's investment adviser can benefit from these brokerage/service arrangements, particularly
if a reduction in fund expenses affects the amount of any expense waiver or reimbursement by the adviser. The receipt
by a fund's adviser of any direct or indirect economic benefit as the result of these arrangements would almost certainly
violate section 17(e)(1) of the 1940 Act [15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;17(e)(1)], unless the benefit received fell within
the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e).

A fund is currently required to disclose in footnotes to its fee table, financial highlights table, and financial
statements its participation in brokerage/service arrangements and the effect the arrangements may have on the
level of brokerage commissions paid by the fund. To the extent practicable, a fund must also quantify in these footnotes
the effect of brokerage/service arrangements on fund expenses. This footnote disclosure would no longer be necessary
if the amendments are adopted.

The safe harbor provided by section 28(e) of the 1934 Act does not encompass soft dollar arrangements under which research

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
and accompanying text, brokerage/service arrangements do not fall under the Section 28(e) safe harbor, a fund may
use principal as well as agency transactions to accumulate credits with brokers for the payment of fund expenses.
Therefore, references in this release to ``commissions'' or ``commission dollars'' rather than ``spreads'' or
``mark-ups'' are not intended to indicate otherwise.

As a result of the current accounting treatment of brokerage/service arrangements, investors may not be able to evaluate
fully the expenses of a fund that pays for services with commission dollars and accurately compare expenses and yields
among funds. This lack of comparability is particularly significant considering the wide use of fund expense data
by investors.

Under the proposed amendments, the total of the itemized expenses in the statement of operations, including the expenses
paid with commission dollars, would be shown as the fund's ``total expenses.'' As discussed below, the total expense
figure also would be used in determining the fund's expense ratio, its ``Other Expenses'' listed in the fee table,
and its yield. The total expenses would be reduced by the total amount paid with commission dollars and the remainder
shown on the statement of operations as ``net expenses.''

The additional ``cost'' reflected on the statement of operations would be the amount that the fund would have paid
for the services if commission dollars had not been used. If a fund negotiates the service provider's fees directly
with the service provider, the cost of the services for purposes of making the required adjustments would be the amount
negotiated, presumably the same amount the fund would have paid for the service in the absence of the arrangement.
When the broker arranges for the services or provides them itself or through an affiliate, however, the actual cost
of the services may not be readily determinable by the fund. In this case, the proposed amendments would require that
the fund reflect in its financial statements an amount determined by making a good-faith estimate of the amount the
fund would have paid had it contracted for the services directly in an arms-length transaction.

The amendments would specifically except research services, as that term is used in section 28(e) of the 1934 Act,
from the services the cost of which must be reflected as expenses.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The cost of research ``purchased'' by an adviser with fund commission dollars could also be considered an expense
of the fund which is not reflected as an expense in the statement of operations and other financial information. The
Commission is concerned that the adoption of these disclosure rules might lead some funds to discontinue brokerage/service
arrangements and purchase more research through traditional soft dollar arrangements, which, under these proposals,
would not be required to be treated as an expense. Comment is requested whether these proposals would have this effect.

Because research services are typically provided to the adviser, not the fund, the specific exception may be unnecessary.

The Commission is studying whether the cost of research services provided by brokers should be reflected as fund expenses
and requests comment on this issue.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters favoring inclusion of research services in the amendments should address how such services should be
valued and how the value of the services should be allocated among clients of the adviser that may benefit from them.
If research services cannot be valued, should the Commission require that assumptions be made about their value by
extrapolation from the brokerage commissions paid? For example, should the difference between a brokerage commission
paid on a transaction and the lowest commission paid by the fund be considered a fund expense for research? Alternatively,
should the Commission require only that the values of research services that have readily ascertainable values be
quantified, such as subscriptions to newspapers, price quotation or valuation services, or research that is received
in return for the direction of a determinable amount of brokerage?

2. An Alternative Accounting Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an alternative to the accounting changes being proposed, funds could be required to allocate each commission paid
between execution cost and payment for fund services and to present their financial statements based upon those allocations.
This method would require separating commissions into brokerage and expense components, and reflecting the expense
component as an expense in the financial statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The allocation method would assess the actual economic character of a fund's brokerage commissions and adjust all
fund financial information to reflect this assessment. Under the allocation method, the portion of a commission
properly allocated to expenses would have to be estimated and may need to be adjusted as the total amount of commission
dollars paid to the broker increases.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 This adjustment, in turn, would require that the cost bases and sales prices of particular securities be adjusted
periodically based upon the transactions directed to a particular broker. Therefore, using the allocation method
to account for expenses paid with commission dollars could prove to be costly and lead to undesirable uncertainties
in accounting.

B. The Fee Table and Financial Highlights Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is proposing to amend instructions to the items of the fund registration forms that require funds to
include in their prospectuses a table presenting the expenses paid by fund shareholders, either directly or out of
the assets of the fund (the ``fee table'').
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 The amended instructions would require that the expense percentages included in a fund's fee table be based upon total
expenses (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the percentages include amounts paid with commission dollars).
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, the amendments would revise Form N&hyph;1A and Form N&hyph;2 to require that the ``ratio of expenses to
average net assets'' in a fund's ``financial highlights'' table reflect expenses paid with commission dollars.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The fee table and financial highlights table are required to be placed prominently in the prospectus, and are intended
to be the primary means for the communication of fund expenses and performance to shareholders and prospective shareholders.

Unlike amounts paid with commission dollars, the amounts of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements would continue

the extent an expense is waived or reimbursed.

The proposed instructions would not require the calculation of the ``net investment income'' and ``ratio of net income
to average net assets'' entries in the financial highlights table based upon gross expenses. Net investment income
in the financial highlights table would continue to correspond to the net investment income reported in the statement
of operations.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The financial highlights table in fund prospectuses presents key financial data for each of the last ten fiscal years.
Funds may not be able to readily determine amounts paid with commission dollars during past years. Therefore, the
proposed amendments would not require that total expenses be reflected in the expense ratio in the financial highlights
table for fiscal years ending before the adoption of the amendments.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 A footnote would be required disclosing the change in the manner in which expenses have been determined.

If these proposals are adopted, the Commission may require funds to present the grossed-up expense information in
statements of operations and financial highlights tables for the entire fiscal period ending on or after the date
of adoption. Because funds ordinarily would maintain records related to these arrangements, this should not be burdensome.
Comment is requested whether reflecting total expenses for the period beginning before adoption of the rule would
be burdensome.

C. Performance Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commission rules require that any quotation of yield in a mutual fund advertisement be calculated in accordance with
a formula that reflects fund expenses accrued for the period.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Use of total expenses in the calculation of a fund's yield may be appropriate to reflect actual fund expenses and necessary
to maintain the value of yield as an indicator of fund performance.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the Commission is proposing instructions to the yield formulas for funds (other than money market funds)
to require that the costs of services paid for with brokerage commissions be reflected in quotations of yield in a fund's
registration statement, and, as a result, in its advertisements.

no amendment to the total return formula is being proposed.

As discussed above, the proposed amendments to Regulation S&hyph;X would require that adjustments to fund expenses
be made at the end of a financial statement period.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Those amendments generally would not require funds to accrue or otherwise determine at the end of the thirty-day period
for which yield is calculated the amount of expenses paid with brokerage commissions for that period. The proposed
instructions to the yield formulas, therefore, would require funds to estimate amounts paid with commission dollars
for the period of the yield quotation. Comment is requested on the feasibility of making such an estimate and whether
there are alternative approaches.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals would not revise the manner in which yield is calculated by money market funds. The money market fund
yield formula is based upon the net change in the value of a hypothetical account, and any spread or mark-up paid by a
fund would be amortized and reflected in that change in value.
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, requiring money market funds to include fees paid with commission dollars in the calculation of yield
would result in those fees being counted twice.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is specifically requested whether the money market fund yield formula should be revised to reflect the cost
of services paid for with commission dollars as expenses when they are incurred. Commenters should discuss the extent
to which money market funds pay or can pay expenses through brokerage/service arrangements, and commenters suggesting
revisions to the yield calculation should provide specific text or formulas.

The same double-counting problem does not arise with respect to non-money market funds because the yield formula
for those funds generally requires that the amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities
be based upon the market value of the security, rather than the initial purchase price. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Instruction 1(a) to Item 22(b)(ii) of Form N&hyph;1A. The mark-up or spread paid by the fund upon the purchase of a security
is not reflected in the security's market value and therefore would not be a part of any premium amortized or discount
accreted for the purposes of calculating yield.

D. Related Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is aware that funds enter into certain other arrangements that, like brokerage/service arrangements,
have the effect of reducing reported fund expenses. Some funds, for example, have ``compensating balance'' arrangements
with their custodians under which their custodian fees are reduced if they maintain cash on deposit with the custodians
in non-interest bearing accounts. In these arrangements expenses are reduced by forgoing income rather than by recharacterizing
them as capital items. The Commission requests comment whether an adjustment to fund expenses similar to that being
proposed for brokerage/service arrangements should be required for these expense offset arrangements, or whether
these arrangements should be addressed in footnotes to the financial statements. Because a fund that enters into
these arrangements forgoes income, comment also is requested whether such income should be estimated and reflected
in fund financial information, and how such estimates might be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some custodial arrangements may involve explicit oral or written understandings regarding the fee reductions that
will occur when uninvested cash balances exceed predetermined levels. Often, however, a fund's custodian fee reflects
an estimate of the income the custodian expects to derive from the fund's uninvested cash balances, and the resulting
reduction in the fee is not explicitly disclosed in the custodial agreement. The Commission requests comment whether
the amount of any increase in fund expenses to reflect these arrangements should include only amounts that are explicit
in the agreements, or should also include amounts implicit in the basic custodian fee.

E. Average Commission Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brokerage commissions and other costs incurred in connection with the execution of a fund's portfolio transactions
are not reflected in the fund's statement of operations, financial highlights table or fee table because these costs
are treated as capital items which increase the cost of securities purchased or reduce the proceeds of securities
sold. The Commission is concerned that adequate information about these costs currently may not be provided to investors.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission, therefore, is proposing to require that the average commission rate paid by a fund (in cents per share)
be disclosed in the financial highlights table next to the portfolio turnover rate.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Other fund transaction costs, such as mark-ups, mark-downs, and spreads, would not be included in this commission
rate figure. Comment is requested whether these other costs should be reflected, and, if so, how they should be calculated
or estimated.

Any interested persons wishing to submit written comments on the rule and form changes that are the subject of this
Release, to suggest additional changes, or to submit comments on other matters that might have an effect on the proposals
contained in this Release, are requested to do so. Comment is specifically requested regarding the prevalence and
significant terms of brokerage/service arrangements, the expenses paid through the arrangements, and the effect
of the arrangements on fund expenses and commissions.

The rule and form changes proposed today are intended to improve the reporting of investment company expenses and
improve the ability of investors to compare investment company expenses and performance. While the rule and form
changes may increase the costs to funds of preparing financial statements and fund registration materials, the Commission
believes that any such cost increases would, at most, be minimal. A fund that has brokerage/service arrangements
would be required to add two captions and a footnote to its statement of operations and replace the net expense figures
currently disclosed in its fee table and financial highlights table with total expense figures. These figures will
normally be readily determinable by the fund. Funds should also be able to readily estimate expenses paid with brokerage
commissions for purposes of yield calculations. In short, the Commission believes that the costs of the amendments
proposed today would be substantially outweighed by the benefits to investors of receiving more accurate and useful
financial information about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
funds.

The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding
the proposed amendments. The analysis notes that the rule and form proposals contained in this Release are intended
to provide for the comparability of fund expenses reflected in fund disclosure documents and advertisements. Other
aggregate cost-benefit information reflected in the ``Cost/Benefit Analysis'' section of this release also is
reflected in the analysis. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained by contacting Eric
C. Freed, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, Washington, DC 20549.

1994 (58 FR 28821, 28822), FDA issued two documents entitled ``Review of General Biologics and Licensing Regulations''
(Docket No. 94N&hyph;0066) and ``Review of Regulations for Blood Establishments and Blood Products'' (Docket No.
94N&hyph;0080). Interested persons were given until August 17, 1994, to respond to the documents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American Blood Resources Association has requested a 90-day extension of the comment periods for the two above
mentioned documents. The Biotechnology Industry Organization and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America have requested a 60-day extension for the general biologics and licensing regulations document. In order
to allow interested persons to fully respond to the requests for comments, FDA believes it is in the public interest
to extend the comment period to allow interested persons to carefully review the regulations and submit written comments.
Therefore, FDA is granting the request by extending the comment periods for both documents to November 15, 1994. Interested
persons may, on or before November 15, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above).
Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified
with the appropriate docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen
in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 19, 1994, MSHA published a proposed rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 26356) revising stayed provisions of MSHA's existing safety standards for ventilation of underground coal
mines. The proposal also revised, clarified or reproposed certain other provisions in the existing rule; included
some new provisions; and addressed concerns raised by the public. The comment period was scheduled to close on July
18, 1994, but, in response to a request from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mining community for additional time in which to prepare comments, MSHA extended the comment period to August 8, 1994
(59 FR 35071). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the hearings is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions interpreting or clarifying the
proposal. The hearings will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA officials. Although formal rules
of evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly
progress of the hearings and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each session will begin with an opening statement from MSHA, followed by an opportunity for members of the public to
make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion of
the presiding official, the time allocated to speakers for their presentations may be limited. In the interest of
conducting productive hearings, MSHA will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view to be heard
as effectively as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing
transcripts will be made available to the public for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSHA will also accept for the record additional written comments and other appropriate data from any interested party,
including those not presenting oral statements. Written comments and data submitted to MSHA will be included in the
rulemaking record. To allow for the submission of any post-hearing comments the record will remain open until November
18, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia for the
purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance
Program. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this action should do so at this time.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing to update a portion of the Outer Continental Shelf (``OCS'') Air Regulations. Requirements applying
to OCS sources located within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries must be updated periodically to remain consistent
with the requirements of the corresponding onshore area (``COA''), as mandated by section 328(a)(1) of the Clean
Air Act (``the Act''), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The portion of the OCS air regulations that is being updated
pertains to the requirements for OCS sources for which the Santa Barbara County Air Pollution Control District (Santa
Barbara County APCD) and the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD) are the designated
COAs, and a requirement submitted by the state of California. The OCS requirements for the above Districts and the
state of California, contained in the Technical Support Document, are proposed to be incorporated by reference into
the Code of Federal Regulations and are listed in the appendix to the OCS air regulations. Proposed changes to the existing
requirements are discussed below.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 4, 1992, EPA promulgated 40 CFR part 55,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 which established requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources in order to attain and maintain federal
and state ambient air quality standards and to comply with the provisions of part C of title I of the Act. Part 55 applies
to all OCS sources offshore of the States except those located in the Gulf of Mexico west of 87.5 degrees longitude.
Section 328 of the Act requires that for such sources located within 25 miles of a state's seaward boundary, the requirements
shall be the same as would be applicable if the sources were located in the COA. Because the OCS requirements are based
on onshore requirements, and onshore requirements may change, section 328(a)(1) requires that EPA update the OCS
requirements as necessary to maintain consistency with onshore requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The reader may refer to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, December 5, 1991 (56 FR 63774), and the preamble to the final
rule promulgated September 4, 1992 (57 FR 40792) for further background and information on the OCS regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to &sect;55.12 of the OCS rule, consistency reviews will occur: (1) At least annually; (2) upon receipt of
a Notice of Intent (NOI) under &sect;55.4; and (3) when a state or local agency submits a rule to EPA to be considered
for incorporation by reference in part 55. This NPRM is being promulgated in response to the submittal of rules by two
local air pollution control agencies and one rule submitted by the state of California. Public comments received
in writing within 30 days of publication of this notice will be considered by EPA before promulgation of the final updated
rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 328(a) of the Act requires that EPA establish requirements to control air pollution from OCS sources located
within 25 miles of states' seaward boundaries that are the same as onshore requirements. To comply with this statutory
mandate, EPA must incorporate applicable onshore rules into part 55 as they exist onshore. This limits EPA's flexibility
in deciding which requirements will be incorporated into part 55 and prevents EPA from making substantive changes
to the requirements it incorporates. As a result, EPA may be incorporating rules into part 55 that do not conform to
all of EPA's state implementation plan (SIP) guidance or certain requirements of the Act. Consistency updates may
result in the inclusion of state or local rules or regulations into part 55, even though the same rules may ultimately
be disapproved for inclusion as part of the SIP. Inclusion in the OCS rule does not imply that a rule meets the requirements
of the Act for SIP approval, nor does it imply that the rule will be approved by EPA for inclusion in the SIP.

EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In updating 40 CFR part 55, EPA reviewed the state and local rules submitted for inclusion in part 55 to ensure that they
are rationally related to the attainment or maintenance of federal or state ambient air quality standards or part
C of title I of the Act, that they are not designed expressly to prevent exploration and development of the OCS and that
they are applicable to OCS sources. 40 CFR 55.1. EPA has also evaluated the rules to ensure they are not arbitrary or
capricious. 40 CFR 55.12 (e). In addition, EPA has excluded administrative or procedural rules.

Upon delegation the onshore area will use its administrative and procedural rules as onshore. In those instances
where EPA does not delegate authority to implement and enforce part 55, EPA will use its own administrative and procedural
requirements to implement the substantive requirements. 40 CFR 55.14(c)(4).

A. As stated in the California Health and Safety Code, the following requirements shall be statewide, and no rule or
regulation of any district that is applicable to sandblasting operations shall be stricter or less strict than the
standards adopted by the state board pursuant to the recommendations of the committee appointed by the state board
to adopt air pollution standards for sandblasting operations. After review of the rule submitted by the State of California
against the criteria set forth above and in 40 CFR part 55, EPA is proposing to make the state abrasive sandblasting
requirements applicable to OCS sources:

D. Regulatory Flexibility Act_The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires each federal agency to perform a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to have a ``significant impact on a substantial number of small
entities.'' Small entities include small businesses, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organizations, and governmental jurisdictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was stated in the final regulation, the OCS rule does not apply to any small entities, and the structure of the rule
averts direct impacts and mitigates indirect impacts on small entities. This consistency update merely incorporates
onshore requirements into the OCS rule to maintain consistency with onshore regulations as required by section 328
of the Act and does not alter the structure of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Paperwork Reduction Act_The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements
contained in the final OCS rulemaking dated September 4, 1992 under the provisions of the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USEPA proposes to redesignate Oshkosh, Wisconsin from unclassifiable to attainment status for carbon monoxide.
In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the redesignation as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial redesignation and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to the direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If the USEPA receives adverse comments, the direct final
rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting
on this document should do so at this time.

, EPA is announcing a three-month stay and reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks
in industrial process equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program. That action
stays the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), including the applicable compliance dates, as they apply to industrial
process refrigeration equipment only. EPA is issuing that stay pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42
U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), which provides the Administrator authority to stay the effectiveness of a rule during reconsideration.

This notice proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), to stay temporarily the
effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i), and applicable compliance dates, beyond the three months expressly provided
in section 307(d)(7)(B), but only to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration (including any appropriate
regulatory action) of the rules in question. Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forth in the Clean Air Act section 307(d), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d), EPA hereby requests public comment on this proposed temporary
extension of the three-month stay.

, EPA announces that pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(7)(B), it is convening a proceeding
for reconsideration of certain federal rules requiring the repair of leaks of ozone-depleting substances for industrial
process refrigeration equipment promulgated as part of the National Refrigerant Recycling Program (58

28660, May 14, 1993). Readers should refer to that notice for a complete discussion of the background and rules affected.
In that document EPA also announces a three-month stay of &sect;82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration
equipment only, and any applicable compliance dates, during reconsideration (including appropriate regulatory
action) expressly provided by the Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). If EPA does not complete the reconsideration
during the three-month stay, then it may be appropriate to extend the stay of these provisions for industrial process
refrigeration and applicable compliance dates until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration.
By this action, EPA proposes a temporary extension of the stay beyond the three months to the extent necessary to complete
reconsideration of the rules in question. If EPA takes final action to impose this proposed stay, the stay would extend
until the effective date of EPA's final action following reconsideration of these rules.

By this notice EPA hereby proposes, pursuant to Clean Air Act sections 301(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. 7601(a)(1), a temporary
administrative stay of the effectiveness of 40 CFR 82.156(i) as it applies to industrial process refrigeration equipment,
including the applicable compliance dates, promulgated as final federal rules requiring the repair and/or retrofitting
of equipment containing ozone-depleting refrigerants (58

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28660, May 14, 1993). Pursuant to the rulemaking procedures set forth in section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, EPA hereby
requests comment on such a proposed stay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing this temporary administrative stay of the rules and associated compliance dates in order to complete
reconsideration of these rules, EPA intends to complete its reconsideration of the rules and, following the notice
and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, take appropriate action. If the reconsideration results
in repair and retrofit requirements for industrial process refrigeration equipment that are stricter than the existing
and rules, EPA intends to propose an appropriate compliance period from the date of final action on reconsideration.
EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA
proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate compliance period would be subject
to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FRA proposes to establish a Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990
and the Federal Advisory Committee Act to develop a recommended rule concerning the protection of railroad roadway
workers. The Committee would adopt its recommendations through a negotiation process. The Committee would be composed
of persons who represent the interests affected by the rule, such as labor organizations, railroads, railroad associations,
contractor associations, and the government. FRA invites interested parties to submit nominations and applications
for membership on the Committee.

(A) History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act, Pub.L. No. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
102&hyph;365, 106 Stat. 972, enacted September 3, 1992, required FRA to review its track safety standards and revise
them based on data presented during that review. Among the topics to be addressed was ``an evaluation of employee safety.''
FRA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on November 16, 1992 (57 FR 54038) to announce the opening
of a proceeding to amend the Federal Track Safety Standards (49 CFR Part 213). That ANPRM addressed the general topics
to be considered, including standards for railroad track itself, and protecting maintenance-of-way and other non-operating
railroad employees from the hazards of moving railroad equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of that proceeding, FRA conducted a series of workshops to obtain the industry's views on the need for and substance
of any changes to FRA's regulations. One such workshop session, announced in Notice No. 4 of that ANPRM issued on February
18, 1993 (58 FR 8928), and held in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1993 addressed specifically the issue of protection
of roadway workers from being struck by moving trains and equipment. Since that workshop, FRA has received petitions
for emergency orders and rulemaking on the topic from the Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employees and the Brotherhood
of Railroad Signalmen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA originally planned to include protection from moving trains and moving equipment into a new Subpart G of 49 CFR
Part 213, but it will now be considered as part of 49 CFR Part 214, Railroad Workplace Safety. Given FRA's desire to address
this issue on an expedited basis, and because it relates more closely to workplace safety than to track standards,
this proceeding is now separated from FRA Docket No. RST&hyph;90&hyph;1 and has been placed in FRA Docket No. RSOR
13. Items related to this subject which were submitted as part of Docket No. RST&hyph;90&hyph;1 will be considered
as part of this proceeding, as will the transcript of the public workshop on March 31, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
(B) Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FRA is taking this action for the purpose of reducing the risk of death or injury railroad roadway workers face when
struck by moving trains and railroad equipment. Since 1989, 21 roadway workers have been fatally injured by moving
trains and equipment. Eight workers were struck by trains while performing work, three were struck by trains on track
adjacent to the work location, five stepped into a train's path, and five were struck by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance-of-way equipment. These fatalities are among the following crafts: signal maintainers, machine operators,
welders, track foremen, track inspectors, and track laborers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These figures reflect a serious problem that may require changes in railroad operating rules, training and practices.
In order to address the problem in the short term, FRA Administrator Molitoris convened a meeting on June 3, 1994 at
which FRA distributed summaries of the fatalities, and enlisted the support of the industry to address the issue immediately
on each railroad through local labor/management committees. FRA also discussed the option of proceeding with a negotiated
rulemaking, and has since preliminarily concluded that this issue is an appropriate subject for negotiated rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
(C) Terminology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FRA proposes that the term ``roadway worker'' rather than ``maintenance of way employee'' be used in this proceeding
to define the subject persons. This term would encompass all employees of a railroad or a contractor to a railroad who
construct, maintain, inspect or repair railroad tracks, structures, signal and train control systems, communication
systems, utility systems, or any other fixed property of a railroad while in close or potentially close proximity
to tracks on which trains or equipment can be operated. The term would apply regardless of the craft or class title of
the employee, affiliation with any labor organization, or rank within the railroad organization. Examples of subject
persons would be trackmen, signal maintainers, bridge workers, communication technicians, electricians, surveyors,
roadmasters and chief engineers, while performing their duties along the line of road. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA believes that extensive input from all interested parties is necessary to develop a rule that will address both
the risk of injury from moving railroad equipment and the operational concerns that this issue presents. Therefore,
this notice announces FRA's proposal to address these issues through a negotiated rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Set forth below are the basic concepts of negotiated rulemaking, suggested procedures to be followed, and criteria
for participant selection. In order to begin this process shortly, FRA asks that parties representing interests
affected by a roadway worker safety rule request appointment or representation on the Committee within thirty days
of publication of this notice.

II. Regulatory Negotiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Due to the increasing complexity and formalization of the written rulemaking process, it can be difficult for an agency
to craft effective regulatory solutions to certain problems. In the typical rulemaking process, the participants
often develop adversarial relationships that prevent effective communication and creative solutions. The exchange
of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to all interested groups often does not occur in the traditional notice
and comment system. As the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) noted in its Recommendation 82&hyph;4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
Experience indicates that if the parties in interest were to work together to negotiate the text of a proposed rule,
they might be able in some circumstances to identify the major issues, gauge their importance to the respective parties,
identify the information and data necessary to resolve the issues, and develop a rule that is acceptable to the respective
interests, all within the contours of the substantive statute.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ACUS adopted this recommendation in ``Procedures for Negotiating Proposed Regulations,'' 47 FR 30708, June 18,
1982. The thrust of the recommendation is that representatives of all interests should be assembled to discuss the
issue or hazard and all potential solutions, reach consensus, and prepare a proposed rule for consideration by the
agency. After public comment on any proposal issued by the agency, the group would reconvene to review the comments
and make recommendations for a final rule. This inclusive process is intended to make the rule more acceptable to all
affected interests and prevent the need for petitions for reconsideration and litigation that often follow promulgation
of a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The movement toward negotiated rulemaking gained impetus with enactment of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990
(Reg-Neg), 5 U.S.C. &sect;561, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
More recently, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 (EO) (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), which states the
need to reform the current regulatory process into one that is effective, consistent, and understandable. The objectives
of the EO are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To reaffirm the primacy of Federal agencies in the regulatory decision-making process; to restore the integrity
and legitimacy of regulatory review and oversight; and to make the process more accessible and open to the public.

Section 6(a) of the EO charges government agencies with providing the public meaningful participation in the regulatory
process:

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In particular, before issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, each agency should, where appropriate, seek the involvement
of those who are intended to benefit from and those expected to be burdened by any regulation . . . Each agency is also
directed to explore and, where appropriate, use consensual mechanisms for developing regulations, including negotiated
rulemaking.

Although relatively new, negotiated rulemakings have been used successfully by many regulatory agencies, including
the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration. FRA now intends to begin this process in a formalized manner for the
first time, and does so with enthusiasm and high expectations. FRA welcomes the opportunity to work with those who
will be affected directly by a roadway worker safety rule, and is confident that the agency and the industry will benefit
from the process by creating an effective and reasonable regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 563(a) of Reg-Neg, an agency considering rulemaking by negotiation should consider whether:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) There is a need for the rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There is a limited number of identifiable interests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) These interests can be adequately represented by persons willing to negotiate in good faith to reach a consensus;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) There is a reasonable likelihood that the committee will reach consensus within a fixed period of time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The negotiated rulemaking procedure will not unreasonably delay the notice of proposed rulemaking; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) the agency has adequate resources and is willing to commit such resources to the process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) The agency is committed to use the result of the negotiation in formulating a proposed rule if at all possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated in this Notice, FRA believes that these criteria have been met with respect to railroad roadway
safety issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulatory negotiation FRA proposes would be carried out by an advisory committee (Committee) created under
the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. App., and in a manner that reflects appropriate rulemaking
objectives, including pertinent Executive Orders. FRA will be represented on the Committee and will take an active
part in the negotiations as a Committee member. However, pursuant to section 566(c) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reg-Neg, the person(s) designated to represent FRA would not facilitate or otherwise chair the proceedings. The
agency is committed to this process and is quite optimistic that it will result in the issuance of an NPRM and final rule
that will be acceptable to the members of the Committee. Because of the need to issue a rule on this subject, FRA is prepared
to go forward with an NPRM that is not the product of the negotiations in the unlikely event the negotiation fails or
if the Committee's recommendation is not acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Procedures and Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following proposed procedures and guidelines would apply to this process, subject to appropriate changes made
as a result of comments received on this Notice or as are determined to be necessary during the negotiating process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Facilitator: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA is seeking the services of a facilitator for the negotiating group. The facilitator will not be involved with substantive
development of this regulation. This individual will chair the negotiations, may offer alternative suggestions
toward the desired consensus, will help participants define and reach consensus, and will determine the feasibility
of negotiating particular issues. The facilitator may ask members to submit additional information or to reconsider
their position. FRA will contact mediation organizations for potential candidates, and will consider nominations
made in comments received in response to this Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Feasibility: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has examined the issues and interests involved and has made a preliminary inquiry among representatives of those
interests to determine whether it is possible to reach agreement on: (a) individuals to represent those interests;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the preliminary scope of the issues to be addressed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) a schedule for developing a notice of proposed rulemaking. On the basis of the history of this issue and our preliminary
inquiry, we believe that regulatory negotiation could be successful in developing a workable proposal for a notice
of proposed rulemaking and a final rule, and that the potential participants listed below would adequately represent
the affected interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Participants and Interests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The number of committee participants generally should not exceed 25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Please note that each individual or organization affected by a final rule need not have its own representative on the
Committee. Rather, each interest must be adequately represented, and the Committee should be fairly balanced. Individuals
who are not part of the Committee may attend sessions and confer with or provide their views to Committee members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following interests have been tentatively identified as those that are likely to be significantly affected by
the rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Railroad labor organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Railroads, including classes 1 through 3, the short lines, public transit operations, and their associations;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Contractors to railroads who perform roadway work; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Federal government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA proposes that persons selected by the various interests be named to the Committee. The following interests have
been tentatively identified as those that would supply Committee members: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Brotherhood of Maintenance-of-Way Employes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The American Train Dispatchers Association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Association of American Railroads; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The American Short Line Railroad Association; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) American Public Transit Association; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) FRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in paragraph F of this notice, FRA invites applications for representation from any interests that will
be affected by a rule, but are not named in this list. FRA is committed to an open and comprehensive negotiation, and
therefore strongly encourages any such party to file an application for membership. These applications may come
from railroads, labor organizations, associations, or other interests, must be filed within thirty days, and must
meet the requirements set forth in this notice. Also, the interests listed above and those who apply for representation
on the Committee should provide the name(s) of the individual(s) they propose to represent their interests. The Committee
should not exceed twenty-five members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Good Faith: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants must be committed to negotiate in good faith. It is therefore important that senior individuals within
each interest group be designated to represent that interest. No individual will be required to ``bind'' the interests
he or she represents, but the individual should be at a high enough level to represent the interest with confidence.
For this process to be successful, the interests represented should be willing to accept the final Committee product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Intent to Establish Advisory Committee and Request for Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the requirements of FACA, an agency of the Federal government cannot establish or utilize a group
of people in the interest of obtaining consensus advice or recommendations unless that group is chartered as a Federal
advisory committee. It is the purpose of this Notice to indicate our intent to create a Federal advisory committee,
to identify the issues involved in the rulemaking, to identify the interests affected by the rulemaking, to identify
potential participants who will adequately represent those interests, and to ask for comment on the use of regulatory
negotiation and on the identification of the issues, interests, procedures, and participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requests for Representation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One purpose of this Notice is to determine whether interests exist that may be substantially affected by a rule, but
have not been represented in the list of prospective Committee members. Please identify such interests if they exist.
Each application for membership or nomination to the Committee should include: (i) the name of the applicant or nominee
and the interests such person would represent; (ii) evidence that the applicant or nominee is authorized to represent
parties related to the interests the person proposes to represent; (iii) a written commitment that the applicant
or nominee would participate in good faith; and (iv) the reasons any representative identified in the Notice does
not represent the interests the nominee is alleged to represent. If an additional person or interest requests membership
or representation on the Committee, FRA shall determine (i) whether that interest will be substantially affected
by the rule, (ii) if such interest would be adequately represented by an individual already on the Committee, and (iii)
whether the requester should be added to the group or whether interests can be consolidated to provide adequate representation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Notice: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After evaluating comments received as a result of this notice, FRA will issue a final notice announcing the establishment
of the Federal advisory committee, unless it determines that such action is inappropriate in light of comments received,
and the composition of the Committee. After the Committee is chartered the negotiations would begin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative Support and Meetings: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Staff support would be provided by FRA and meetings would take place in Washington, D.C., unless agreed otherwise
by the Committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tentative Schedule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the Committee is established and selected, FRA will publish a schedule for the first meeting in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The first meeting will focus on procedural matters, including dates, times, and locations of future meetings. Notice
of subsequent meetings would also be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 before being held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA expects that the Committee would reach consensus and prepare a report recommending a proposed rule within six
months of the first meeting. However, if unforeseen delays occur, the Administrator may agree to an extension of that
time if a consensus of the Committee believes that additional time will result in agreement. The process may end earlier
if the facilitator so recommends. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(J) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Committee Procedures: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the general guidance of the facilitator, and subject to legal requirements, the Committee would establish
the detailed procedures for meetings which it considers appropriate.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Record of Meetings: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with FACA's requirements, FRA would keep a record of all Committee meetings. This record would be placed
in the public docket for this rulemaking. Meetings of the Committee would generally be open to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(L) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consensus: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of the negotiating process is consensus. FRA proposes that the Committee would develop its own definition
of consensus, which may include unanimity, a simple majority, or substantial agreement such that no member will disapprove
the final recommendation of the Committee. However, if the Committee does not develop its own definition, consensus
shall be unanimous concurrence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(M)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Final Rule: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee's first objective is to prepare a report containing a notice of proposed rulemaking, preamble, and
economic evalutation. If consensus is not obtained on some issues, the report should identify the areas of agreement
and disagreement, and explanations for any disagreement. It is expected that participants will address cost/benefit,
paperwork reduction, and regulatory flexibility requirements. FRA would prepare an economic assessment if appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA would issue the proposed rule as prepared by the Committee unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority
of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's view, adequately address the subject matter.
If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would modify the proposal in a way that allows the
public to distinguish modifications from the original proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee would reconvene to review comments received in response to publication of the proposed rule and would
negotiate to produce a recommended final rule. FRA would issue the recommended final rule as prepared by the Committee
unless it is inconsistent with statutory authority of the agency or other legal requirements or does not, in the agency's
view, adequately address the subject matter. If that occurs, FRA would explain the reasons for its decision, or would
modify the recommended final rule in a way that allows the public to distinguish modifications from the recommended
final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Key Issues for Negotiation: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA has reviewed correspondence, petitions, injury data, existing railroad operating practices, and has engaged
in extensive dialogue concerning the protection of roadway workers. Based on this information and rulemaking requirements,
FRA has tentatively identified major issues that should be considered in this negotiated rulemaking. Other issues
related to roadway protection not specifically listed in this Notice may be addressed as they arise in the course of
the negotiation. Comments are invited concerning the appropriateness of these issues for consideration and whether
other issues should be added.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Are devices available that may be used to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so, how do these devices
work and what are the costs associated with them? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Are there appropriate procedures or operating practices that may be instituted effectively to reduce the risk
of danger to roadway workers? If so, what are the costs that will be associated with implementing these practices and
procedures? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Are there appropriate training programs that may be given to reduce the risk of danger to roadway workers? If so,
at what intervals should they be taught? Also, what are the costs and the time associated with such a program? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Are there peculiar topographical, environmental, and operational conditions that must be considered in developing
a program to reduce the risk of harm to roadway workers? What are the specific conditions, and how do they vary from one
region to another, and from one railroad to another? What would the cost for this program be? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Should any program developed vary according to the size of a railroad? If so, explain why such variations are necessary
and how the programs should differ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. What recordkeeping and reporting requirements, if any, should be instituted to advance the safety of roadway workers?
What is the amount of time and cost involved with these requirements? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. What enforcement procedures should FRA utilize to ensure compliance with any rule developed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Aside from the obvious benefit of providing safer working conditions and so reducing the risk of injury and death
for roadway workers, are there additional benefits (both monetary and non-monetary) that will result from the implementation
of a rule concerning roadway workers? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Do any railroads currently have internal operating practices that address the intended purposes of this negotiated
rulemaking? If so, please provide the background for implementation of these practices, and a description of their
effectiveness. Also, what were the costs and benefits associated with implementing these practices?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service
make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding
is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Service determines that the subject petition did not present substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 10, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the scaled dune Buprestid beetle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepismadora algodones
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species. The petition was submitted by Dr. Charles Bellamy of Escondido, California and was dated
August 5, 1992. The petition stated that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. algodones
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is imperiled because its current distribution is small, its population size is low, and its habitat is being depleted
and degraded by off-highway vehicles (OHVs).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The scaled dune buprestid beetle was first collected in 1985 along the western edge of the Algodones Sand Hills, near
Glamis, Imperial County, California (Bellamy 1992). The beetle was first described in 1987 by R.K. Velten (Velten
and Bellamy 1987). It is quite distinct from other buprestids in North America (Bellamy 1992). The species has been
collected from its type locality every year since 1985.

The scaled dune buprestid beetle occupies ecotonal vegetation between Sonoran creosote bush scrub and southern
dune scrub along the perimeter of the Algodones Sand Hills, an area of extensive sand dunes approximately 45 miles
(70 kilometers) in length. Dominant shrubs in this habitat include

 (creosote), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

 sp., and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eriogonum deserticola
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Imperial buckwheat). A variety of perennial herbs as also present in this habitat. Adult beetles have been observed
feeding on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiquila plicata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (plicate coldenia), but no information is available on larval hosts or the species' population biology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Land Management owns the lands supporting the beetle. Portions of the Algodones Sand Hills are heavily
used by OHVs and are completely denuded of vegetation. A large portion of the sand hills are closed to OHV use, and much
of the open section of the dunes are unaffected by OHVs, because the area is not easily accessible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Bellamy (pers. comm. 1992) suggested that the scaled dune buprestid is restricted to a single large colony, located
in the closed portion of the dunes. He acknowledge that seemingly suitable habitat exists along the perimeter of the
Algodones Sand Hills. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tiquila plicata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, an adult food plant, is common along the perimeter of the dunes. Dr. Bellamy indicated that much of the area has not
been surveyed because it is inaccessible without using OHVs, which would potentially damage the species habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully reviewed the petition and interviewed Dr. Bellamy. Based upon this information, the Service
has determined that substantial information has not been presented indicating that the listing of the scaled dune
buprestid may be warranted. This finding is based upon a lack of data for the vast majority of apparently suitable habitat,
coupled with a lack of documentation of threats facing this species.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) that prescribe the certification and training
requirements for mechanics and repairmen. Current regulations prescribing these certification requirements
do not reflect the significant technological advances that have occurred in the aviation industry and the enhancements
in training and instructional methods that have affected all aviation maintenance personnel. The proposed rule
would consolidate and clarify all certification, training, experience, and currency requirements for aviation
maintenance personnel in a newly established Part 66 of the FAR. The proposal would enhance aviation safety by establishing
new training programs for aviation maintenance personnel and would decrease the regulatory burden on these personnel
by providing alternatives for meeting experience and currency requirements. The proposed rule would enhance the
technical capabilities and increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. All proposals
are based on recommendations developed by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC).

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In keeping with the FAA's policy of reviewing and upgrading regulations to ensure that they are consistent with changes
in the aviation environment, the FAA is conducting a two-phase regulatory review to amend Part 65, Subparts D and E
(14 CFR Part 65) of the FAR, which pertain to mechanics, mechanics holding inspection authorizations, and repairmen.
Since the recodification requirements for these airmen has not been accomplished and few significant revisions
to the subparts have been made. However, numerous technological advances in the aviation industry, recent FAA and
international regulatory activities, concerns over aging aircraft, and enhancements in training methods have
significantly affected all aspects of maintenance operations. Additionally, various and often conflicting interpretations
of the existing regulations periodically have resulted in confusion among the airmen for whom this part was intended.
Because of these factors, the FAA has instituted this complete regulatory review of Part 65, Subparts D and E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In November 1989, a joint industry/FAA Part 65 review group was formed to evaluate and review certification requirements
for mechanics and repairmen. The review group's objective was to develop and present a unified position on Part 65.
The group comprised representatives from several aviation associations and was coordinated by the Professional
Aviation Maintenance Association (PAMA). FAA interests were represented by the Aircraft Maintenance Division
(AFS&hyph;300) of the FAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The review group conducted a series of panel discussions throughout the United States and, as a result, drafted the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Industry/FAA Part 65 Review Group Working Paper, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which was published on January 31, 1991. This paper presented the issues of general agreement within the review group
and also presented those issues that the group believed would require further discussion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further impetus for the Part 65 review came with ARAC's establishment. The ARAC charter became effective on February
5, 1991. ARAC was established to assist the FAA in the rulemaking process by providing input from outside the Government
on major regulatory issues affecting aviation safety. ARAC includes representatives of air carriers, manufacturers,
general aviation, labor groups, universities, associations, airline passenger groups, and the general public.
Under the framework provided by ARAC, the previously established Part 65 review group became a working group of ARAC.
ARAC's formation has given the FAA additional opportunities to solicit information directly from significantly
affected parties who meet and exchange ideas about proposed rules and existing rules that should either be revised
or eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues agreed upon by the review group in the January 31, 1991, working paper and the consensus achieved at subsequent
meetings of the Part 65 working group have become the basis for the changes proposed in this NPRM, which constitute
phase I of the Part 65 regulatory review. The issues that require further discussion and agreement by the members of
the working group (such as the evaluation of any potential for additional certificates and ratings and the expansion
of aviation repair specialist privileges) will become the basis for phase II of the regulatory review and a subsequent
NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of this regulatory review, the FAA completed a historical review of Part 65, Subparts D and E, on October
22, 1991. This review revealed that there have been 17 amendments (1 of which was rescinded), 3 petitions for rulemaking,
and 100 exemption actions to these subparts since recodification. In addition, one accident, the Aloha Airlines
Boeing 737 structural failure on April 28, 1988, generated National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendations
related to these subparts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three petitions for rulemaking addressed issues associated with establishing certificates and ratings for
avionics and instrument technicians, recertifying mechanics, and allowing applicants for mechanic certificates
who desire to qualify on the basis of experience and have not graduated from an approved Part 147 aviation maintenance
technician school to take the oral and practical tests for a certificate or rating before completing the required
written tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The majority of requests for exemption, FAA policy letters, and legal interpretations regarding mechanics pertained
to inspection authorization renewal or the general eligibility and experience requirements. The majority of actions
concerning repairmen involved certificate privileges and limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also conducted a survey of FAA regional offices on the certification of mechanics, holders of inspection authorizations,
and repairmen during 1991. A copy of this survey has been placed in docket number 27863. The survey questions were derived
from issues that surfaced during FAA participation in listening sessions with aviation industry associations and
the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Licensing Panel and from issues
identified in legal interpretations, petitions for exemption, petitions for rulemaking, and enforcement actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results of this survey showed clear support for: (1) replacing the term ``mechanic'' with ``aviation maintenance
technician''; (2) developing a system for granting additional privileges and limitations for mechanics; (3) encouraging
additional FAA participation with ICAO and other aviation authorities to standardize training and certification
of maintenance personnel; (4) using aviation maintenance instructor experience to satisfy recent experience requirements;
(5) clarifying &sect;65.75(b), written test requirements; (6) adding ``facsimile'' to &sect;65.16; and (7) developing
a separate certificate or rating for balloon repairmen. The majority of the respondents supported changes in the
English-language requirements for both mechanics and repairmen, the continued acceptance of military aircraft
maintenance experience as the basis for airframe and powerplant mechanic certification, and changing the units
of time used in &sect;65.77 to designate experience requirements for mechanics from months to hours.

General Discussion of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals developed during phase I of the Part 65 regulatory review and set forth in this NPRM cover a broad range
of issues affecting the certification of aviation maintenance personnel. The proposals included in this NPRM would:
(1) establish a separate part for aviation maintenance personnel; (2) remove gender-specific terms from the current
regulation; (3) change the term ``mechanic'' to ``aviation maintenance technician''; (4) change the term ``repairman''
to ``aviation repair specialist''; (5) establish the equivalency of the aviation maintenance technician and aviation
repair specialist certificates with current certificates; (6) allow facsimiles to be used in the process of replacing
lost or destroyed aviation maintenance technician and aviation repair specialist certificates; (7) require applicants
to demonstrate English-language proficiency by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications
and by writing defect and repair statements; (8) discontinue the certification of aviation maintenance personnel
who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language; (9) require all aviation
maintenance technician applicants to pass a written test that would examine their knowledge of all applicable maintenance
regulations; (10) clarify the requirement that each applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate
pass all sections of the written test before applying for oral and practical tests; (11) recognize new computer-based
testing methods; (12) specify all experience requirements in hours instead of months; (13) establish a basic competency
requirement for aviation maintenance technicians; (14) allow aviation maintenance technicians to use equipment-specific
training as an additional means to qualify for the exercise of certificate privileges; (15) permit aviation maintenance
instructors to use instructional time to satisfy currency requirements; (16) establish training requirements
for aviation maintenance technicians who desire to use their certificates for compensation or hire; (17) extend
the duration of an inspection authorization from 1 to 2 years; and (18) expand the renewal options available to the
holder of an inspection authorization.

The FAA proposes to establish a new Part 66 under the title, Certification: Aviation Maintenance Technicians and
Aviation Repair Specialists. This new part would be created by removing Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen)
from the current Part 65 and using these existing subparts as the nucleus for the newly created Subparts B (Aviation
Maintenance Technicians) and C (Aviation Repair Specialists) under Part 66. The sections of the current Part 65 Subpart
A (General) that apply only to aviation maintenance personnel would be included in Subpart A of the proposed Part 66.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to regulating the certification requirements for aviation maintenance personnel, Part 65 also currently
regulates the certification of airmen such as aircraft dispatchers, air traffic controllers, and parachute riggers,
whose certification requirements and duties differ markedly from those of aviation maintenance personnel. Currently,
there are more than 145,000 certificated mechanics and repairmen. The number of certificated aviation maintenance
personnel is second only to the number of certificated pilots. Aviation maintenance personnel work in all aspects
of the aviation environment, perform tasks vastly different from those performed by other airmen, and are affected
by training and currency requirements that are substantially more extensive than those affecting other airmen currently
regulated by Part 65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The aviation maintenance sector is one of the most complex sectors of the aviation community and all aviation maintenance
personnel must possess many technical skills. The addition of this part to the FAR is warranted because of the complexity
of the certification and training requirements affecting aviation maintenance personnel. In addition, the certification
requirements for aviation maintenance personnel are expanding under this proposed rule, and additional certificates
and ratings are proposed for creation under phase II of the regulatory review.

In accordance with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations and maintaining conformity with
other recently revised airman certification regulations that are now gender-neutral, and in view of the increased
role of women in the aviation maintenance profession, the FAA proposes to eliminate all gender-specific references
in current Part 65 and proposed Part 66. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment; however, specific
changes are not listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

Redesignation of the Term ``Mechanic''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of changes in aircraft technology, the amount of specialized training required to perform aviation maintenance
has increased significantly since the introduction of the term ``mechanic.'' The highly complex and technical field
of contemporary aviation maintenance requires substantially more than the manual skills typically associated
with individuals classified as mechanics. The FAA asserts that the term ``aviation maintenance technician'' more
completely describes the type of skills necessary to maintain today's complex aircraft and more accurately reflects
the level of professionalism found in the aviation maintenance industry. Additionally, adoption of the term ``aviation
maintenance technician'' would standardize terminology throughout the aviation industry and make Part 66 consistent
with Part 147 of the FAR (which regulates Aviation Maintenance Technician Schools), aviation maintenance trade
publications, and many ICAO member states. These changes are reflected in the proposed amendment, however, specific
changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

Redesignation of the Term ``Repairman''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In view of the specialized nature of aviation maintenance tasks performed by currently certificated repairmen,
the FAA proposes that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' replace the current term ``repairman.'' The FAA contends
that the term ``aviation repair specialist'' more accurately reflects the level of expertise required to maintain
today's highly complex aviation systems. In addition, the use of the term ``aviation repair specialist'' would serve
to increase the level of professionalism among aviation maintenance personnel. Adoption of the term would also be
consistent with the FAA's policy of implementing gender-neutral regulations. These changes are reflected in the
proposed amendment; however, specific changes have not been listed in the section-by-section general analysis.

Equivalency of Ratings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any valid mechanic or repairman certificate would be equivalent to an aviation maintenance technician or aviation
repair specialist certificate, respectively. After implementation of this regulation, the holder of a current
mechanic or repairman certificate may continue to exercise the privileges of the corresponding aviation maintenance
technician or aviation repair specialist certificate and may exchange a current mechanic or repairman certificate
for an aviation maintenance technician or aviation repair specialist certificate respectively. Phase I of the regulatory
review does not create additional certificates or ratings.

Replacement of Lost or Destroyed Certificates by Facsimile
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would revise current procedures by permitting an airman who has lost a certificate issued under proposed
Part 66 to request a facsimile of the certificate from the FAA as confirmation of the certificate's original issuance.
The proposal would also allow any request to the FAA to be made by facsimile and would permit the FAA to send directly
to the airman a facsimile that the airman may carry as proof of the original certificate's issuance for a period not
to exceed 60 days. Adoption of the proposed change would make the rule consistent with current practices implemented
by the Airman Certification Branch (AVN&hyph;460) at the Aviation Standards National Field Office in Oklahoma City.
Current regulations specify the use of telegrams only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change reflects advancements in communications technology and would speed access to FAA services by permitting
the use of other means, such as telephone facsimile or computer modem, to obtain a replacement certificate. The use
of these means would speed the replacement of lost certificates to the airman, thereby decreasing the time during
which the airman may not exercise the privileges of a certificate of rating. Similar provisions are under consideration
for adoption in other parts of the FAR.

Demonstration of English-Language Proficiency and Removal of Exception Criteria for Applicants Employed Outside
the United States Who Are Not Proficient in the English Language
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would require an applicant for an aviation maintenance technician certificate or aviation repair specialist
certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language, as is currently required for applicants
desiring to exercise the privileges of the certificate within the United States. The proposal would require the applicant
to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect
and repair statements. The proposal also would eliminate the issuances of certificates to individuals who cannot
meet this requirement and are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station, or
a certificated U.S. air carrier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal recognizes the highly technical nature of aviation maintenance in today's aviation industry. Proficiency
with the general terminology of the English language is not sufficient to ensure the competency of an aviation maintenance
technician or repair specialist. The individual must be able to understand and master the complex and often very specialized
language of airworthiness instructions and other terminology associated with the maintenance of highly sophisticated
aviation equipment. In operations conducted at certificated U.S. air carriers, certificated U.S. commercial operators,
and U.S.-certificated repair stations, the vast majority of technical information is conveyed in the English language.
The FAA has determined that the proposed rule would guarantee a level of competency that would ensure that an applicant
for either certificate is able to use all relevant maintenance publications effectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposed that the current exception, which permits the certification of mechanics (aviation maintenance
technicians) who are employed outside the United States and are not proficient in the English language, be deleted.
The current airframe, powerplant, and general written tests for mechanics are all written in the English language.
Applicants taking these tests must be proficient in the English language to complete these examinations successfully;
therefore, the exception is not necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although repairmen (aviation repair specialists) are not required to take written tests, these individuals also
work in environments that require more than mere proficiency in the English language. Because the FAA does not certify
repairmen working under U.S.-certificated foreign repair stations and because of the need for all certificated
repairmen to understand technical material written in English, the FAA also proposed that all repairmen (aviation
repair specialists) demonstrate proficiency in the English language and that the exception allowing individuals
who are not proficient in the English language to be certificated to work only outside the United States be deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current holders of a mechanic or repairman certificate, who do not meet the English language requirement and are employed
outside of the United States by a certificated U.S. air carrier or a certificated U.S. repair station, would continue
to exercise the privileges of their certificate without a further showing of competency. Their certificates would
remain endorsed ``Valid only outside of the United States.''

Establishment of a Requirement for Aviation Maintenance Technicians To Pass a Written Test on all Applicable Provisions
of Chapter 14
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current regulations require an applicant for a mechanic (aviation maintenance technician) certificate to pass
a written test that includes the applicable provisions of Parts 43 and 91 of this chapter. Because contemporary maintenance
operations require the applicant to understand certification and maintenance regulations other than those found
solely in Parts 43 and 91, the FAA proposes amending the knowledge requirements for the certificate to require an applicant
to pass a written test on the applicable provisions of the entire chapter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Clarification of Requirement To Pass all Sections of the Written Test Before Applying for the Oral and Practical Tests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There has been some confusion among applicants for the mechanic (aviation maintenance technician) certificate
who are not enrolled at Part-147-approved aviation maintenance technician schools regarding the language of &sect;65.75(b).
This section requires an individual to pass each section of the written test before applying for the oral and practical
tests prescribed by &sect;65.79. The FAA believes that it is essential that the applicant display knowledge of the
equipment and procedures to be used by the applicant before the oral and practical tests are given. The applicant must
possess adequate knowledge before being permitted to take the oral and practical tests, because it is this knowledge
that enables an applicant to solve practical problems and demonstrate the ability to perform the work of a certificated
aviation maintenance technician. In addition, when taking an oral or practical test, an applicant for a certificate
must handle complex equipment; a lack of knowledge about the use of that equipment could injure the applicant or others.
Therefore, the FAA has clarified the current requirement by proposing amendatory language that would require all
applicants, except students at an approved Part 147 aviation maintenance school, to pass all sections of the written
test before applying for the oral and practical tests.

Recognition of New Written Testing Methods

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the area of written testing, the FAA recognizes recent developments in training and testing technology. Because
the results of some written tests, such as those from recently approved computer-based testing, can be made immediately
available to the applicant, the FAA proposes that a report of the written test be made available, as opposed to sent,
to an applicant who has taken the examination using computer-based testing.

Specification of Experience Requirements in Hours
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes that experience requirements for aviation maintenance personnel, currently expressed in months,
be expressed in an equivalent number of hours. A change to the hourly experience requirements would give the FAA and
the aviation industry a simpler method of measuring and verifying work experience. The proposed revision also would
enable aviation maintenance personnel working in part-time positions to better quantify their work experience.
FAA Order 8300.10, Airworthiness Inspector's Handbook, currently permits the practice of measuring part-time
experience requirements in hours. The proposed rule would expand this current practice by measuring both part-time
and full-time experience in hours. Equivalent levels of full time experience are: 6 months/1000 hours; 18 months/3000
hours; 30 months/5000 hours.

Establishment of Basic Competency Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently &sect;65.79, Skill requirements, requires an applicant for a mechanic certificate to pass an oral and
practical test covering the applicant's skills in performing practical projects covered by the written test. Because
of the complexity of current aviation maintenance operations, the FAA proposes to establish a broad-based competency
requirement in &sect;66.79 that encompasses more than the skill requirements included in the current regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current interpretations of the existing regulation tend to emphasize the evaluation of basic skills that often concentrate
solely on tasks involving manual dexterity. Although mastery of these basic skills is invaluable, the FAA asserts
that a more comprehensive level of competency, based on current aviation maintenance practices, is required of aviation
maintenance technicians. The proposed rule would expand the evaluation of aviation maintenance technician applicants
to include a demonstration of competency in technical tasks and aircraft maintenance more appropriate to the current
aviation environment and the certificate and rating sought.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Equipment-Specific Training to Qualify for Certificate Privileges
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Through the use of equipment-specific training, the proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance
technician certificate with an additional means to remain qualified to approve and return to service any aircraft,
appliance, or part for which that person is rated and to supervise the maintenance, preventive maintenance, alteration,
and return to service of these aircraft, appliances, and parts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, a certificate holder may supervise maintenance operations or approve and return to
service an aircraft, appliance, or part if the certificate holder has: (1) previously performed the work; (2) performed
the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator; or (3) performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated
mechanic or repairman who has had previous experience with that specific task.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to use equipment-specific training to obtain the competency
necessary to supervise these operations or approve an item for return to service without previously having performed
the work that is anticipated. Through the adoption of equipment-specific training to satisfy this experience requirement,
the FAA recognized enhancements in aviation maintenance training that can provide the aviation maintenance technician
with technical knowledge equal to knowledge gained in the work environment. However, in allowing training to replace
actual work experience, the FAA would require a high level of specificity between the training and the actual work
to be preformed or supervised. Therefore, the proposal would require that the training used to satisfy this requirement
be unique to the specific equipment on which the work is to be performed. A course of instruction detailing the maintenance
practices for the same make and model aircraft on which an aviation maintenance technician will perform work, or a
course of instruction detailing the overhaul procedures for a specific part or appliance, for example, would satisfy
the provisions of the proposed rule. Such courses may be provided by any manufacturer, individual, or organization
whose training has been found acceptable to the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training of a more general nature, which may be used to satisfy currency requirements as proposed in &sect;66.83,
may not be sufficiently specific to allow an aviation maintenance technician to perform work on a specific aircraft,
part, or appliance. For example, a course in the FAR applicable to maintenance procedures would not satisfy the provisions
of proposed &sect;66.81 but could be used to satisfy the provisions of proposed &sect;66.83.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also proposes to clarify the intent of the current regulation by proposing amendatory language that would
allow a certificate holder, who desires to exercise supervisory, return to service, or approval responsibilities,
to demonstrate the ability to perform the work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires
actual performance of the work.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of Instructional Time by Aviation Maintenance Instructors to Satisfy Currency Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current &sect;65.83, there are no provisions for allowing individuals involved in aviation maintenance instruction
to use that experience for maintaining the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and
ratings. The FAA recognizes that the experience gained while providing aviation maintenance instruction or directly
supervising other aviation maintenance instructors is commensurate with the experience obtained while directly
performing aviation maintenance. The FAA already recognizes this experience in current &sect;65.91(c)(2). Within
that section the phrase ``actively engaged'' includes instructors who are exercising the privileges of their certificate
and ratings at an aviation maintenance school certificated under Part 147 of this chapter. Therefore, the FAA proposes
to allow the use of instructional time also to satisfy currency requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, a certificate holder would qualify to maintain currency by serving as an aviation maintenance
instructor or by directly supervising other aviation maintenance instructors under his or her certificate or rating.
The instruction concerned would have to be directly related to aviation maintenance and acceptable to the Administrator,
so that the time an individual spends providing instruction or directly supervising other instructors is equivalent
to the experience gained while performing aviation maintenance tasks. For example, instructional time provided
at Part 147 aviation maintenance technician schools or under an approved air carrier maintenance training program
would be acceptable and would meet the intent of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of currency requirements is to ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians are familiar with current
maintenance practices and the applicable FAR. The aviation maintenance instructor must keep abreast of current
maintenance practices in a wide variety of disciplines to provide the high quality instruction required. Aviation
maintenance instructors perform a critical function in the aviation maintenance education process, and the FAA
believes that the adoption of the proposed rule would recognize this importance.

Establishment of Training Requirements for Certificated Aviation Maintenance Technicians Exercising the Privileges
of their Certificates for Compensation or Hire
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under current Part 65, there are no specific provisions that require the training of certificated mechanics. Current
regulations ensure that certificated aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121,
127, 135, and 145.2(a) are informed fully about procedures, techniques, and new equipment in use through participation
in maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs. In an effort to ensure that all aviation maintenance
technicians are informed of current maintenance practices in the rapidly changing aviation maintenance environment,
the FAA proposes the adoption of refresher training, requalification training, and other training appropriate
to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician, for aviation maintenance technicians who use their certificates
for compensation or hire and do not participate in the maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs
referenced above. This proposal would ensure that all aviation maintenance technicians who exercise the privileges
of their certificates for compensation or hire and have the sole responsibility for ensuring the airworthiness of
the equipment on which they perform maintenance meet training requirements similar to those currently in place for
aviation maintenance technicians supporting operations under Parts 121, 127, 135, and 145.2(a). In addition, this
proposal would also ensure that aviation maintenance technicians who support U.S. certificated repair stations
that do not have maintenance and preventive maintenance training programs receive comparable training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule, an aviation maintenance technician who meets the prescribed work experience requirements
and wishes to exercise the privileges of the certificate or rating for compensation or hire would be required to complete
refresher training or other training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An aviation maintenance technician refresher course, inspection authorization refresher course, or a series of
such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator and consist of a total of not less than 16 hours of instruction
within a 24-month period could be used to satisfy the refresher training requirement. The completion of an inspection
authorization refresher course by an aviation maintenance technician who does not hold a current inspection authorization
would also constitute completion of the mandatory aviation maintenance technician training requirement. Adoption
of such a provision would increase the range of training options available to the aviation maintenance technician
and would enhance the individual's understanding of the inspection authorization process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to refresher training, an aviation maintenance technician wishing to exercise the privileges
of the certificate and ratings for compensation or hire may complete other training appropriate to the duties of an
aviation maintenance technician. This training may be broad based and would consist of a course or courses of instruction,
acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours within a 24-month period. Completion of courses dealing
with general maintenance practices or regulations applicable to maintenance operations, for example, would satisfy
the intent of this proposed rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA recognizes that many certificated aviation maintenance technicians, who support Part 91 operations or other
maintenance facilities without maintenance or preventive maintenance training programs in place, receive periodic
maintenance training. For example, these aviation maintenance technicians may receive training through aviation
training centers or manufacturer's courses. The proposed rule would permit this type of maintenance instruction
to be credited toward the hours needed to complete the proposed training requirements, provided the instruction
is acceptable to the Administrator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The training required under this provision, as set forth in proposed &sect;66.83, encompasses more types of training
than the training that may be used to satisfy the provision of the proposed &sect;66.81. Therefore, compliance with
proposed &sect;66.83 does not automatically authorize the aviation maintenance technician to perform a specific
task. Additionally, equipment-specific training is encompassed within the concept of ``training appropriate
to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician.'' Equipment-specific training used by the aviation maintenance
technician to satisfy the requirements of proposed &sect;66.81 also may be used to satisfy the proposed currency
requirements. For example, an aviation maintenance technician who received maintenance training on a Gulfstream
IV aircraft that enabled the aviation maintenance technician to perform work on that specific aircraft may credit
the hours of instruction received toward the training required in proposed &sect;66.83.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual who exercises the privileges of the certificate, but not for compensation or hire, would not need to
complete these training requirements. Many of the individuals who do not exercise their privileges for compensation
or hire perform only limited work on aircraft that they own or on a limited range of aeronautical equipment. In such
cases, knowledge of a broad range of current maintenance technologies is not necessarily required. Although the
FAA encourages these personnel to attend refresher training, the FAA has determined that a mandatory training requirement
for these individuals is not warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also sets forth a provision that would permit an aviation maintenance technician who has not exercised
the privileges of the certificate within the preceding 24 months to exercise the privileges of the certificate including
for compensation or hire by completing requalification training acceptable to the Administrator. A specific minimum
time for requalification training has not been specified in the proposed regulation in order to provide instructors
and examiners with greater flexibility in assisting non-current aviation maintenance technicians to achieve the
required proficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional change to the current rule would enhance the ability of non-current aviation maintenance technicians
to regain the currency required to exercise the privileges of their certificate and ratings. The proposed rule would
allow these individuals to credit the time they work under the supervision of a certificated aviation maintenance
technician toward currency requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The holder also may continue to exercise the privileges of the certificate and associated ratings if the Administrator
finds that the aviation maintenance technician is competent to exercise those privileges. Passing an oral and practical
test with a designed aviation maintenance technician examiner (currently, a designated mechanic examiner (DME))
would satisfy this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 121.375, 127.137, and 135.433 require that an operator have a training program to ensure that persons performing
maintenance or preventive maintenance functions are informed fully about procedures and techniques and new equipment
in use. Additionally, &sect;145.2(a) requires that repair stations performing maintenance for a Part 121 or 127
operator comply with either Part 121, Subpart L (which includes the requirements of &sect;121.375) or Part 127, Subpart
I (which includes the requirements of &sect;127.137). Compliance with any of these sections meets the intent of the
proposed rule. Individuals exercising the privileges of their certificates under the provisions of these sections,
therefore, need not comply with the training requirements set forth in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, an aviation maintenance instructor teaching under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable
to the Administrator need not comply with these proposed training requirements. As a result of their position as aviation
maintenance instructors, these individuals continually are exposed to current maintenance practices and often
disseminate information about new practices, techniques, and equipment to the aviation maintenance community.
The intent of the proposed rule would be satisfied because their position requires these individuals to be fully informed
about current maintenance practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of enhancements in training technology, the proposed rule also requires successful completion of
these courses rather than attendance and successful completion. Therefore, the Administrator may find home study
or video courses acceptable for fulfilling the requirements specified in the proposed &sect;66.83. However, any
training should include a substantial review of regulations pertinent to the exercise of the privileges and limitations
of the aviation maintenance technician certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal for continued aviation maintenance training addresses concerns such as those expressed in recent
proposals to require formal training for all aircraft mechanic applicants. In conjunction with the issuance of a
proposed final rule, the FAA will develop policy on the content and conduct of any aviation maintenance technician
refresher course, other training appropriate to the duties of the aviation maintenance technician (including equipment-specific
training), and requalification training.

Extension of Inspection Authorization Duration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, the duration of an inspection authorization would be extended from the current 12 months
to 24 months. Extending the duration of the inspection authorization would make the authorization consistent with
FAA practices regarding the issuance of other renewable certificates, such as the flight instructor certificate,
which is renewed every 24 months. A 24-month renewal cycle would relieve the public of a significant regulatory burden
and FAA Flight Standards District Offices of a considerable administrative burden without compromising safety.
Modifying the existing training and currency requirements to coincide with the adoption of a 24-month renewal cycle
would give holders greater flexibility in meeting regulatory requirements.

Expansion of Inspection Authorization Renewal Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections
of major repairs or major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection
authorization. Such a provision would give the holder of an inspection authorization much greater flexibility in
meeting renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections for the purpose of certificate
renewal with other inspection periods currently designated in months, the proposal would change the currently specified
90-day periods for inspections to 3-month periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would also permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use participation in current inspection
programs recommended by the manufacturer or other inspection programs established by the registered owner or operator
under &sect;91.409(f)(3) or (4) to satisfy renewal requirements. Although an inspection authorization is not required
by an aviation maintenance technician in order to participate in these inspection programs, the FAA asserts that
the experience gained through participation in such inspection programs is commensurate with the experience currently
accepted to obtain the inspection authorization renewal. This proposal would benefit holders of an inspection authorization
who are employed by operators that maintain aircraft under a current inspection program yet also maintain an insufficient
number of aircraft under other annual inspection programs to provide the holder of the inspection authorization
with sufficient renewal options under the current rule. The proposed rule would neither change the privileges of
the inspection authorization nor compromise safety because the types of aircraft normally maintained under a current
inspection program are often more complex than those maintained under an annual inspection program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the inspection authorization
by attending and successfully completing a refresher course, acceptable to the Administrator, of not less than 8
hours during the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would modify the duration
of the inspection authorization to 24 months, it would require that an inspection authorization refresher course
or series of courses consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application
for renewal. The proposed rule would not change the total amount of instruction an applicant is required to complete
in the 24-month period preceding the application for renewal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the title of Part 65 would be amended to reflect the removal of Subparts D (Mechanics) and E (Repairmen)
from this part. The proposal would amend the title of Part 65 by revising the title of the part and would specifically
list airmen whose certification would continue to be regulated by this part. The title would be changed from ``Certification:
Airmen Other than Flight Crewmembers'' to ``Certification: Air-Traffic Control Tower Operators, Aircraft Dispatchers,
and Parachute Riggers.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 65.1 currently states that Part 65 is applicable to air traffic control tower operators, aircraft dispatchers,
mechanics, repairmen, and parachute riggers. Under the proposal, certification of mechanics and repairmen (aviation
maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists under the proposed rule would be regulated by Part 66. The
proposal would revise &sect;65.1 by limiting the applicability of this part to air traffic control tower operators,
aircraft dispatchers, and parachute riggers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 65.3 prescribes the certification requirements for foreign mechanics. Because the proposal would place
the certification for all mechanics under Part 66, this section would be removed from Part 65 and reserved. An equivalent
section, &sect;66.3, is proposed for inclusion in Part 66.

Currently, &sect;65.11(d)(2) prohibits a person whose repairman or mechanic certificate is revoked from applying
for either of those kinds of certificates for 1 year after the date of revocation, unless the order of revocation provides
otherwise. Because the proposal would place the certification of all mechanics and repairmen under Part 66, this
paragraph would be removed from Part 65; an equivalent paragraph, &sect;66.11(d), has been proposed for inclusion
in Part 66.

Under the proposal, a new Part 66 prescribing the certification requirements solely for aviation maintenance personnel
would be created. Part 66 would include Subpart A (General), Subpart B (Aviation Maintenance Technicians), and Subpart
C (Aviation Repair Specialists). Subpart A (General) would be based on Part 65, Subpart A and modified to address regulatory
concerns applicable to aviation maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists. The proposal would establish

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.71 is based upon the current &sect;65.71 and differs from that section solely in the language
of subparagraph (a)(2). The proposal differs from current &sect;65.71, because in addition to requiring an applicant
for an aviation maintenance technician certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English language,
as is currently required, it would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading and explaining
appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal also differs from
the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot meet this requirement
and who are employed solely outside the United States by a U.S. air carrier.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed section is based on current &sect;65.75. The proposed revisions to the current knowledge requirements
encompass the current requirement that the applicant be tested in the applicable provisions of Parts 43 and 91 of this
chapter and also expand the knowledge required of an applicant by requiring the applicant to pass a written test that
includes material on all applicable provisions of this chapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the increased use of computer-based testing, the proposal would require a report of the written test to

Section 66.81
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.81, based on current &sect;65.81, would define the privileges and limitations of a certificate
holder under this part. The proposed revision to the current privileges and limitations of certificate holders would
clarify and expand the manner in which an aviation maintenance technician may become qualified to supervise the maintenance,
preventive maintenance, or alteration of any aircraft, or approve and return to service any aircraft or appliance,
or part thereof, for which that person is rated. The proposal would provide the holder of an aviation maintenance technician
certificate with additional means to qualify for the exercise of these privileges. In addition to the means specified
in the current &sect;65.81, the holder may exercise the privileges mentioned above if the aviation maintenance technician
has received the equipment-specific training or has performed the work under the direct supervision of a certificated
and appropriately rated aviation maintenance technician or certificated aviation repair specialist who has also
received equipment-specific training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposal would clarify &sect;65.81 by permitting the holder of an aviation maintenance technician
certificate to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings by demonstrating the ability to perform the
work to the satisfaction of the Administrator. The current regulation requires actual performance of the work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would require that the work recognized under proposed &sect;66.81 be performed after the
individual has been certificated as an aviation maintenance technician. Work performed while an individual is in
training for certification as an aviation maintenance technician may not necessarily be of the same quality required
for the return to service of an article, and therefore would not be credited toward satisfying the requirements specified
in &sect;66.81.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would require that a certificated aviation maintenance technician understand all current maintenance
instructions (as opposed to maintenance manuals) for the specific operation concerned in order to exercise the privileges
of the certificate and rating.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed &sect;66.83 would prescribe the specific currency requirements for aviation maintenance technicians.
This proposed section is based on current &sect;65.83, Recent experience requirements. The proposal would provide
the holder of an aviation maintenance technician certificate with additional means to maintain the currency required
to exercise the privileges of the certificate and ratings. In addition to the means currently specified in &sect;65.83(a),
the proposal would allow the aviation maintenance technician to maintain the currency required to exercise the privileges
of the certificate, if the person served as an aviation maintenance instructor under an aviation maintenance training
program acceptable to the Administrator, directly supervised other aviation maintenance instructors, who are
serving under an aviation maintenance training program acceptable to the Administrator, or served under the supervision
of a certificated aviation maintenance technician. The proposal also would allow the use of any combination of the
proposed and current methods to maintain currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would create a new subparagraph that would require the successful completion of refresher training
or training appropriate to the duties of an aviation maintenance technician if the individual desires to exercise
the privileges of the certificate or ratings for compensation or hire. The refresher training may consist of an aviation
maintenance technician refresher course, an inspection authorization course, or a series of courses, acceptable
to the Administrator, of not less than 16 hours of instruction. Training appropriate to the work to be performed must
also be acceptable to the Administrator and consist of not less than 16 hours of instruction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would not require all aviation maintenance technicians to complete the new training requirements.
An aviation maintenance technician, who within the preceding 24 months exercised the privileges of the certificate
and ratings for a certificate holder authorized to operate under the provisions of Parts 121, 127, 135, or for a U.S.-certificated
repair station that performed work in accordance with &sect;145.2(a) or conducted a maintenance and preventive
maintenance training program, would not be subject to the proposed training requirements. Additionally, aviation
maintenance instructors teaching under an aviation maintenance training program that is acceptable to the Administrator
need not complete the proposed training requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal sets forth an additional provision that would permit the aviation maintenance technician to exercise
the privileges of the certificate for compensation or hire if the certificate holder successfully completes a requalification
course acceptable to the Administrator.

so that it would corresponds to the extension of the inspection authorization as proposed in &sect;66.92 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal would permit the holder of an inspection authorization to use a combination of annual inspections, inspections
of major repairs on major alterations, and progressive inspections to satisfy the renewal requirements for the inspection
authorization. Participation in current inspection programs recommended by the manufacturer of other inspection
programs established by the registered owner or operator under &sect;91.409(f)(3) or (4) now also may be used to satisfy
renewal requirements. To better facilitate the combination of these inspections, the proposal would change the
currently specified 90-day period to a 3-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current regulation, the holder of an inspection authorization may renew the authorization by attending
and successfully completing a refresher course of not less than 8 hours, acceptable to the Administrator, during
the 12-month period preceding the application for renewal. Because the proposal would change the duration of the
inspection authorization to 24 months, the proposal would require that an inspection authorization refresher course
or series of course consisting of a total of not less than 16 hours be taken in the 24 months preceding the application
for renewal. The proposed rule does not change the total amount of instruction the applicant must complete in the 24-month
preceding the application for renewal. The proposed rule also differs from the current regulation in that it only
requires successful completion (as opposed to attendance and successful completion) of an inspection authorization
refresher course. The proposal recognizes recent developments in instructional techniques and permits instruction
methods, acceptable to the Administrator, that may differ from the standard classroom or lecture format.

The structure of part 66, Subpart C, is based upon the current structure of Part 65, Subpart D. Under the proposed rule,

The proposed &sect;66.101 would prescribe the general eligibility requirements for the aviation repair specialist
certificate. This proposed section is based on current &sect;65.101. The proposal would specify the current 18-month
experience requirement in hours instead of months. The 3,000 hours of experience specified in the proposal approximately
equal the current full-time 18-month experience requirement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal differs from the current &sect;65.101 in the language of paragraph (a)(6). The proposal would not only
require an applicant for an aviation repair specialist certificate to read, write, speak, and understand the English
language, as is currently required, but also would require the applicant to demonstrate this knowledge by reading
and explaining appropriate maintenance publications and by writing defect and repair statements. The proposal
also differs from the current section in that it would eliminate the issuance of certificates to individuals who cannot
meet this requirement and who are employed solely outside the United States by a certificated U.S. repair station,
a certificated U.S. commercial operator, or a certificated U.S. air carrier. The language in this portion of the proposed
rule corresponds with the language proposed in &sect;66.71(a)(2), which similarly amends the eligibility requirements
for the aviation maintenance technician certificate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal adds to this section paragraph (c), which establishes the equivalency of the current repairman certificate
and the proposed aviation repair specialist certificate. The proposal also provides for the exchange of corresponding
certificates and ratings.

Regulatory Evaluation Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain
current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a
``compelling public need.'' The order also requires that agencies assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and select the alternative that maximizes the net benefits and imposes the least burden on society.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the order requires agencies to submit a list of all rules, except those specifically exempted by the
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) because they respond to emergency situations or other narrowly
defined exigencies, to determine whether any rule is a ``significant regulatory action.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Significant regulatory action'' means an action that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) have an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities;
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients
thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the
principles set forth in the Executive Order. A ``significant regulatory action'' is submitted for centralized regulatory
review by OIRA. OIRA and the FAA have determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section contains the benefits and costs analyzed in the preliminary regulatory evaluation. In addition, it
includes an initial regulatory flexibility determination required by the 1980 Regulatory Flexibility Act and an
international trade impact assessment. The complete regulatory evaluation, which contains more detailed economic
information that this summary provides, is available in the docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule change would revise the regulations that prescribe the certification and training requirements
for mechanics and repairmen. The proposal would enhance the professionalism of the aviation maintenance workforce
by expanding the means for aviation maintenance personnel to satisfy training, experience, and currency requirements.
Employers would also benefit from the increased supply of potential employees who are expected to maintain their
currency because of the wider range of options for achieving this objective that would be permitted under the proposal.
Another benefit for employers is expected to be an increase in the quality of new hires, thereby lessening the need
for initial training to assure that these employees have basic skills and knowledge. Recurrent training is also expected
to assist aviation maintenance personnel in staying abreast of the rapid changes in technology that are expected
to occur. The expected magnitude of these benefits cannot be quantified with any certainty, however, because of their
intangible nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one of the provisions would impose significant costs on the industry. This provision would require mechanics
who use their certificates for compensation or hire to receive refresher or requalification training. At present,
certified mechanics working under Parts 121, 127, and 135 and &sect;145.2(a) must be fully informed about procedures,
techniques, and new equipment in use through participation in maintenance and preventive maintenance training
programs. These mechanics are, therefore, already in compliance with the proposed rule. This proposed requirement
for recurrent training would primarily affect those mechanics who work on general aviation aircraft rather than
aircraft used by the air carriers. The FAA estimates that this proposed rule would affect from 14,000 to 23,000 mechanics
of a total workforce of about 145,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taking an Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) refresher courts, an inspection authorization refresher course,
or a series of such courses that are acceptable to the Administrator, would satisfy the requirements of this proposed
rule. However, the course or courses taken within a 2-year time period must consist of a total of not less than 16 hours
of instruction. This training may be broad based or narrowly focused but must be acceptable to the Administrator.
For example, courses dealing with general maintenance practices of regulations applicable to maintenance operations
as well as equipment-specific training would be acceptable. Some home study or video courses may also be acceptable
for fulfilling this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the total expected cost of recurrent training over a 10-year period would range between $37.28
million and $66.53 million on an undiscounted basis and between $25.94 million and $46.48 million on a discounted
basis. The midpoints of these ranges are $51.91 million (undiscounted) and $36.21 million (discounted).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The bulk of the expected benefits are expected to accrue from productivity gains. Productivity is expected to increase
because recurrent training in troubleshooting techniques or general maintenance practices should reduce the amount
of time required to diagnose problems and lower the incidence of unnecessary repairs, which inflate repair costs.
The lack of information regarding the prevalence of inefficient or ineffective repairs makes it difficult to project
the potential magnitude of the benefits expected to result from this factor. The adoption of the conservative assumption
that productivity would increase by only .5 percent per year, however, would result in an annualized benefit range
(undiscounted) of $4.17 million to $6.39 million, the midpoint of which ($5.28 million) would exceed the expected
magnitude of undiscounted annual costs, making the rule change cost beneficial.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative cost savings are expected to add to the benefits. The most substantial component of these savings
should result from reducing the current annual requirement for IA renewal to a biennial one. The FAA estimates that
these cost savings for the FAA would amount to $.71 million on a discounted basis over a 10-year period. A provision
that would allow mechanics to substitute a requalification course for the requirement to work at least 6 months over
the previous 2 years in order to maintain one's currency would benefit employers by not only increasing the pool of
available qualified mechanics, but also by saving them the administrative costs involved in checking an applicant's
qualifications for the job. These benefits could not be quantified.

Regulatory Flexibility Determination

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congres to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules which may
have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Small entities include businesses,
nonprofit organizations, and government jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation will affect individuals only and is, therefore, not expected to have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small businesses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

involved in the sale of aviation products or services.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation proposed herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings in the Regulatory Flexibility Determination
and the International Trade Impact Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a significant
regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. In addition, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, would
not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the
criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is not considered significant under DOT Order 2100.5,
Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations. A draft regulatory evaluation
of the proposal, including an initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and International Trade Impact Analysis,
has been placed in the docket. A copy may be obtained by contacting the person identified under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission today is proposing amendments to its rules and forms regarding the filing of ownership reports by officers,
directors, and principal security holders, and the exemption of certain transactions by those persons from the short-swing
profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') and related provisions
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
The proposed rules are intended to streamline the Section 16 regulatory scheme, particularly with respect to employee
benefit plans; broaden exemptions from short-swing profit recovery where consistent with the statutory purposes;
and codify several staff interpretive positions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1991, in response to developments in the trading of derivative securities, the growth of complex and diverse
employee benefit plans, and substantial filing delinquencies, the Commission adopted extensive changes to the
beneficial ownership and short-swing profit recovery rules and forms applicable to insiders
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to Section 16.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After three years of experience, unanticipated practical difficulties still arise in applying the new Section 16
rules, particularly with respect to thrift and similar employee benefit plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule changes proposed today address these practical problems and further streamline the rules, to the extent
consistent with the purposes of Section 16.

Release No. 34&hyph;28869 (February 8, 1991) [56 FR 7242] (``Adopting Release''). The rules generally became effective
on May 1, 1991, except for the phase-in period for compliance with the substantive conditions of new Rule 16b-3. The
phase-in period has been extended until September 1, 1995 or such different date as may be set in further rulemaking
(Release No. 34&hyph;34513 (August 10, 1994)).

Following the Adopting Release, the Commission issued two other releases relating to the revised rules; one set forth
the Commission's interpretive views regarding shareholder approval for amendments to employee benefit plans under
Rule 16b&hyph;3, as well as certain technical amendments (Release No. 34&hyph;29131 (April 26, 1991) [56 FR 19925]),
while the other adopted a technical amendment to Form 4 (Release No. 34&hyph;28869B (April 10, 1991) [56 FR 14467]).

A. Employee Benefit Plan Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of the proposed rules is the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions. In particular, the proposals
would: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt from short-swing profit recovery all purchase transactions in thrift and other broad-based, tax-qualified
plans, other than those involving transfers to and from an employer securities fund; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exempt from short-swing profit recovery transfers to and from employer securities funds in thrift and other plans
that are effected either during a quarterly window period or pursuant to a diversification election under the Internal
Revenue Code; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Expand exemptions for plan distributions in connection with retirement or specified transactions authorized by
the Internal Revenue Code; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide that exempt dispositions within six months of an exempt grant would not destroy the exemption for the grant;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' cash-only instruments issued as compensation by an employer
to an employee; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights that include non-market price based conditions;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' rights to withhold (or to deliver securities already owned)
to satisfy tax or exercise price obligations, and exempt cash settlement of such rights where granted pursuant to
exempt employee benefit plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Eliminate the transferability restrictions applicable to derivative securities issued under an employee
benefit plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also would simplify and clarify the reporting requirements by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permitting joint and group reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providing that Section 16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered
equity securities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eliminating officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to exempt transactions
and other transactions that are not matchable with a pre-termination transaction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring a discrete caption for the disclosure about delinquent Section 16(a) reports required by Item 405 of Regulations
S&hyph;K and S&hyph;B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Release also solicits comment on a variety of approaches to simplify the reporting of exempt transactions, including
elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5, proposals to replace Form 5 with alternative reporting schemes
(including a Form 10&hyph;K summary of insider transactions), and elimination of the requirement to report exempt
employee benefit plan transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposal would codify certain staff interpretive positions, and would establish new categories of
transactions exempt from short-swing recovery by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Expanded Exemptions for Broad-Based Plan Transactions and Intra-Plan Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal objection raised to the amended Section 16 rules has been that the treatment of thrift, stock purchase
and other broad-based, tax-qualified plans is unduly cumbersome, presents significant record-keeping problems,
and discourages insiders from participation in plan funds holding employer securities. These plans are subject
to significant restrictions under both the Internal Revenue Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the Employee Income Retirement Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which establish an objective framework for the treatment of compensatory transactions and impose extensive administrative
requirements, thereby making plan transactions less vulnerable to the abuses that the short-swing recovery provision
of Section 16(b) was designed to prevent. Accordingly, the proposed rules would streamline the conditions necessary
to exempt transactions in such plans from short-swing profit recovery. Comment is solicited not only on the proposals
set forth, but also on whether there is any other aspect of the treatment of employee benefit plans that should be modified,
either in Rule 16b&hyph;3 or any other rule relating to employee transactions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed below, the revised rule would exempt, without conditions as to timing, any purchase transaction arising
under a broad-based nondiscriminatory tax-qualified plan, other than an intra-plan transfer to or from an employer
securities fund.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed exemption would have a broader scope than the current rule, since it would be available not only to participant-directed
contributory plans, but also would apply specifically to related ``excess benefit'' or ``mirror'' plans and noncontributory
plans such as many employee stock ownership plans (``ESOPs'').
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The timing restrictions governing the exemption for transfers to or from an employer stock fund in any thrift, stock
purchase or similar plan, whether or not broad-based, nondiscriminatory and tax-qualified, would be more flexible.

Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(d) would replace Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(2) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(2)] in its entirety.
Other transactional exemptions currently available to participant-directed plans would continue to be available.
Current Rules 16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i) and (ii) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(d)(1)(i) and (ii)] are proposed to be moved to
Rules 16b&hyph;3(h) and (g), respectively. See Sections II.B. and II.H, below.

Under the proposal,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 all purchase transactions in a thrift, stock purchase or similar securities acquisition plan would be exempt if the
plan provides for broad-based employee participation, does not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees,
and is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In light of the requirement for broad-based participation, the proposed rule would exempt one-time acquisitions,
as well as ongoing acquisitions (such as regular purchases by payroll deduction pursuant to a thrift plan).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The exemption would apply whether the transaction results from an employer or an employee contribution.

Conforming changes are proposed to Rule 16b&hyph;3(c)(2)(i)(B) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(c)(2)(i)(B)], transaction
code B in Forms 4 and 5, and General Instruction 4(a)(ii) to Form 5 to reflect deletion of the requirement that the plan

The proposal would eliminate the exemptive requirement that insider participants who withdraw from a fund holding
equity securities of the employer (``employer securities fund'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
19
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 either cease further employer securities fund purchases for six months or hold the securities distributed for six
months.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Similarly, insider participants who stop participating in an employer securities fund no longer would be required
to refrain from further participation for six months.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The six-month holding period for securities offered without a fixed price under a stock purchase plan or similar plan
also would be eliminated.

benefit limits and nondiscrimination rules,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be sufficient to deter insiders from using such plans as vehicles for short-term speculation.

Such funds would include both funds composed entirely of equity securities of the employer and mixed equity funds

24
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 defined as a plan, operated in conjunction with a tax-qualified plan, that provides only the benefits or contributions

that replicates plans that are so regulated, and accordingly are unlikely to be vehicles for speculative abuse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters are requested to address whether it is necessary to limit the proposed purchase exemption to plans that
are qualified pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code. Are the conditions of the proposed rule that a plan be broad-based
and non-discriminatory sufficient safeguards? Does satisfaction of the minimum participation, minimum funding,
non-discrimination and vesting standards specifically imposed by the Internal Revenue Code provide additional
assurance that transactions pursuant to a plan will not be subject to abuse? Is the proposed exemption for excess benefit
plan transactions consistent with the theory that wide participation and equal treatment of all participating employees
limits insiders' opportunities to engage in short-swing speculation?

2. Intra-Plan Transfers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule would simplify and shorten the timing restriction that conditions the exemption for transfers
of funds in an employee plan to or from an employer securities fund (``fund-switching transaction''). As proposed,
any fund-switching transaction effected pursuant to an election made during any quarterly ``window period'' would
be exempt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Moreover, the exemption no longer would be limited to transfers at least six months apart. The requirement that the
election occur in the ``window period'' following the release of quarterly and annual financial data should provide
an adequate safeguard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As under the current rules, the exemption would be available whether or not the plan is broad-based, tax-qualified
and nondiscriminatory.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Finally, because of changes to the basic exemption for plan purchases discussed above, transferring assets out of
an employer securities fund would no longer trigger the requirement that the insider cease plan purchases for six
months.

statements of sales and earnings, and ending on the twelfth business day following such date.

Although the window period requirement reduces the likelihood that an insider possesses material information that
is not publicly available, the window period should not be considered a safe harbor from the prohibitions of Exchange
Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b&hyph;5 thereunder [15 U.S.C. 78j(b) and 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;5].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested as to whether the six month timing restriction between transfers should be retained, and, if
so, whether it should be limited to opposite way transactions, such as a transfer into an employer securities fund
followed by a transfer out of an employer securities fund. In addition, commenters should address whether requiring
that transactions be limited to every other window period, even if separated by a few days less than six months_rather
than requiring the transactions themselves to be six months apart_would alleviate difficulties in administering
the requirement while preventing opportunities for speculative abuse. Comment also is requested whether it would
be consistent with the statutory purpose to exempt fund-switching transactions without any timing restrictions.
In addressing these issues, commenters are asked to consider the manner in which the rule, as proposed, would function
in tandem with concurrently applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA regarding transfers.

Commenters' attention is directed particularly to the rules that became effective January 1, 1994 under Section
404(c) of ERISA [29 USC 1104(c)] that specify circumstances in which employee plan sponsors will not be subject to
fiduciary responsibility because investment decisions are made by plan participants. In order to benefit from the
rules, a plan must make a variety of investment vehicles available to plan participants and permit participants to
switch their investments among the different vehicles at a rate of frequency related to the volatility of the investment.
The latter requirement may dictate that a plan permit fund-switching transactions more frequently than every six
months.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the proposed rule would exempt any fund-switching transaction that results from a diversification
election satisfying the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, without regard to the ``window period'' timing
restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This would maintain the utility of the 90-day period following the close of the plan year specifically provided for
such transactions by the Internal Revenue Code
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

C. Compensatory Cash-Only Instruments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rules, the derivative security definition would be modified to provide a more expansive exclusion
for compensatory instruments that can be redeemed or exercised solely for cash (``cash-only instruments''),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
36
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 such as phantom stock. The proposed exclusion would apply to all cash-only instruments issued in the context of an
employer-employee compensation arrangement,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 including compensation arrangements between a company and its non-employee directors.

38
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Historically the purpose of such plans has been to provide performance-based cash compensation to employees, using
stock price as a measure of company performance, rather than to provide employees with an equity interest in the employer.

Commentators have cited a number of problems with using these types of performance-based plans arising from the 1991
rule changes. For example, change-in-control provisions and hardship withdrawal provisions could render the current
exclusion unavailable because the rights would not be redeemable only on a fixed date or dates at least six months following
the award. Given the difficulties that have arisen, and recognizing the historic role of stock return as a measure
for long-term cash-based incentive plans, the proposals would restore these plans to a status similar to that which
existed pre-1991.

Proposed Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment is requested on the necessity or appropriateness of the proposed exclusion for compensatory cash-only instruments.
Is there any basis for according disparate treatment, for reporting and/or short-swing profit purposes, to equity-based
securities depending on whether they are settled exclusively in cash or stock (or in either stock or cash), where both
types of derivative securities provide identical opportunities for profit predicated on the underlying stock price
movement? Commenters should focus in particular on the need for retention of one or both of the current, alternative
conditions to the availability of the exclusion (compliance with specified requirements of Rule 16b&hyph;3; fixed-date
redemption or exercise).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Alternatively, should the current exclusion for cash-only instruments be retained, with some relief provided for
hardship withdrawals or other specified exceptions? What impact, if any, would the proposed exclusion have on executive
and director stock-ownership programs that seek to align shareholder and managerial interests through awards of
issuer stock or derivative securities payable in stock?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Numerous interpretive questions, particularly in the employee benefit area, have been raised concerning the treatment
of performance units and similar instruments as derivative securities. To provide clarification, the proposed
rules would revise the definition of derivative security to codify the staff interpretive view that an instrument
is not within the scope of Section 16 if it includes a material non-market price based condition (such as return on equity)
to exercise or settlement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
42
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed, rights under which benefits are subject to a material condition (other than the passage of time or continued
employment) not tied to the market price of an equity security of the issuer would be excluded from the definition of
derivative security for purposes of Section 16.

E. Surrender and Withholding Rights in Connection With Exercise or Tax Withholding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employee benefit plans commonly provide participants with the right to have securities withheld, or to deliver securities
already owned, either in payment of the exercise price of an option or to satisfy the tax withholding consequences
of an option exercise or the vesting of restricted securities. While a tax withholding right currently is treated
as a derivative security separate from the equity or derivative security to which it relates,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it appears that this right, as well as the right to have securities withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price, properly
may be viewed as an integral feature of the related security.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, a newly proposed rule would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' these withholding
rights, as well as rights to surrender previously owned securities in satisfaction of either a tax obligation or an
exercise price.

Today, when withholding rights are exercised or securities delivered, the exemptive treatment of the exercise transactions
differs, depending on whether securities are withheld by or tendered to the employer. The delivery of previously
owned shares with respect to shares of the same class is exempt without further conditions except for compliance with

Rule 16b&hyph;3(e) would be amended to delete the clause that deems the cash settlement of a tax withholding right
to be a stock appreciation right. Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(2) would be amended to exempt withholding by the issuer, as well
as surrender or delivery to the issuer, of shares of its stock as payment for the exercise of a derivative security.
Similarly, proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(3) would be added to exempt the cash settlement of a tax withholding right,
either by withholding shares or the surrender of shares previously owned. The tax withholding right could be in connection
with an option exercise or the vesting of restricted shares. Transaction Code F would continue to be used for withholding
transactions, and would be expanded to cover the withholding and surrender of securities in connection with the vesting
of restricted shares. Proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(3) would be substituted for current Rule 16b&hyph;3(f)(3) [17
CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(f)(3)], which would be replaced substantively by proposed Rule 16b&hyph;5(b), as discussed

The current rule requires the issuer of the stock appreciation right to have been subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act for at least a year prior to the transaction, and to have filed all reports and statements
thereby required. Under the proposal, a one-year reporting history no longer would be required. Instead, the issuer
simply would have to have filed all required reports and statements for a year prior to the transaction, or such shorter
time as the issuer had been subject to Section 13(a).

1. Disinterested Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two amendments are proposed to the exemption of grant and award transactions based on disinterested administration
of the employee benefit plan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
51
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 First, the provision that permits a director to remain disinterested although he or she elects to receive in securities
``an annual retainer fee'' would be changed to permit receipt of ``a director's fee,'' thus broadening the term to
clarify that a meeting fee or other director's fee would be included.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
52
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, the requirement that the securities elected to be received constitute an ``equivalent amount'' to the cash
would be deleted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
53
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current requirement could impair companies' ability to provide directors with an adequate incentive to elect
the receipt of compensation in securities. Comment is requested, however, as to whether some limitation should remain
in order to assure that the director's receipt of stock is adequately linked to the fee, rather than a separate stock
grant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assure that objective criteria govern the making of awards under formula plans, the rule currently requires that
the plan itself restrict the frequency with which the terms of the formula may be amended to not more than once every
six months, with limited exceptions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
54
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the proposal, no written restriction would need to be placed in the plan. Instead, the rule would require that
the plan not be amended periodically and in no event more often than every six months, with the same exceptions as currently
permitted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
55
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Six Month Holding Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, the six-month holding period for securities obtained in a grant and award transaction would not
apply to securities disposed of in a transaction that is exempted by rule from Section 16(b), such as a bona fide gift.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
57
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, it is proposed that the six-month holding period for dividend equivalent rights (``DERs'') and shares
purchased pursuant to the reinvestment of dividends should be deemed to commence on the date of acquisition of the
shares on which the DERs or dividends are paid.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
58
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If adopted, should this treatment apply only to dividends and DERs paid at a rate that does not exceed dividends paid
on the issuer's common stock? Moreover, should this treatment be limited to dividends paid on a broadly held class
of securities, so that neither the timing nor the amount of dividend paid would be subject to manipulation by insiders?

H. Exemptions for Distributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, distributions to plan participants of securities acquired in an exempt manner under Rule 16b&hyph;3
are also exempt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
59
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As proposed, this exemption would be broadened so it would apply to all distributions of plan securities, whether
those securities were acquired pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;3, an exemption under the former rules, or in a nonexempt
manner.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
60
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such an exemption appears appropriate where these distributions merely change the form of the participant's beneficial
ownership, not its extent. Of course, if the participant then sells the securities, the sale would be subject to Section
16.

When a plan distributes the cash value of securities in participants' accounts, rather than the securities themselves,
such a distribution would be viewed as a sale. As proposed, the rule would expand the categories of exempt cash distributions
to plan participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, distributions of securities and cash, or the deferral of such distributions, incident to death, retirement,
disability or termination of employment, would be exempt.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
61
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order for a plan transaction to be exempt, the current rule requires that the plan set forth in writing the basis for
determining insider eligibility to participate, and either the price at which securities may be offered and the amount
of securities to be awarded or the method by which such price and amount are to be determined. Under the proposal,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
68
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

J. Transferability Restriction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the availability of exemptions is conditioned on a written specification, in the plan or other written
agreement, that a derivative security awarded under the plan may not be transferred by the participant other than
by will or the laws of descent and distribution, or pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
70
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The restriction on transferability initially was derived from the Internal Revenue Code as a reflection of prior
business practice and was designed to limit opportunities for the speculative abuse of options.

Rule 16b&hyph;3(a)(2) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;3(a)(2)]. By interpretation, plans that are not subject to I.R.C. Section
401(a) have been allowed to permit transfers of derivative securities pursuant to ``domestic relations orders''
that satisfy the requirements of I.R.C. Sections 414(p)(1) (A) and (B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, questions have been raised about whether this restriction needs to be retained, given the presence of other
safeguards in Rule 16b&hyph;3 and given the fact that the current Section 16 regulatory framework generally recognizes
economic parity between derivative securities and their underlying equity securities. Accordingly, the proposed
amendments to Rule 16b&hyph;3 would delete the transferability restriction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Commenters are asked to address whether there is any continuing need for this restriction, either in whole or in part,
and should address the extent to which nontransferability may act as a safeguard, both in Rule 16b&hyph;3 and in the
context of compensatory cash-only instruments as discussed above.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Of course, in many cases transferability restrictions would continue to exist because of Internal Revenue Code requirements
or companies' policies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assuming the restriction is retained but modified, would it be appropriate to recast it as a transactional requirement,
so that only derivative securities for which the exemption is claimed would need to satisfy this requirement?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
72
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Comment also is solicited on whether, if the restriction is retained, additional kinds of transfers should be permitted,
such as transfers to family members of insiders, family partnerships, charitable institutions, and trusts whose
beneficiaries are insiders and their families, or transfers by a non-employee director to a third party entity (such
as the director's law firm) without consideration pursuant to an agreement that provides that any compensation received
for the director's services is received for the benefit of that entity. Comment also is solicited on whether the rule
should permit only transfers that are exempt from short-swing profit recovery, such as bona fide gifts.

Options that satisfy the transferability restrictions currently may be issued on an exempt basis pursuant to a plan
that also issues on a non-exempt basis options that may be transferred, without consideration, to family members,
family trusts and family partnerships.

If transfers to family members and family entities are permitted, should these be limited to transfers for estate
planning purposes? Should such transfers be limited to persons or entities composed of persons who are members of
the insider's immediate family sharing the same household, such that the insider will retain an indirect pecuniary
interest in the derivative securities following the transfer,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
73
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and any subsequent disposition by the transferee would be attributed to the insider? Finally, comment is solicited
on the combined effect of liberalizing or eliminating transferability restrictions and the proposal, discussed
above, to provide that securities obtained in an exempt grant may be disposed of within six months if the disposition
is a gift or otherwise exempt from short-swing profit recovery. Should the rules provide that the six-month holding
period would continue to run in the hands of the transferee?

A. Reporting of Exempt Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is reconsidering its approach to the reporting of transactions pursuant to the Section 16 regulatory
scheme. Under the current rules, transactions exempt from short-swing profit recovery (other than exempt exercises
and conversions of derivative securities) must be reported annually.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
74
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Reporting of exempt transactions has been required to provide interested parties with the opportunity to evaluate
insiders' claims to exemptions; facilitate reconciliation of insiders' holdings at the end of the fiscal year; and
provide indications of insiders' views of their corporations' prospects, although annual reporting generally
is permitted since these transactions are viewed as having less potential than non-exempt transactions to reflect
insiders' investment assessments of their corporations.

The Commission has received various suggestions that would further streamline Section 16(a) reporting. These proposals
seek to simplify reporting through different basic approaches. One approach would delete or substantially reduce
the reporting of exempt transactions. A second approach would not reduce significantly the reportable transactions,
but rather would reduce the flexibility provided insiders with respect to using Form 4 or Form 5 to report a number of
exempt transactions. A third approach would introduce issuer annual reporting of insider holdings and information
as to transactions during the fiscal year. These proposals highlight several questions as to what extent, if at all,
investors need information with respect to exempt transactions and whether investors need a reconciliation of insiders'
equity holdings from year to year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suggestions received by the Commission include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Elimination of the requirement to report exempt transactions, or certain classes of exempt transactions, such
as exempt employee benefit plan transactions;

Many of these transactions currently may be reported on an aggregated basis, as of the most recent date for which plan
information is available. Aggregated reporting also is permitted, by staff interpretation, for acquisitions and
holdings resulting from reinvestment of dividends or interest in exempt transactions, and acquisitions of dividend
equivalent rights in exempt employee benefit plan transactions.

2. Replacement of annual reporting on Form 5 with a table to be included in the issuer's Form 10&hyph;K annual report
disclosing and reconciling transactions and insiders' holdings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4. Replacement of annual reporting on Form 5 with a requirement that each Form 4 filed include information with respect

5. Elimination of the total holdings column in Forms 4 and 5 (which the current rules limit to the class of securities
with respect to which a transaction is reported), or simplification of the reconciling data for such columns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is interested in obtaining the least burdensome reporting system that will effectively achieve the
disclosure purposes of Section 16(a), and therefore solicits comment on each of the above proposals. While the above
changes are not included in the text of the proposals published today, the Commission may adopt any of the alternatives
specified above, or a combination of those alternatives, and also may in the final rule amendments incorporate any
one or more of the approaches discussed above. Comment is solicited as to whether each of these suggested changes would
simplify the reporting obligations on insiders without materially reducing the flow of information that is significant
to investors. If the total holdings column is retained, comment also is requested as to whether any reconciling information
could be eliminated. Additionally, comment is solicited as to whether a new column should be added to Forms 4 and 5 requiring
insiders to reconcile their current holdings with those reported on the previous report. Would this reconciliation
requirement be appropriate only if reporting of exempt transactions were eliminated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, commenters recommending the elimination of Form 5 should address the mechanism by which information
that currently is reportable only on an annual basis should be reported. Commenters also are asked to address whether
Form 5 has continuing usefulness in reducing reporting delinquencies, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
76
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and, if so, what mechanism could serve this purpose if Form 5 were rescinded. In particular, what mechanism would enable
issuers to determine, in connection with their disclosure obligations under Item 405 of Regulation S&hyph;K and
S&hyph;B, whether all required Section 16(a) reports had been filed?

Although the current reporting scheme generally requires transactions exempt from short-swing profit recovery
to be reported annually, certain transactions, such as stock splits and stock dividends, are exempt from the reporting
requirement. The Commission proposes to eliminate the reporting requirement for the exempt cancellation or expiration
of a long derivative security where no value is received.

Finally, a new transaction code K would be added to Forms 4 and 5 to report any transaction that changes only the form
of beneficial ownership and not the extent of a reporting person's pecuniary interest in the subject securities.
Such transactions are reportable on Form 5, but the code also would be added to Form 4 so it could be used for voluntary
reporting on that form. Comment is requested as to whether any additional codes need to be added, or whether any existing
codes may be deleted, consistent with the informational needs of persons who use Section 16(a) disclosure.

B. Reporting of Small Acquisitions and Option Exercises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At present, small acquisitions of equity securities and exercises and conversions of derivative securities are
reported on an insider's next otherwise required Form 4 or Form 5, whichever is earlier.
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 No change currently is proposed to the existing system of reporting these transactions, other than amendment of the
small acquisitions reporting rule
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 to exclude from the $10,000 threshold acquisitions occurring within the prior six months of the current acquisition
that were exempted by rule from Section 16(b) or previously reported on Form 4 or 5, and to clarify that the current acquisition
cannot be disregarded in calculating the $10,000 threshold. Comment also is solicited as to whether reporting would
be made more convenient for insiders, consistent with the informational needs of other investors, by permitting
small acquisitions and exempt exercises and conversions to be reported solely on Form 5; or by providing that small
acquisitions be reported on Form 5 and exempt exercises and conversions be reported on Form 4.

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The timing for reporting exercises and conversions was expedited from the proposed annual reporting in response
to commenters' concerns, particularly the concerns of individual investors that option exercises represent important
indicia of insiders' views of their companies' prospects. If a derivative security is exercised or converted before
its exempt grant otherwise must be reported, the grant should be reported at the same time as the exercise or conversion.

Proposed Rule 16a&hyph;6. This rule provides only a deferral, not an exemption from reporting. All small acquisitions,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, when an insider exercises an option acquired pursuant to a Rule 16b&hyph;3 plan and immediately sells
a portion of the shares to pay the exercise price under a cashless exercise program, the transaction generally is reported
on Form 4 or 5 as the exercise of a derivative security and sale of a non-derivative security.
<FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is solicited as to whether insiders should be either required or permitted to reflect the sale of the portion
of shares necessary to satisfy the exercise price by using the transaction code for payment of an option exercise price
by delivery or withholding of securities,
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 rather than the general sale of security code currently used, since all of these transactions constitute cashless
exercises. In addition, comment is solicited as to whether this transaction code also should be used in connection
with the exercise of stock appreciation rights.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, when more than one person subject to Section 16 is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same equity securities,
all such persons must report as beneficial owners and file separate reports. To reduce this duplicative reporting,
the proposed rules would permit such persons to file their reports either separately or jointly.

Proposed Rules 16a&hyph;3(i) and 16a&hyph;1(a)(3) would reflect this change. Forms 3, 4 and 5 and the Instructions
thereto also would be modified to permit joint and group filings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, where persons in a group have reporting obligations, the filing of collective reports on behalf
of all group members would be permitted.
<FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>
 Such joint and group filings, and any amendments, could be submitted by any designated constituent beneficial owner.
Required information would have to be given for each beneficial owner, and such filings would have to be signed by,
or on behalf of, each beneficial owner by an authorized person, with statements confirming the delegation of signature
authority attached to the filing. Beneficial owners making a joint or group filing could authorize one of the beneficial
owners or a third party to sign on their behalf, provided that confirming statements are attached to the filing, or
are provided by amendment as soon as practicable, with respect to each owner delegating signature authority, unless
such a confirmation still in effect is on file with the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>85</FOOTCITE>
 Of course, to the extent a sufficiently broad power of attorney previously had been filed, such as with a Schedule 13D,
that power of attorney could be incorporated by reference in a Section 16(a) filing. Each beneficial owner would,
of course, retain individual liability for compliance with the filing requirements, including the obligation to
assure that the filing is timely and accurately made.
<FOOTCITE>86</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is solicited as to whether, in the alternative, authority to make a group Section 16 filing could be presumed
based on the filing of a group Schedule 13D,
<FOOTCITE>87</FOOTCITE>
 such that all group members thereby would be deemed to have granted authority to any group member to file a Section 16
form.

Joint and group filings could be used, for example, by parents and subsidiaries, partnerships, or Schedule 13D groups
[17 CFR 240.13d&hyph;101]. The group itself is not a reporting person for Section 16 purposes; however, under the
proposed rules, group members could choose to file collective reports to satisfy their individual filing obligations.
A group member is not required to report transactions by another group member, however, unless he or she has or shares
a pecuniary interest in the securities acquired or disposed of by such other member.

D. Trust Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today, a trust is subject to Section 16 not only if it beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered
equity securities,
<FOOTCITE>88</FOOTCITE>
 but also if the trustee otherwise is an insider and has investment control over the issuer's securities held by the
trust, and the trustee or a member of the trustee's immediate family has a pecuniary interest in such securities, except
in limited circumstances. This dual standard, newly established under the rules adopted in 1991, created a new reporting
obligation for some trusts, particularly family trusts where the insiders already were required to report most of
the trust transactions involved.

Since the primary effect of the new standard was to create duplicative reporting obligations, imposing independent
Section 16 obligations on the trusts does not appear necessary. Accordingly, the proposed rules would eliminate
these overlapping obligations by subjecting a trust to Section 16 only if it holds more than ten percent of a class of
registered equity securities of the issuer.

Duplicative reporting also can result because in certain instances the trust and a trust beneficiary must report
separately with respect to the same transaction. Accordingly, a proposed new note would provide that transactions
attributed to a trust beneficiary may be reported by the trustee on behalf of the beneficiary.

E. Post-Termination Reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the current rules, any transaction following the cessation of director or officer status is required to be reported,
if executed within six months of a transaction that occurred while the person was a director or officer. However, it
appears that the record-keeping burdens of tracking post-termination transactions should be imposed only with
respect to those transactions where short-swing profit liability is likely. Accordingly, the proposal would eliminate
insiders' post-termination reporting obligations with respect to post-termination transactions that are exempt
and thus not subject to matching with pre-termination transactions.
<FOOTCITE>92</FOOTCITE>
 Similarly, a post-termination transaction would not be required to be reported unless it occurred within six months
of an opposite (purchase vs. sale), non-exempt transaction that was effected while the reporting person was an officer
or director.
<FOOTCITE>93</FOOTCITE>
 Comment is requested as to the continuing need to report these transactions. In particular, is it necessary to continue
to require reporting of exempt post-termination transactions to assure that an exemption properly may be claimed?

F. Compliance With the Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the adoption of the 1991 revisions to the Section 16 rules and forms, including issuer disclosure concerning
insider compliance and annual reporting of exempt transactions, compliance with Section 16(a) reporting obligations
generally has improved substantially.
<FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission does not propose to change the disclosure requirements of Item 405 of Regulations S&hyph;B
and S&hyph;K, which requires issuer disclosure concerning insider compliance with these reporting obligations,
except that registrants would be required to set off any disclosure of non-compliance under an appropriate and discrete
caption.
<FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>
 This should enable interested parties to locate quickly this disclosure, which often consists of only a sentence
or two, and to prevent it from being buried among unrelated disclosure.

During 1990, the year before the new rules were adopted, approximately 21 percent of the reportable market transactions
were reported more than three days following the due date. From May 1991 through March 1994, the comparable figure
was approximately five percent.

The caption would read: ``Section 16(a) Reporting Delinquencies.'' Additionally, a technical amendment to Item
405 of Regulation S&hyph;B would correct the reference to Rule 16a&hyph;3(d) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;3(d)] by replacing
it with a reference to Rule 16a&hyph;3(e) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;3(e)].

In addition, Item 405 would be revised to clarify the nature of the issuer's obligation to review insiders' filings
in order to determine whether there are any delinquent reports that must be disclosed. The issuer is entitled to rely
on the Forms 3, 4, and 5 furnished to it, as well as written representations by the insider that no Form 5 is required.
New language would be added to make it clear that the issuer is obligated to consider the absence of certain forms.
<FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>
 The absence of a Form 3 from an insider is an indication that disclosure is required. Similarly, the absence of a Form
5 from an insider is an indication that disclosure is required, unless the issuer has received a written representation
that no Form 5 is required,
<FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>
 or the issuer otherwise knows that no such filing is required.

Further, comment is solicited on whether Item 405 should be revised to require issuers to include in their filings
an affirmative statement that there were no Section 16(a) delinquencies required to be reported, if such is the case.
<FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>
 It has been suggested that there are instances where required disclosures are not made because Item 405 is overlooked.
An affirmative statement of the absence of reportable delinquencies has been proposed to the Commission as a potential
tool for minimizing this problem. Commenters should address whether the problem suggested does in fact exist, and,
if so, whether the proposed solution would be effective.

Finally, the Commission is aware of and encourages the practice of many issuers to assist their officers and directors
in complying with their Section 16(a) reporting obligations. Since the use of powers of attorney is permitted, it
is also possible for an issuer to coordinate the filing of its officers' and directors' reports by having the corporate
secretary or other agent obtain powers of attorney from these reporting persons, and act on their behalf to collect
information every month about their transactions subject to Section 16 and make the filings by the due date.

G. Equity Swaps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have been asked concerning the proper method of reporting equity swaps for purposes of Section 16. Equity
swaps are individually negotiated contracts in which the specific terms may vary from agreement to agreement. For
instance, an equity swap may take the form of an agreement in which one party holding shares of equity securities agrees
to pay, or ``swap,'' the return
<FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>
 on those securities in exchange for the return on an equity index, basket of equities, or an interest rate-based cash
flow. Section 16 consequences would arise from such a transaction where either party to the transaction is a Section
16 insider with respect to a security to which the swap agreement relates.
<FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
100
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this analysis, ``return'' may include dividends paid on the equity instrument, as well as change in
market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
101
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
No Section 16 consequences would flow from the transaction to the extent that the swap relates solely to interests
in securities comprising part of a broad-based, publicly traded market basket or index of stocks, approved for trading
by the appropriate federal governmental authority, that are deemed not to confer beneficial ownership for purposes
of Section 16 pursuant to Rule 16a&hyph;1(a)(5)(iii) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(a)(5)(iii)] and/or are excluded from
the definition of ``derivative securities'' pursuant to Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(4) [17 CFR 240.16a&hyph;1(c)(4)].

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to demonstrate how Section 16 would apply,
<FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>
 assume that an insider agrees to pay to the counterparty for a period of three years the value of dividend payments on
100,000 shares of issuer common stock, in exchange for payment of a fixed interest rate based on the market value of
the 100,000 shares of stock at the commencement of the swap term. The parties also agree that at the end of the swap term,
the insider will pay to the counterparty the cash value of any appreciation on the shares during the term, or, conversely,
the counterparty will pay to the insider the cash value of any depreciation. The insider retains title to and any voting
rights in the securities.
<FOOTCITE>103</FOOTCITE>

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
This analysis addresses solely the application of Section 16 to these transactions to the extent that they are engaged
in by insiders. The discussion does not analyze the status of these transactions or the parties thereto under any other
provision of the federal securities laws.

It is not necessary, however, that either party to any equity swap have direct ownership of the underlying equity securities,
index or basket. Rather, equity swaps may provide insiders with a synthetic means of realizing any changes in the value
of the equity securities to which the swap agreement relates. For example, an insider may engage in a swap in which the
insider contracts to receive any change in value of the issuer's common stock without making any direct investment
in such stock.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It appears that the following reporting scheme appropriately reflects the economic impact of the transaction on
the insider. The insider should report entering into the swap on Form 4 as (i) the sale or writing of a stock appreciation
right (``SAR''), and (ii) the purchase of a stock depreciation right (``SDR'').
<FOOTCITE>104</FOOTCITE>
 This result would reflect the fact that the insider has locked in the value of the 100,000 shares during the swap term
to the same extent as if the shares had been sold.
<FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The result would be a sale of the underlying securities pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;6(a) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;6(a)]
because the insider engaging in the swap has an increase in a put equivalent position.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The manner in which an insider reports the closing of the swap would depend on the change in price of the underlying securities
during the swap term.
<FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>
 If the price increases, so that the insider must pay cash to the counterparty, the insider should report the exempt
expiration without value of the SDR.
<FOOTCITE>107</FOOTCITE>
 The insider also should report on Form 4 the exempt exercise by the counterparty of the SAR, the insider's exempt deemed
disposition of the underlying securities to the counterparty pursuant to the SAR, and the insider's non-exempt deemed
re-acquisition of the underlying securities.

Because the SDR would be a long derivative security in the hands of the insider as holder, this expiration would be exempt
from short-swing profit recovery pursuant to Rule 16b&hyph;6(d). Although proposed Rule 16a&hyph;4(e), discussed
above in the text accompanying note 78, would exempt the expiration from reporting as well, in the context of an equity
swap such an expiration should be reported because it is an integral component of the overall transaction.

Rule 16b&hyph;6(b) [17 CFR 240.16b&hyph;6(b)] would exempt the first two components of the exercise of the SAR because

If the price decreases, so that the insider receives cash from the counterparty, the insider should report the expiration
of the SAR.

 The insider also should report on Form 4 the exercise of the SDR as the simultaneous exempt disposition of a put derivative

The current rules limit the exemption for the disposition of securities pursuant to a qualified domestic relations

C. Over-Allotment Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Questions have arisen as to whether an over-allotment option written by an insider could be characterized as the establishment
of a put equivalent position and deemed sale of the underlying stock. Subsequent expiration of the unexercised option
arguably could constitute a purchase of the underlying security, matchable with the over-allotment option grant
or other sales by the insider within a six-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recognizing that over-allotment options facilitate public offerings and do not lend themselves to the speculative
abuse Section 16 was designed to prevent, the staff issued interpretive relief to prevent this unintended result.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
117
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal would codify this relief by explicitly excluding over-allotment options from the derivative security
definition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
118
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Of course, a sale of securities to an underwriter upon exercise of the over-allotment option would remain a sale for
Section 16 purposes. Comment is solicited on whether additional conditions should be placed on the exclusion, such
as requiring that the option comply with all applicable regulations and policies of the National Association of Securities
Dealers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on the proposed revisions to the Commission's Section 16
rules and forms, and compliance disclosure requirements, as well as on other matters that might have an impact on the
proposals contained herein, is requested to do so. In addition, the Commission requests comment on whether any further
changes to the Section 16 rules, particularly Rule 16b&hyph;3, are necessary or appropriate at this time. Comment
is requested specifically from persons subject to Section 16; issuers whose officers, directors and ten percent
shareholders are subject to Section 16; and persons using the information afforded by the Section 16(a) reports.
The Commission also requests comment on whether the proposed rules, if adopted, would have an adverse impact on competition
or would impose a burden on competition that is neither necessary nor appropriate in furthering the purposes of the
Exchange Act. Comments responsive to this inquiry will be considered by the Commission in complying with its responsibilities
under Section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

VI. Transition to New Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the proposed rule revisions are adopted, provisions for a transition from the current rules will be necessary,
particularly with respect to proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3. Although the discussion below represents the Commission's
current intent regarding transition to the proposed revised rules, this schedule is subject to modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission intends to make the proposed rule amendments, other than those to Rule 16b&hyph;3, effective with
respect to reports that are, or would have been, due on or after the 45th day following the date of adoption (the ``Effective
Date''), with earlier compliance permitted. Of course, to the extent that proposed rules codify interpretive positions,
those positions continue to be valid before the Effective Date. Trusts currently subject to Section 16 that would
be relieved of Section 16 obligations under the proposed rules would not be subject to any post-termination reporting
obligations or required to file a final Form 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In extending the phase-in period for current Rule 16b&hyph;3, the Commission stated that this period would continue
until September 1, 1994, or such earlier date as set in further rulemaking under Section 16. Given the timing of these
rule proposals, the Commission is extending the phase-in date until September 1, 1995 or such different date as set
in further rulemaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
120
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current and former Rule 16b&hyph;3 would remain available until September 1, 1995,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
121
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unless a different date is set by the Commission in the adopting release. Comment is solicited on how long a transition
period issuers and insiders would need, assuming adoption of the proposals. Of course, issuers continue to be permitted
to convert their plans to current Rule 16b&hyph;3 at any time, provided that all plans of the issuer are converted.
After the phase-in date, issuers and insiders will no longer be able to rely on the former employee benefit plan exemptions,
but instead will need to comply with current Rule 16b&hyph;3 (modified to the extent the Commission adopts these rule
proposals).

Because proposed Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(8), which would exclude from the definition of ``derivative security'' the
right or obligation to surrender a security or to have a security withheld in satisfaction of an exercise price or tax
withholding obligation, is inextricably linked to the proposed amendment of Rule 16b&hyph;3(e), the Commission
proposes to link the availability of proposed Rule 16a&hyph;1(c)(8) to conversion of the plan to proposed Rule 16b&hyph;3.

VII. Cost-Benefit Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters are requested to provide their views and data to assist the Commission in evaluating the costs and benefits
associated with the proposed amendments. It is expected that the amendments would decrease significantly the compliance
burden imposed on persons subject to Section 16 and attendant costs without undercutting the statutory objectives
of disclosing information concerning insider trading and discouraging speculative short-term insider trading.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed simplification of the treatment of employee benefit plan transactions would constitute the most important
reduction in compliance burden. The proposed rules also would reduce compliance costs by: permitting joint and group
reporting where more than one person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities; providing that Section
16 applies to a trust only if the trust beneficially owns more than ten percent of a class of registered equity securities;
and limiting officers' and directors' post-termination reporting obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the proposed rules would expand the exemption for stock splits and stock dividends to include stock
dividends in which securities of a different issuer are distributed, and would provide a general exemption from reporting
and short-swing profit recovery for the disposition of securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order.

VIII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 concerning the proposed
amendments. The analysis notes that the proposed amendments are intended to simplify the Section 16 regulatory scheme,
particularly with respect to employee benefit plans, and codify several staff interpretive positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed more fully in the analysis, most of the reporting persons the proposed amendments would affect are small
entities, as defined by the Commission's rules. The proposed amendments would decrease the reporting and compliance
requirements imposed upon corporate insiders subject to Section 16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis discusses several possible alternatives to the proposed amendments including, among others, establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities or exempting them from all or part of the proposed
requirements. As discussed more fully in the analysis, implementation of any of these alternatives either would
be duplicative of the proposed amendments or inconsistent with the Exchange Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are encouraged on any aspect of the analysis. A copy of the analysis may be obtained by contacting Elizabeth
Murphy, Office of Disclosure Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450
Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This computer matching program is being initiated as part of an effort by USDA to increase the collection of overissued
food stamp benefits. These overissued benefits are benefits which households received but to which they were not
entitled. As part of their responsibility for administering the Food Stamp Program, State agencies are responsible
for establishing claims for these overissued benefits and for taking certain steps to try to collect those claims.
This computer match will provide otherwise unavailable information which State agencies can use to try to collect
delinquent food stamp claims owed by USPS employees and if necessary, which USDA can use to collect such claim by involuntarily
offsetting USPS employee salaries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Participating agencies:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recipient agency is USPS. The source agency is USDA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Beginning and ending dates:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The matching program will begin in November 1994 and continue in effect no longer than 18 months (April 30, 1996). If
within three months of that date, the Data Integrity Boards of both USDA and the USPS find that the matching program
can be conducted without change and both USDA and the USPS certify that the matching program has been conducted in compliance
with the matching agreement, the matching program may be extended for one additional year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose of the match:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to providing information to assist in collecting food stamp recipient delinquent debts, the names of
USPS employees identified through this matching program will be removed from lists of delinquent debts being referred
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for collection from Federal income tax refunds. This action is required to conform
to an IRS requirement for the tax offset program. (A description of the Federal income tax refund offset program for
the Food Stamp Program is contained in a General Notice dated August 20, 1991 at 56 FR 41325&hyph;31.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of the match:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The subject matching program will involve several steps. USDA will provide USPS a magnetic computer tape of claims
submitted by State agencies participating in the Federal tax offset program. By computer, USPS will compare that
information with its payroll file, establishing matched individuals on the basis of Social Security Numbers (SSN's).
For each matched individual, the USPS will provide to USDA the individual's name, SSN, home address, date of birth,
work location, and employee type (permanent or temporary).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USDA will prepare lists of matched individuals according to the State agencies which established the claim for the
overissued benefits and will distribute the State lists accordingly. The respective State agencies will verify
identity and debtor status of the matched individuals by manually comparing those list of matched individuals to
their records on the debts, by conducting independent inquiries when necessary to resolve questionable identities,
and by reviewing the records of payments to determine whether or not the debt is still delinquent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to verifying debtor identity and the status of the debt, prior to USDA taking any steps to effect involuntary
offset of USPS employee salaries, State agencies will provide debtors with a 30-day written notice stating the amount
of the debt and that the debtor may repay it voluntarily by entering into a written agreement with the State agency.
Debts not repaid voluntarily would be referred to USDA for involuntary salary offset. Prior to such action, debtors
would be notified and offered an opportunity for a hearing on the debt, including the right to copy documentation relating
to the debt.

the Debt Collection Act;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) USDA regulations at 7 CFR part 3, subpart C, which implement 5 U.S.C. 5514 and OPM regulations, and which authorize
USDA agencies to issue regulations governing debt collection by salary offset (7 CFR 3.68); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 13941 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66), which amended sections
11(e) (8) and 13 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977, 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(8), 2022, to authorize the Federal salary offset program
for the Food Stamp Program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Categories of individuals involved:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two groups of individuals will be involved with this matching program. One group is USPS employees. The other is individuals
who have participated in the Food Stamp Program but are no longer participating, and who owe delinquent debts for overissued
food stamp benefits for which they are not making repayments. This group is further defined in that the individuals
owe only delinquent debts resulting from inadvertent household errors and intentional Program violations. Individuals
owing claims due to State agency administrative errors will be excluded (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(8)(C)).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The USDA, Forest Service, Tahoe National Forest and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit are preparing a Legislative
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to determine the suitability or non-suitability of the approximately 58.8
miles (revised from previously published 61 miles) of eight eligible streams and rivers on the Tahoe National Forest
and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. In addition to the
Wild and Scenic River suitability analysis, the EIS will evaluate the environmental effects of possible Special
Interest Area designation, a Forest Service Administrative designation, as an alternative to Wild and Scenic River
designation. Lynn Sprague, Regional Forester, Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service, 630 Sansome Street,
San Francisco, California 94111, is the responsible official for Special Interest Area designation. Michael Espy,
Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 200&hyph;A, Adm. Bldg., Washington, D.C. 20250,
is the responsible official for recommendations for wild and scenic river designation.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) to evaluate the environmental impacts
of including suitable segments of North Fork, South Fork and Mills Rivers classified as wild, scenic, or recreational
rivers in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The decision to recommend the nomination of suitable river segments
to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System rests with the Secretary of Agriculture. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act
(PL 90&hyph;542) reserves to Congress the authority to include rivers in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency invites written comments on the suitability of these rivers and recommendations related to classifying
and including them in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. In addition, the agency gives notice of the full environmental
analysis and decision making process that has been occurring on the proposal so that interested and affected people
are aware of how they may participate and contribute to the final decision. The Supervisor of the National Forests
in North Carolina is responsible for the preparation of the EIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1982, the Nationwide River Inventory developed by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of Interior, identified
South Fork and Mills River as potential wild and scenic study rivers. The 1987 Final Environmental Impact Statement
(FEIS) for the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Nantahala and Pisgah National Forests determined South Fork
and Mills River to be eligible for designation with potential wild and recreational classifications for different
segments of South Fork and recreational for Mills River. (That information and additional findings will be documented
in this environmental impact statement.) The rivers were determined to be potentially suitable for designation
pending further study. A follow-up study to the Forest Plan FEIS was begun in 1989. At the request of local citizens,
through a North Carolina Congressional Delegate, North Fork was added to the study area. In November 1990, Public
Law 101&hyph;538 was passed by Congress which designated 34.8 miles of the Mills River System (North Fork, South Fork
and Mills Rivers) as a Wild and Scenic Study River. This Act excluded the segment of the Mills River from the confluence
of the French Broad River to a point 750 feet upstream from the centerline of N.C. Highway 191/280.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Impact Statement will consider the following river segments:

The area of consideration for each stream is a corridor a minimum of 1/4 mile from each stream bank for the entire length
of the study segment. These corridors include both public and private lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant issues identified during initial scoping include the potential for future dams along these rivers based
on past proposals for impoundments, the effects of designation on private lands, and protection of the free-flowing
condition and resource values of these rivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A range of alternatives will be developed based on issues and concerns raised during the study process. As a minimum,
one alternative will maintain current management with a recommendation of nondesignation for the three rivers (the
no action alternative). Other potential alternatives include: 1. Recommend designation for all eligible segments.
2. Recommend designation or nondesignation for specific segments of each river based on identified issues and 3.
Recommend designation of eligible segments with different classifications (wild, scenic, recreational) based
on identified issues. The environmental impact statement will disclose the direct, indirect, and cumulative effects
of implementing each alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation is important at several points during the analysis process. The first point was the scoping
process (40 CFR 1501.7). The scoping process includes, but is not limited to: (1) Identifying potential issues, (2)
identifying issues to be analyzed in depth, (3) eliminating insignificant issues or those that have been covered
by a relevant previous environmental analysis, (4) exploring additional alternatives, and (5) identifying potential
(direct, indirect, and cumulative) environmental effects of the alternatives.

During the scoping process, the Forest Service sought information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State,
and local agencies and individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposal. News releases
were published in local newspapers; individual letters were distributed to government agencies, organizations,
landowners along the rivers and individuals assumed to be interested in this action; and several meetings were held
in the local community along the rivers. Informal contacts through phone calls and visits have also occurred throughout
the study. Additional mailings and media releases will occur when the Draft EIS and Final EIS are completed and available
for public review.

The responsible official is Mike Espy, Secretary of Agriculture, Administration Bldg., 12th Street and Jefferson

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft Environmental Impact Statement is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and available for public review by August 1994. The comment period on the draft environmental impact statement will
be 45 days from the date the EPA publishes the Notice of Availability in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. Upon release of the draft environmental impact
statement, projected for August 1994, reviewers must structure their participation in the environmental review
of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposal participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the Final
Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the proposed action, comments
on the draft environmental impact statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages and chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the draft environmental
impact statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. (Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions at the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the comment period ends on the draft environmental impact statement, the comments will be analyzed and considered
by the Forest Service in preparing the Final Environmental Impact Statement. The final statement is scheduled to
be completed by March 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of Agriculture will consider comments, responses, and environmental consequences discussed in the
final environmental impact statement and applicable laws, regulations, and policies in making his recommendation
to the President regarding the suitability of these rivers for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.
The decision on the inclusion of a river in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System rests with the United States Congress.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (``the Department'') is postponing its preliminary determinations in the antidumping
duty investigations of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Russian Federation
(Russia), and pure magnesium from Ukraine. The deadline for issuing these preliminary determinations is now no later
than October 27, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 20, 1994, the Department initiated antidumping duty investigations of pure and alloy magnesium from the
PRC, Russia, and Ukraine (59 FR 21748, April 26, 1994). The notice stated that we would issue our preliminary determinations
on September 7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 16, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission determined that there was not a likelihood that a U.S. domestic
industry was materially injured, nor threatened with material injury, by reason of imports of alloy magnesium from
Ukraine, thereby terminating the investigation of alloy magnesium from Ukraine. With regard to pure and alloy magnesium
from the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation and pure magnesium from Ukraine, the ITC found that
there was a reasonable indication that an industry in the U.S. is materially injured, or threatened with material
injury, by reason of imports of pure and alloy magnesium from the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation
and pure magnesium from Ukraine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined that the remaining investigations are extraordinarily complicated within the meaning of section
733(c)(1)(B)(i) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(2). Given the non-market
economy status of all countries subject to these investigations, the nature of government ownership of the participating
companies must be clarified for each country. Additionally, these investigations involve unusually complex foreign
trading channels as well as possible sales from foreign government stockpiles. Furthermore, we have determined
that the parties concerned are cooperating, as required by section 733(c)(1)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(1),
and that additional time is necessary to make these preliminary determinations in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(ii)
of the Act and 19 CFR 353.15(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, the deadline for issuing these determinations is now no later than October 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Imports charged to this category limit for the period September 1, 1993 through August 31, 1994 shall be charged against

established in this directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for

<DOCTITLE>Public Scoping Meeting for Disposal and Reuse of Gentile AFS, OH </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Air Force (AF) will conduct a public scoping meeting to provide a forum for public officials and the
community to provide information and comments concerning the disposal and reuse of portions of Gentile AFS, OH. The
meeting will be held September 14, 1994 beginning at 7 p.m. at the Kettering City Hall, 3600 Shroyer Road, Kettering,
Ohio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this meeting is to identify the environmental issues and concerns that should be analyzed to support
base disposal and reuse, and solicit potential disposal and reuse alternatives for consideration in developing
the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). In soliciting disposal and reuse alternatives, the AF will consider all
reasonable alternatives offered by any federal, state, or local government agency, and any federally-sponsored
or private entity or individual. The resulting EIS will be considered in making disposal decisions that will be documented
in the Air Force's Final Disposal Plan and Record of Decision for Gentile AFS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure sufficient time to adequately consider public comments concerning environmental issues and disposal
alternatives to be included in the EIS, the AF recommends that comments and reuse proposals be presented at the upcoming
meeting or forwarded to the address below by December 1, 1994. The AF will, however, accept additional comments at
any time during the environmental impact analysis process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please direct written comments or requests for further information concerning the base disposal and reuse EIS to:
William Myers, 8106 Chennault Road, Brooks AFB TX 78235&hyph;5318, (210) 536&hyph;3860.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action implements the July 1993 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's (BRAC 93) decision
to realign all Department of Army personnel and missions out of the leased U.S. Army Communications-Electronics
Command (CECOM) Office Building (Tinton Falls, New Jersey) and the Evans subpost (which is closing) onto the main
post or Charles Wood subpost of Fort Monmouth. Personnel and missions from Vint Hill Farms Station (VHFS) in Warrenton,
Virginia, will also be moved onto the main post or Charles Wood subpost as part of this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since not all personnel can be accommodated in existing buildings, new facilities will be constructed. Actions to
implement this realignment include the construction of up to 7 new buildings, demolition of 5 buildings, and renovation
of 15 buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives considered in the EA included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 1: Consists of the following projects:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Construction of a 16,000-square foot Intelligence and Electronic Warfare Directorate (IEWD) complex at main post.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Construction of a 3,250-square foot calibration range laboratory at the Charles Wood subpost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Construction of a 2,600-square foot high bay facility at the Charles Wood subpost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Renovation of 14 main post buildings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Renovation of portions of the Myer Center (Building 2700) at the Charles Wood subpost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative 2: Alternative construction sites were identified on the Charles Wood subpost for the IEWD complex,
the calibration range laboratory, and the high bay facility. No reasonable alternative to the building renovations
at main post and the Charles Wood subpost of Fort Monmouth were identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 3: The No-Action Alternative. This alternative is the continuation of existing conditions without
the implementation of, or in absence of, the proposed actions. The proposed actions are required by BRAC law and must
be implemented. Therefore, the No-Action Alternative is being evaluated to provide a baseline for the other alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative 2 was not selected for implementation based on the potential for significant environmental, biological
and cultural resources impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the preferred alternative (Alternative 1) will not substantially alter baseline environmental
conditions. Biological, physical, and cultural resources will not be impacted by the preferred alternative because
construction sites for new buildings are located in previously disturbed areas. The increase in the workforce at
Fort Monmouth will be largely off-set by the workforce decreases that will result from scheduled non-BRAC realignments
and Department of Defense downsizing. This workforce decrease offsets potential impacts on infrastructure such
as water, wastewater, solid waste and energy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed realignment is expected to have an insignificant impact on the socioeconomic environment, including
total sales, employment, population and income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the EA, which is incorporated into the FNSI, it has been determined that implementation of the proposed action
would have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the natural or human environment. Because
there will be no significant environmental impacts resulting from implementation of the proposed action, an Environmental
Impact Statement is not required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State of Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Acting Director of the Information
Resources Management Service, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior
to submission of these requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following:
(1) Type of review requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency
of collection; (4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract.
OMB invites public comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Patrick J. Sherrill
at the address specified above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 During the last fifty years, the Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy has engaged in extensive nuclear energy operations that have made large contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to our national defense and knowledge of nuclear technology. In the process, substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities of spent nuclear fuel were generated. The Department must manage that spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear fuel, and a much smaller amount that will be generated over the next 40 years, until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final decisions about its ultimate disposition are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In June 1994, the Department issued the Department of Energy Programmatic Spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear Fuel Management and Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restoration and Waste Management Programs Draft Environmental Impact Statement (SNF &amp; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
INEL EIS) (DOE/EIS&hyph;0203&hyph;D) for review and comment. A Notice of Availability was issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on June 24, 1994 (59 FR 32688). The SNF &amp; INEL EIS evaluates potential environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts that may occur under several different alternatives for managing spent nuclear fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the next 40 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential monetary costs associated with implementing the spent nuclear fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management alternatives will be considered in the Department's decision-making on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives identified in the EIS. The Cost Evaluation Report will also contain other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information (for example, estimated costs of disposal in a geologic repository) which will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful in the Department's efforts to establish baseline estimates for life-cycle program costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such information is relevant to the Department's environmental restoration and waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management responsibilities and is being consolidated into the Baseline Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Report to be issued later this year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Cost Evaluation Report
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is seeking public input on the Assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Methodology Document, which is to be used in preparing the Cost Evaluation Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cost Evaluation Report will be made available to the public before the EIS Record of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decision is issued in June 1995. Portions of this evaluation are among the many factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be considered by the Department when preparing the EIS Record of Decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Cost Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Assumptions and Methodology Document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presents the approach to be used in developing the cost evaluation, which has two primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes: to compare the monetary costs of the alternatives discussed in the SNF and INEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EIS and to explore estimated life-cycle costs to be used as relevant information to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's environmental restoration and waste management responsibilities. The Cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation Report will address a reasonable range of potential spent nuclear fuel management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project expenses, which (depending upon the alternative) include potential costs for research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and development, plant and equipment, operations and maintenance, capital/construction, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning and decontamination, and potential costs associated with disposal. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent nuclear fuel management decisions may not be made for several years. Future selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of technologies or decisions on how to prepare some fuels for storage or disposition, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, may significantly affect cost. Therefore, only relative predictions of these costs can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made at this time.

Assumptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The assumptions used in the Assumptions and Methodology Document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover three tiers: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Tier 1: Programmatic assumptions reflecting current Department policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2: Implementation of site-specific assumptions reflecting a site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 3: Technical assumptions based on expert knowledge and local conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assumptions will be based on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;When, where, and how spent nuclear fuel will be managed and dispositioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Technologies and requirements for stabilization (including processing), storage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport, and licensing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The time frame required for various factors in managing spent nuclear fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Facility lifespan, upgrades, new building, decontamination and decommissioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Methodology: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Assumptions and Methodology Document is intended to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodology for a relative comparison of costs that could be involved in Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy spent nuclear fuel management. The DOE sites already engaged in spent nuclear fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management activities will be evaluated to determine the feasibility of utilizing existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and the costs of operating and maintaining those facilities. Certain functions or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are not available at all sites under all management strategies and alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generic facility descriptions and associated costs will be developed to fill the gap between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing and needed facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To define the possible spread of costs for each alternative. To the extent practicable, estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be based upon historic data; analyses of similar activities and projecting cost to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates for new actions; use of estimates developed in other programs that address some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect of spent nuclear fuel management; and expert opinion.

a provision of Rate Schedule FT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

National requests a waiver of Section 3.2 of National's FT Rate Schedule to the extent necessary to permit National

Zone up to the lesser of customer's MDQ or the sum of customer's maximum daily contractual entitlements on the 24-inch
line, the 30-inch line, the Texas Gas Transmission Corporation loop, and the Trunkline Gas Company loop applicable
to the upstream Market Zone in which the delivery is to be made without necessarily impacting or limiting, as is the
current situation, its capacity rights in a downstream Market Zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is October 1, 1994, a date which corresponds to the date that necessary
changes to Texas Eastern's scheduling procedures and computer information systems can be implemented to accommodate
the proposed tariff changes.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 12, 1991, under section 211(f)(4) of the Clean Air Act (Act), the Ethyl Corporation (Ethyl) requested a waiver
to permit the sale of its gasoline additive, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), an octane enhancer
commercially labeled by Ethyl as HiTEC 3000, for use in unleaded gasoline. The Administrator of EPA denied Ethyl's
application for a waiver on January 8, 1992, based primarily on concerns regarding the potential for increases in
hydrocarbon emissions resulting from MMT use. Ethyl subsequently sought judicial review of that decision in the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Based on new emissions data developed and submitted to
EPA by Ethyl, EPA requested that the Court of Appeals remand Ethyl's application to the Agency for further action.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 30, 1993, the Administrator of EPA found that Ethyl had met its burden to demonstrate under section 211(f)(4)
that approval of its remanded application would not cause or contribute to a failure to meet emission standards. Ethyl
agreed to resubmit its application at that time, thereby affording further time for the Agency to consider the issue
of potential health effects associated with use of MMT in unleaded gasoline. Ethyl and EPA later agreed to further
extend the deadline for final action on Ethyl's application to July 13, 1994. The Agency is today denying Ethyl's request
for a waiver for HiTEC 3000 based on unresolved concerns regarding the potential impact of manganese emissions resulting
from MMT use on public health.

Section 211(f)(1)(A) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective March 31, 1977, for any manufacturer of a fuel or fuel
additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for
use in light-duty motor vehicles manufactured after model year 1974 which is not substantially similar to any fuel
or fuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or subsequent model year, vehicle or engine
under section 206 of the Act. An interpretive rule defining the term ``substantially similar'' under section 211(f)(1)(A)
was promulgated for unleaded gasoline at 46 FR 38582 (July 28, 1981), and revised at 56 FR 5352 (February 11, 1991).
Section 211(f)(1)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful, effective November 15, 1990, for any manufacturer of a fuel or fuel
additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for
use by any person in motor vehicles manufactured after model-year 1974 which is not substantially similar to any fuel
or fuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or subsequent model year, vehicle or engine
under section 206 of the Act. Thus, section 211(f)(1)(B) expands the prohibitions of 211(f)(1)(A), which apply only
to light-duty vehicles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(f)(4) of the Act provides that upon application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by any fuel or fuel additive manufacturer, the Administrator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA may waive the prohibitions of section 211(f)(1) if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator determines that the applicant has established that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contribute to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emissions standards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it has been certified pursuant to section 206 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator does not act to grant or deny a waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 180 days of receipt of the application, the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the waiver shall be treated as granted. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject of this notice is an application by Ethyl under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(f)(4) of the Act for a waiver for the fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), commercially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled by Ethyl as HiTEC 3000, to be blended in unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline resulting in a level of 0.03125 (1/32) gram per gallon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese (gpg Mn). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Agency action is a reconsideration of Ethyl's fourth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for a waiver for MMT. Ethyl's first application was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted on March 17, 1978 for concentrations of MMT resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1/16 and 1/32 gpg Mn in unleaded gasoline. Ethyl's second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application was submitted on May 26, 1981 for concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT resulting in 1/64 gpg Mn in unleaded gasoline. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator denied these requests for waivers due to concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding increases in exhaust hydrocarbon emissions resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from MMT use. The decisions and justifications thereof may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the September 18, 1978

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 46 FR 58630. Ethyl's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
third application was submitted on May 9, 1990, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of MMT resulting in a level of 0.3125 (1/32) gpg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn in unleaded gasoline (the same levels which are requested in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application which is the subject of today's notice). Ethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrew its third application on November 1, 1990, before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadline for the Administrator to make a determination on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. Because no determination had been made at the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl withdrew that application, EPA accepted the withdrawal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately terminated the proceeding without action on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's fourth application was submitted on July 12, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This application was, from a practical standpoint, an extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the third application, the entire record of which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by Ethyl into the current proceeding. On January 8, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, the Administrator of EPA denied Ethyl's fourth application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a waiver (57 FR 2535, January 22, 1992). The application was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denied based in part upon data submitted by Ford Motor Company 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ford) which indicated that, for the model groups tested by Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, for the conditions under which Ford tested its vehicles, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases in hydrocarbon exhaust emissions as a result of the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MMT were substantially greater than those observed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl test program. The Agency stated in its decision that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely factor which might account for the differences observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the Ethyl and Ford test programs was the severity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driving cycle. However, the Agency also concluded that other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors might be responsible for the observed differences. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the denial decision, the Agency stated that it had always 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted data from test programs which ``model'' the fleet in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of waiver applications, but that if an interested party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were to present data indicating that a potentially significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subset of the fleet, not tested by the applicant, was especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible to the negative effects of the additive, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could reasonably require specific testing on representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
models of that sub-fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its decision, the Agency also stated that it believes it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reasonable to consider the effect of a fuel on vehicles' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to meet future emissions standards. (The ``Tier I'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tailpipe standards prescribed by section 202(g) of the Act began 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to take effect in model year 1994, which began approximately in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1993.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
) Therefore, regarding the Ford data mentioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the Agency stated in its decision that the concerns raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by that data related to both current and future standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although not the basis of the 1992 denial, another important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue arose during the consideration of Ethyl's third and fourth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications. The Agency, as well as several commentors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed concerns regarding the possible adverse health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an increase in airborne manganese resulting from MMT use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These concerns were centered around: (1) The known severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic effects of high-level exposure to manganese through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhalation, (2) the lack of data regarding the chronic effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of low-level inhalation exposure to manganese in humans, and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lack of knowledge regarding potential exposures due to MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. It was repeatedly pointed out by commenters that neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage could occur prior to the onset of overt symptoms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In those proceedings, Ethyl also submitted comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding manganese emissions. Ethyl indicated that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese emissions resulting from the use of MMT in unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline would be so small as to not materially affect human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to airborne manganese. In support of its view, Ethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted analyses and data on exposure modeling and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in both its 1990 and 1991 applications (and in subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submissions associated with the remand discussed below). (The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue of manganese emissions and public health is discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more detail in Section VI of this document.)

During EPA's consideration of the 1990 Ethyl submission, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) conducted a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese inhalation risk assessment based on the available data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which found that because of ``the considerable uncertainties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data gaps in the available information *&blank;*&blank;* it is not possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* to conclude definitively that the increased use of MMT as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel additive will (or will not) increase public health risk.''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EPA also investigated potential hazards associated with water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination resulting from accidental spills or leakages of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pure MMT and concluded that spills or leaks, if they occurred, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are likely to be contained and therefore would not pose a human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risk due to groundwater contamination. However, data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to EPA are insufficient to determine whether spills and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks could affect exposure to benthic organisms.)

Additionally, in order to obtain assistance in describing

information needed to improve its manganese health risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment (and also to improve its environmental hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of issues associated with MMT itself), EPA, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conjunction with the National Institute of Environmental Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sciences, conducted a Manganese/MMT Symposium and Workshop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
March 12&hyph;15, 1991. The conference allowed the Agency to solicit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific information from invited extramural scientists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflecting a wide range of scientific disciplines. Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants included representatives of Ethyl Corporation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Defense Fund, the Centers for Disease Control, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environment Canada. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary of the workshop discussions was provided to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participant and the information obtained from this meeting was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also used by EPA to prepare a report on prioritized research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for improving its manganese inhalation risk assessment.

EPA raised the issue of potential health effects associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with manganese exposure as a concern in its January 1992 denial, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but did not base its decision on this concern because the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the uncertainties regarding hydrocarbon emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases prevented EPA from making the requisite ``cause or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute'' determination concerning effects on regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 13, 1992, Ethyl filed a petition for review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the January 8, 1992 waiver denial decision in the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl subsequently entered discussions concerning a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement of the court case. In the context of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussions, Ethyl submitted to the Agency new emissions test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data developed by Ethyl since the denial decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data, EPA tentatively concluded that the data indicated that
driving cycle did not contribute significantly to MMT-induced increases in HC emissions. (EPA's preliminary analysis
was placed in docket A&hyph;92&hyph;41.) However, in addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl
data appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than
that observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's new program or in the original Ethyl test program). The Agency
remained concerned that these data might indicate that certain engine and emissions control system configurations
are more vulnerable to a MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate further settlement discussions with Ethyl, EPA decided to attempt to formulate an emission testing
program intended to address in a timely manner specific unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions:
(1) whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions
similar to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels containing MMT have significant adverse effects
on emissions from vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to meet future standards. On October
28, 1992, EPA held a public workshop to assist the Agency in its attempt to formulate such an emission testing program
(57 FR 44740, September 29, 1992). In particular, EPA hoped to obtain information and assistance from technical experts
outside of the Agency concerning the test program and, in view of the significance of any future waiver decision concerning
MMT for the auto industry and the general public, EPA was interested in obtaining comments concerning a decisional
framework designed to address and resolve these issues. A proposed emission test program developed by the Agency
and presented at the public workshop, was effectively adopted by Ethyl as its most recent vehicle emissions test program
involving the 1993 model fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although further settlement discussions between Ethyl and EPA were held subsequent to the public workshop, the parties
were not successful in reaching a settlement. However, despite the failure of the parties to reach agreement, EPA
concluded that the Administrator's denial decision should be reconsidered in light of the new emissions data generated
by Ethyl subsequent to the decision. Accordingly, EPA requested that the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia remand the denial decision to EPA for reconsideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1993, the Court of Appeals issued a decision granting the Agency's motion and remanding the case to the Agency
to redetermine within 180 days whether to grant or deny Ethyl's application. The mandate implementing this judgement
was transmitted to the Agency on June 3, 1993. Pursuant to the court's remand decision, the Agency published a notice
indicating the commencement of a comment period (58 FR 35950, July 2, 1993). The Administrator's final decision on
remand was due within 180 days after the transmittal of the court's mandate, or by November 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the Court of Appeals granted the Agency's motion to remand the denial decision concerning Ethyl's July 12, 1991
application, Ethyl submitted to EPA a substantial amount of additional data on emission testing with fuels containing
MMT. (Specific aspects of these data are discussed below in Section IV of this document). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the course of the remand of Ethyl's waiver application, the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) reviewed
the available data concerning the health effects associated with inhalation of manganese as part of a process to revise
the reference concentration (RfC) for inhaled manganese.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 An inhalation reference concentration is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning perhaps an order of magnitude)
of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be
without appreciable risk of deleterious non-cancer health effects during a lifetime. The methodology for establishing
an RfC accounts for uncertainties and gaps in the health data base through the assignment of uncertainty factors.
In November, 1993, ORD completed preparation and review of, and EPA released to Ethyl, a document identifying and
describing the rationale for a new inhalation RfC of 0.05 ug/m3 for manganese and manganese compounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, an inhalation reference concentration (RfC) for manganese of 0.4 ug/m3 was verified and placed on IRIS. The
original RfC for manganese figured into a 1990 risk assessment of MMT prepared by the EPA Office of Research and Development
(ORD). Subsequently, in light of new information submitted by Ethyl and new results from more recently published
studies concerning manganese inhalation health effects in workers, EPA reexamined the RfC for manganese and revised
it to a value of 0.05 ug/m3 in 1993. This revised RfC for manganese was made available to Ethyl and placed on IRIS in November
1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ethyl subsequently provided to EPA a detailed critique of the approach utilized to derive the revised manganese RfC.
Among other things, Ethyl argued that EPA used an inappropriate procedure to derive the RfC from a study of occupational
manganese exposures by Roels, et al. (1992). Ethyl also argued that use of MMT would not result in significant changes
in background manganese exposures, and that the favorable effects on public health resulting from changes in the
composition of gasoline when MMT is utilized would outweigh any potential for adverse health effects. (Copies of
documents describing the revised RfC and of the Ethyl comments are available in the public docket.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the deadline of November 30, 1993, for final action by EPA on Ethyl's waiver application approached, EPA concluded
that the extensive data base on the emission effects of MMT assembled by Ethyl and others during the consideration
of the application was sufficient to permit a decision concerning whether Ethyl had satisfied the statutory requirement
to show that use of MMT will not cause or contribute to exceedence of emission standards. However, there had been insufficient
opportunity for public comment concerning the use of a revised manganese inhalation RfC in assessing any risks that
might be posed by granting Ethyl's application. Ethyl argued that it had not been afforded an adequate opportunity
to study the derivation of the RfC and to comment on its implications for Ethyl's application. While EPA scientists
did not necessarily agree with the specific technical arguments concerning the revised RfC and other issues pertaining
to health effects made by Ethyl, EPA concluded that it might be useful to review the revised RfC in light of further analyses
of the available data as well as the underlying data from occupational studies of inhaled manganese if such data could
be readily obtained. EPA also concluded that it would be desirable in any case to have further dialogue with Ethyl and
other interested parties on issues related to the health effects of manganese before EPA was to make a final decision
concerning Ethyl's waiver application.

As a result of these factors, Ethyl and EPA entered into discussions concerning a possible extension of the deadline
for a decision. Ultimately, an agreement between Ethyl and EPA concerning such an extension was implemented on November
30, 1993, and notice of the agreement was published in the

<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 EPA was thus required to take final action either granting or denying Ethyl's resubmitted application by May 29, 1994.
For purposes of the resubmitted application, the EPA Administrator determined that Ethyl had demonstrated, as required
by section 211(f)(4), that use of HiTEC 3000 at the specified concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure
of any emission control device or system (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such device or system is used)
to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified.

 The Agency stated clearly in the December 9, 1993

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that this determination would not preclude any subsequent regulatory action based on emission effects under
Clean Air Act section 211(c) or any other provision of the Clean Air Act in the event that the resubmitted Ethyl waiver
application were to be granted in the future. The Agency also made it clear that this determination would not apply
in the context of any other new waiver application concerning HiTEC 3000 or MMT which might be submitted in the future
if EPA were to deny Ethyl's resubmitted waiver application on other grounds. Further review of Ethyl's application
during this 180 day period focused in particular on the issues relating to the potential health effects on public health
if EPA were to permit use of MMT as a fuel additive.

As is explained in section IV of this document, this decision was based primarily upon application of the previously
used statistical tests to the submitted emissions data. As is also explained in section IV, the Agency believes that
these tests may be outdated and is considering a formal change in its method of analysis of such data.

Ethyl and EPA both desired and intended to assure continuity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the proceedings concerning the July 12, 1991 waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, as remanded to EPA by the Court of Appeals, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's resubmitted waiver application. The entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative record compiled by EPA in support of the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denial decision, as well as all submissions to the public docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the remanded application, was incorporated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record this final decision on the resubmitted application. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
docket number for the resubmitted waiver application also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remained the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional 180 days that were provided by Ethyl's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement to resubmit the waiver application were utilized by EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to evaluate remaining issues that may have been relevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
today's decision. In particular, EPA continued to examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects on public health that might be associated with approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Ethyl's application. EPA considered any additional underlying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data concerning studies of occupational manganese exposure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were obtained by or submitted to EPA, as well as any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data or information pertaining to the health effects of manganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by Ethyl or other interested persons during the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. Any additional information that was submitted was also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in exploring alternative candidate RfC estimates and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their relationship to the verified revised RfC. EPA also used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the additional time provided by the extension to make a decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on how the RfC should be utilized in assessing health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may be associated with MMT use, evaluate potential exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to manganese compounds associated with MMT use, complete a risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment concerning Ethyl's application, and decide what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional data, if any, should be provided by Ethyl either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before or after MMT is introduced into the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 28, 1994, EPA provided Ethyl Corporation with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft of the revised risk assessment, which updated the 1991 ORD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment and incorporated further analyses performed during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
180-day extension period. Subsequent to providing Ethyl with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this draft, Ethyl provided EPA with comments on the draft and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some additional new data on ambient manganese concentrations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several Canadian cities. In order to allow the Agency time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider this new data, Ethyl requested, and the Agency agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to, an extension of the decision deadline until July 13, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An agreement implementing this extension was executed by EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl counsel on May 24, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. History of Statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress first added section 211(f) to the Clean Air Act in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1977 based primarily on concerns that fuels or additives might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage vehicle emission control devices. Thus, the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute focused on vehicles designed to use unleaded gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibiting the general use in fuels of materials not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substantially similar'' to fuels used to certify vehicles to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions standards. Section 211(f) also provided that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator of EPA ``may waive the prohibitions *&blank;*&blank;* if he 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that the applicant has established that such fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel additive *&blank;*&blank;* will not cause or contribute to a failure of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control device or system *&blank;*&blank;* to achieve compliance by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle with the emission standards with respect to which it has been certified pursuant to section 206.''
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute provides that if the Administrator does not act to grant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or deny the waiver request within 180 days of receipt of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, the waiver request shall be treated as granted.

Section 206 of the Act sets forth the certification requirements with which vehicle manufacturers must comply in
order to introduce into commerce new model year motor vehicles. Under &sect;202 of the Act, standards for hydrocarbon
(HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions for gasoline, gaseous fuel, diesel and methanol-powered
motor vehicles have been established. For gasoline, gaseous fuel and diesel-powered motor vehicles, standards
have also been established for particulate emissions.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 211(f) was initially interpreted by the Agency as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying only to unleaded gasoline. In the 1990 Amendments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(f)(1) was broadly expanded to cover all other fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fuel additives, including leaded gasoline, diesel fuel, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer additives.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The 1990 Amendments also apply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of this subsection to vehicles other than lightduty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles. Section 211(f)(1)(B) of the Act makes it unlawful, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective November 15, 1990, for any manufacturer of a fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel additive to first introduce into commerce, or to increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concentration in use of, any fuel or fuel additive for use by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any person in motor vehicles manufactured after model year 1974 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is not substantially similar to any fuel or fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent model year, vehicle or engine under section 206 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Thus, section 211(f)(1)(B) expands to all motor vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel prohibitions of the original section 211(f)(1) (now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignated as section 211(f)(1)(A)), which apply only to light-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duty vehicles.

An interpretive rule defining the term ``substantially similar'' under section 211(f)(1)(A) was promulgated for
unleaded gasoline at 46 FR 38582 (July 28, 1981), and revised at 56 FR 5352 (February 11, 1991). An advance notice of
proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) has been published to begin the proces of promulgating an interpretive rule to define
the term ``substantially similar'' under &sect;211(f)(1)(B) for diesel fuel and diesel fuel additives. See 56 FR
24362 (May 30, 1991).

In adding section 211, the first focus of Congress was to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the introduction of new additives which may prove harmful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to emission control devices but to allow for the introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such additives if it could be demonstrated that they would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harm emission control devices. Furthermore, in framing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute such that the Administrator was not required to grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver, Congress provided authority to the Administrator to take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into account other considerations associated with introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new material into commerce.

for this waiver decision.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The Agency interprets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(f)(4) of the Act as establishing a two stage process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the decision to grant or deny a waiver application. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first stage of the process focuses solely on whether a waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant has met its burden to demonstrate that a fuel does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause or contribute to a failure to meet emission standards. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second stage of the process reflects the discretionary authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to the Agency by the statute.

Section 211(f)(4) states that ``The Administrator, upon application of any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive,
may waive the prohibitions established under paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection, or the limitation specified
in paragraph (2) of this subsection, if he determines that the applicant has established that such fuel or fuel additive
or a specified concentration thereof, and the emission products of such fuel or additive or specified concentration
thereof, will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful life of
any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards
with respect to which it has been certified pursuant to section 206. If the Administrator has not acted to grant or deny
an application under this paragraph within one hundred and eighty days of receipt of such application, the waiver
authorized by this paragraph shall be treated as granted.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the first stage of the waiver process, the sole issue is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a fuel ``causes or contributes'' to an emission standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure. The waiver applicant bears the burden of demonstrating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a fuel will neither cause nor contribute to an emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard failure for any regulated pollutant. Balancing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission effects of a fuel for one pollutant against those for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other pollutant(s) is not permissible under the statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language. For example, an applicant would not meet its burden of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proof if its testing of a fuel shows that it causes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributes to an emission standard failure for CO, even though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing shows decreases in emissions of HC and NOx. If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant does not meet its burden of demonstrating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``cause or contribute'' test is met, the Agency cannot grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver. If an applicant does meet its burden, the Agency may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then exercise its discretion to grant or to deny a waiver in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second stage of the process.

Under the statute, if the Agency does not take action to grant or deny a waiver application within 180 days of submittal,
the waiver is deemed granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute provides that the Agency ``may'' grant a waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application if the ``cause or contribute'' test is met, but does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not require such an action. The Agency may therefore choose not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to grant a waiver based on other issues (e.g., public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects) that indicate that it would not be in the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest to do so. In this second stage of the process, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency has a great deal of discretion to determine which issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be examined and to balance the potential positive and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative impacts of a waiver. Such discretionary authority is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounded not only in Congress' use of the term ``may'' rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``shall'' in section 211(f)(4), but also in the goals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of section 211 when read as a whole. The Agency does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not believe that Congress intended to require EPA to grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver under section 211(f)(4) when available information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the fuel would be potentially subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory control under section 211(c)(1) immediately upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of the waiver. Similarly, EPA believes that Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not intend to preclude a determination of whether issuance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a waiver is consistent with other important goals of the Act once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has been demonstrated that the mandatory ``cause or contribute'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test has been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This does not mean that the Administrator has unfettered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to deny a waiver application for any reason. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds for any denial must not be arbitrary or capricious or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute an abuse of discretion. Thus, in using discretion to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny an application, the Administrator must identify and explain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the factors on which a discretionary denial decision is based and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must assure that the policy adopted is consistent for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similarly situated waiver applicants.

C. Consideration of Potential Health Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the basis for a discretionary denial must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rational and non-arbitrary, nothing in the statute limits the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of factors which the Administrator may consider in deciding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to deny an application. Section 101(b)(1) states that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the purposes of the Act is to ``protect and enhance the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the Nation's air resources so as to promote the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and welfare and the productive capacity of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population.'' Given this general goal of the Act, certainly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential effects on public health of vehicle emissions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a factor which the Administrator may reasonably consider when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing the discretion which section 211(f)(4) authorizes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator must require the manufacturer of a fuel or additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to produce data concerning potential health effects as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of, or a prerequisite to, registration of the fuel or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Under section 211(c)(1), the Administrator may, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on data collected under sections 211(b) and 211(e) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise available, issue regulations controlling manufacture or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sale of any fuel or fuel additive which the Administrator finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
welfare.'' These provisions indicate that Congress intended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator be concerned about the potential health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fuels and fuel additives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 211(a) and 211(b)(1) require the registration of fuels and additives designated by the Administrator as
a precondition to introduction into commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The fact that the Administrator may control fuels or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives which pose potential health effects under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(c)(1) does not mean that the Administrator may not consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects as a factor in deciding whether to grant a waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 211(f)(4). Such a construction of the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would lead to absurd results, precluding the Administrator from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
denying a waiver application and leading to potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction of a fuel or additive into commerce, even in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific circumstances where the Administrator has concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are grounds for issuance of a proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibiting the fuel or additive under section 211(c). However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although this reasoning indicates that Congress could not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably intended to completely preclude the consideration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects under section 211(f)(4), this does not mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(c) limits the circumstances in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may consider potential health effects as part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver decision. Clearly, it was the intention of Congress to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treat fuels and fuel additives already registered and being sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 211(f)(4) of the Act, twenty-three applications for waivers of the section 211(f)(1) prohibitions
have been received. Of these, twenty-two applications have sought a waiver for additives for unleaded gasoline.
One, the most recent, sought a waiver of the section 211(f)(1)(B) prohibitions for an additive to diesel fuel.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Of these twenty-three applications, ten applications have been granted (some with conditions attached), ten have
been denied, and three were withdrawn by the applicant prior to the Agency's decision.

Section 211(f)(4) clearly places upon the waiver applicant the burden of establishing that its fuel will not cause
or contribute to the failure of any vehicle to meet emission standards. Absent a sufficient showing, the Administrator
cannot make the required determination and cannot grant the waiver. If interpreted literally, however, this burden
of proof imposed by the Act would be virtually impossible for an applicant to meet, as it requires the proof of a negative
proposition: that no vehicle will fail to meet emission standards to which it has been certified. Such a literal interpretation
could be construed as requiring the testing of every vehicle. Recognizing that Congress contemplated a workable
waiver provision, EPA has previously indicated that reliable statistical sampling and fleet testing protocols
may be used to demonstrate that a fuel under consideration would not cause or contribute to a significant failure to
meet emission standards by vehicles in the national fleet.

To determine whether a waiver applicant has established that the proposed fuel will not cause or contribute to vehicles
failing emission standards, EPA reviews all the material in the public docket, including the data submitted with
the application and public comments on the application, and analyzes the data to ascertain the fuel's emission effects.
The analysis concentrates on four major areas of concern_exhaust emissions, evaporative emissions, materials'
compatibility, and driveability_and evaluates the data under statistical methods appropriate to the various types
of emission effects. Emission data are analyzed according to the effects that a fuel is predicted to have on emissions
over time. If the fuel is predicted to have only an instantaneous effect on emissions (that is, the emission effects
of the fuel are immediate and remain constant throughout the life of the vehicle when operating on the waiver fuel),
then ``back-to-back'' emissions testing will suffice.

Back-to-back emission testing involves testing a vehicle on a base fuel (i.e., a gasoline which meets specifications
for certification fuel or is representative of a typically available commercial gasoline), then testing that same
vehicle on the fuel for which the waiver is requested. The difference in emission levels is attributed to the waiver
fuel.

Unlike materials traditionally allowed in unleaded gasoline, metallics, such as MMT, produce non-gaseous combustion
products, some of which may be deposited in the parts of the vehicle that come in contact with the combustion products
of the burned fuel. These areas of the vehicle include the combustion chamber, the catalyst, the oxygen sensor, and
all parts of the exhaust system.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Since these materials build up over time,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 it has been traditionally accepted that the emissions effects of such additives occur over time as miles are accumulated,
and that the method of deposition suggests that the effects are permanent. If the fuel is predicted to have such a long-term
deteriorative effect, durability testing over the useful life of the vehicle,
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 in addition to back-to-back testing, is appropriate.

Automakers and catalyst manufacturers point out that, since catalysts are designed with a honeycomb structure in
order to maximize contact between engine combustion gases and catalyst materials, if channels within the honeycomb
become blocked, the catalyst is less able to break down the exhaust gases. Furthermore, although the mechanisms associated
with manganese deposits have not been completely described, catalyst manufacturers suggest that the mere disposition
of manganese (without blockage of channels) would hinder the catalytic activity of the catalyst. Ethyl, however,
believes that the manganese deposition on the catalyst does not hinder its activity.

The ``useful life'' of a 1993 or earlier model year light-duty vehicle (LDV) (i.e., the amount of time or mileage accumulation
through which the LDV must meet the standards to which it has been certified) is 50,000 miles or five years, whichever
occurs first (&sect;202(d)). The 1990 Amendments extended the useful life of LDVs to 100,000 miles or ten years, beginning
with 1994 model year vehicles. The amendments also tightened emissions standards for 40 percent of a vehicle manufacturer's
LDV and light-duty truck (LDT) sales in model year 1994, 80 percent in model year 1995 and for all vehicles after model
year 1995 (&sect;202(g)). The useful life for heavy-duty vehicles and engines is generally 120,000 miles or eleven
years.

Durability testing over the useful life of the vehicle has involved testing two identical sets of vehicles for 50,000
miles (in the case of pre-1994 standards for LDVs), one set using the base fuel and the other using the waiver fuel. Each
vehicle is tested for emissions at 5,000 mile intervals. This is essentially the same testing pattern which has been
required for certification of a new motor vehicle under &sect;206 of the Act. As noted above, under the 1990 Amendments,
the useful life of LDVs has been extended to 100,000 miles beginning with the 1994 model year when more stringent emissions
standards took effect (

In addition to emissions data, EPA also reviews data on fuel composition and specifications, both to fully characterize
a proposed fuel, and to determine whether that fuel would cause or contribute to a failure of vehicles to comply with
their emission standards. Such a failure often can be predicted from characterization data. For example, volatility
specifications of the fuel could demonstrate a tendency for high evaporative emissions. Similarly, data on materials
compatibility could show potential failure of fuel systems, emission related parts, and/or emission control parts
from use of the fuel. Such failures could result in greater emissions. Likewise, fuel characteristics that could
cause significant driveability problems could result in tampering with emission controls and, thus, increased
emissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One issue raised previously in the context of Ethyl's present application was whether Ethyl was required to show that
MMT will not cause or contribute to noncompliance with emission standards by vehicles certified to ``future'' emission
standards (i.e., 1994 model year standards, which were not in effect at the time of the waiver application), as well
as vehicles certified to ``current'' standards (i.e., standards in effect at the time of the waiver application).
Ethyl believes that the statute only requires it to establish that MMT will not cause or contribute to the failure of
vehicles to meet current emission standards. For the reasons outlined in the Agency's January 1992 waiver decision,
EPA disagrees with this reading of the statute and continues to believe that it is appropriate to consider the effects
of an additive on vehicles' ability to meet more stringent future standards under circumstances similar to these.

In the past, EPA has analyzed both instantaneous emission effects and durability effects using statistical tests
to determine if the fuel additive will cause a ``significant'' number of vehicles to fail emissions tests.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Generally speaking, these tests have focused on the portion of the fleet that will actually fail emission standards
as a result of using the fuel or additive.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the tests used to date by the Agency primarily consider only the ``cause'' language in the statute and do not consider
the portion of the statute which requires that the applicant must also show that the fuel or additive will not ``contribute''
to the non-compliance of vehicles with emission standards.

The Agency believes that its present statistical tests and criteria do not give adequate weight to the requirement
in Section 211(f)(4) that an applicant demonstrate that a fuel will not ``contribute'' to an emission standard failure.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 This is of particular significance in light of the Clean Air Amendments of 1990, which evidence a strong Congressional
concern that more needs to be done to ensure that people are not exposed to unhealthy levels of airborne pollution.
EPA is presently reviewing alternative criteria and statistical methodologies for determining whether use of a
fuel or fuel additive will ``cause or contribute'' to emission exceedances. The Agency expects to initiate a rulemaking
in the near future which will propose more appropriate criteria and statistical methodologies for reviewing waiver
applications and will afford formal notice to future applicants of the Agency's intention to adopt revised criteria
and methodologies.

In fact, the Agency raised questions about the appropriateness of these previously used approaches in its original
decision on Ethyl's 1991 MMT waiver application.

See

As explained below, the Agency has concluded that it would not be appropriate to utilize new criteria and statistical
tests concerning which Ethyl received no prior notice in evaluating Ethyl's application. However, in the event that
Ethyl reapplies in the future for a section 211(f)(4) waiver to allow the use of MMT or any other additive, that application
will be evaluated in accordance with any new fuel waiver criteria in effect at that time.

B. Discretionary Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in part II of this decision, above, the Agency believes that the use of the term ``may'' in Section 211(f)(4)
of the Act affords the Administrator broad discretion to consider other factors in deciding whether to grant a waiver,
once a waiver applicant has demonstrated that a fuel or fuel additive will not cause or contribute to an emission standard
failure. This construction of section 211(f)(4) is also consistent with the other provisions of and the general purposes
underlying the Clean Air Act. Although the Administrator has not relied on this discretionary authority to deny a
waiver in the past, certain general principles should guide the Administrator's exercise of such authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the discretion of the Administrator to consider other factors in making a waiver decision is broad, it is
not unfettered. To assure that any decision based on factors other than emission standard failures is not arbitrary
and is based on a proper record, the applicant and other interested persons should be afforded proper notice of any
additional factors to be considered by the Administrator and an opportunity to comment or submit information concerning
those factors. Any decision based on the discretionary authority of the Administrator to consider other factors
should include an explanation of the factors which were considered and the relation of those factors to the decision.
Moreover, any policy adopted as part of a decision to deny a waiver on a discretionary basis should be applied consistently
to all similarly situated applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection of the public health is a major goal of both the Clean Air Act in general and the section 211 fuels provisions
in particular. Accordingly, the Agency believes that when a waiver is sought for a fuel or fuel additive and there are
unresolved concerns regarding the potential impact of that fuel or fuel additive on public health, potential health
effects can and should be examined as part of the waiver process. As part of this examination of the potential health
effects of a fuel or additive, the Agency should review any relevant studies or analyses of which it is aware or which
are brought to its attention by the waiver applicant or by commenters on the waiver application.

In addition to potential health effects, the Agency may

consider other factors as appropriate in deciding whether it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be in the public interest to grant a waiver. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, the Agency may consider whether a waiver would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instance, the factors considered and relied upon should be

A. Description of Previous Test Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In support of its request, Ethyl conducted an extensive test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program to determine the effect of MMT on the ability of vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comply with current and future emission standards. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered the impact of MMT on nonregulated vehicle emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urban smog or ozone, refinery emissions, and crude oil use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl claimed that its test results established that MMT would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not cause or contribute to exceedences of current or future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standards. It also claimed that MMT use would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other benefits consistent with Clean Air Act goals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1988, Ethyl assembled a test fleet of 48 light-duty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles, composed of eight different model types (six Buick 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Centurys (2.5 liter), six Buick Centurys (2.8 liter), six Buick 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Centurys (3.8 liter), six Chevrolet Cavaliers (2.0 liter), six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford Escorts (1.9 liter), six Ford Tauruses (3.0 liter), six Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crown Victorias (5.0 liter) and six Dodge Dynastys (3.0 liter)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that together represented a broad spectrum of then current (1988) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology vehicles. To accumulate mileage, Ethyl utilized the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Alternative Mileage Accumulation Cycle'' (AMA) which is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard procedure utilized to accumulate mileage for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification purposes.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 It utilized two laboratories to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure each vehicle's exhaust emissions of the regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollutants (HC, oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and carbon monoxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CO)) at 5,000-mile intervals up to 75,000 miles in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most vehicles and up to 100,000 miles in the case of several.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also tested a number of these vehicles for evaporative HC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate and manganese emissions, materials compatibility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driveability and catalyst durability.

A driving cycle is a description of how to drive a vehicle to accumulate mileage, including such things as a what percentage
of driving should be done at what speed and what the overall average speed should be. The AMA cycle is described in EPA
Mobile Source Advisory Circular 37&hyph;A, (See Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;46) and is essentially prescribed for use
by manufacturers to accumulate mileage for certification of vehicles (See 40 CFR 86.092&hyph;26). A driving cycle
is used so that test vehicles accumulate mileage in a manner that is supposedly representative of in-use vehicles.
The emissions of a test vehicle that has accumulated mileage according to a driving cycle representative of in-use
vehicles are more likely to be representative of in-use vehicles' emissions. There are actually three alternative
cycles associated with the AMA; however, the average speeds of the three alternatives are very similar, ranging from
29.9 mph to 30.72 mph.

The ``useful life'' of model year 1993 and earlier light-duty vehicles (LDV's) is 50,000 miles or five years, whichever
occurs first (section 202(d)). However, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 extended the useful life of LDV's to 100,000
miles or ten years, beginning with 1994 model year vehicles. For the standards that begin to take effect in model year
1994, section 207(c) provides for intermediate in-use standards for several years.

Ethyl analyzed the data collected using EPA's previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used statistical tests (43 FR 41424, September 18, 1978) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional tests developed by its consultants to further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize the data. Its analysis indicated that, on average, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT at the requested concentration would result in a 0.018 gpm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in HC emissions and decreases in NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analyses further indicated that, when EPA's previously used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests are applied, the increase in HC emissions would not cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or contribute to vehicles' failure to meet the current HC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission standard. The results of Ethyl's testing for materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compatibility, driveability and catalyst durability also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that MMT would have no significant adverse effects on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles' ability to meet current emission standards under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average driving conditions. On that basis, Ethyl claimed that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had made its statutorily required showing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl also submitted data on the catalyst efficiency of the vehicles which it tested. Ethyl performed back-pressure
tests
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 on all its vehicle fleet except one model group after accumulation of 75,000 miles. Back-pressure tests were also
performed on a pair of Ford Crown Victorias, one operated on MMT-fuel and one on clear fuel, at speeds higher than those
used in Ethyl's 48-vehicle test program.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 The results of these tests indicated that back-pressure was not significantly different in the MMT vehicles when
compared to the clear fuel vehicles. Ethyl also operated two 5.7 liter Corvettes at extremely high speeds (100 mph)
for 25,000 miles, one using MMT fuel and one using clear fuel. Although similar in magnitude, the back pressure for
the MMT vehicle was slightly higher than that for the clear vehicle. Ethyl also presented catalyst efficiency
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 data based on engine-out emissions of its fleet and based on ``slave engine'' testing
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 for half of its fleet. Results of the slave engine testing indicated no statistically significant difference between
the catalyst efficiencies for the MMT vehicle components when compared with the clear vehicle components. Finally,
four Chevrolet Corsicas were operated to 100,000 miles, two utilizing MMT fuel and two with clear fuel. The purpose
of this testing was to investigate MMT's effect on the catalyst for a longer mileage interval than the 75,000 miles
over which most of Ethyl's fleet had been driven. Catalyst efficiencies of the MMT vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not significantly different when compared to the clear fuel vehicles.

Back pressure tests are used to determine if significant plugging has occurred in a vehicle's catalyst. The total
pressure ahead of the catalyst is back pressure. This pressure is a measure of constriction in flow through the exhaust
system caused by flow of the exhaust through the emissions control system and the noise-reducing components of the
vehicle. If plugging has occurred in a vehicle, the total pressure ahead of its catalyst, the back pressure, should
be greater than expected (e.g., greater than a matching control vehicle).

``Slave engine'' testing is the testing of vehicle components on a single engine which is not in a vehicle. In this case,
catalyst efficiencies between control and MMT vehicles were investigated using exhaust gases from this single engine
which were routed through the removed catalysts. This would likely result in a more accurate analysis of catalyst
efficiency, since one possible confounding factor, vehicle to vehicle variability, would be eliminated.

Ford presented original test data which Ford said supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its contention that actual in-use MMT-induced HC emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases are potentially far greater than those reported by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl.
<FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>
 Ford conducted testing on a more limited scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing eight vehicles, representing two model groups, run for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
105,000 miles. Ford chose two model groups which were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of its newest technology vehicles at the time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One (the Explorer) represented a technology that Ford believed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be especially prone to exhibit a buildup of manganese, due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly higher operating temperatures and loads than those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of passenger cars. The other model group, the Escorts, had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close-coupled catalysts, a design which is being incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into many new vehicles in order to meet tighter emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Like Ethyl, Ford operated part of its test fleet on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear fuel and part on fuel containing 1/32 gpg MMT. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford's test program differed from Ethyl's program in several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways. When accumulating mileage, Ford utilized a commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline which contained all of the additives (detergents, etc.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically found in such fuels. Ethyl utilized a very high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality test fuel with tight specifications and no additives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Although used for actual emissions testing purposes, Ethyl's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel would not be allowed for mileage accumulation when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying vehicles since it is not representative of in-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel.) When accumulating mileage, Ford utilized what it called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its ``durability cycle'' which it had previously developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compared to the AMA cycle used by Ethyl, Ford's driving cycle had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a higher average speed (54 miles per hour (mph) versus 30 mph), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a higher percentage of high speed driving.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 (As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously mentioned, Ethyl utilized the AMA cycle used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification purposes.) Additionally, in the Ford program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles were tested for emissions at five mileage intervals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5,000, 20,000, 55,000, 85,000
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 and 105,000 miles) and six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions tests were done at each testing interval. Ethyl, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison, conducted testing every 5,000 miles to 75,000 miles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15 intervals) and utilized two emissions tests at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Ford's test vehicles showed an elevation of HC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions with MMT that was substantially greater than the 0.018 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gpm reported by Ethyl from its test program.

Ford indicated that drivers who accumulated mileage in its test program were asked to follow posted speed limits.
Ford indicated that the cycle consisted of 5% city driving (25 to 45 mph), 5% gravel or off road driving (25 to 45 mph),
20% rural driving (45 to 55 mph), and 70% highway driving (65 mph). Posted speed limits are shown in parentheses. By
way of comparison, the AMA cycle consists of 16.1% of driving at 30 mph, 22.6 at 35 mph, 20.9 at 40 mph, 6.4 at 45 mph, 17%
at variable speed and one of the three following options: 16.7% at 50 mph or 16.5% at 55 mph or 8.6% and 7.9% at 55 mph and

Toyota also submitted data on a single vehicle which was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated for 30,000 miles on MMT-containing fuel after which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen sensor and catalyst were replaced with new components and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then driven on fuel not containing MMT for 30,000 miles. Toyota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also used a driving cycle with an average speed (41.7 mph) higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than that used by Ethyl for mileage accumulation and used fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with what Toyota believed was a relatively high trace level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead than that usually found in unleaded gasoline (0.0045 gpg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead) and oil with a relatively high phosphorus level (0.13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight percent). Toyota referred to this test procedure as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Toyota 9-Laps'' and presented evidence which it said suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the catalyst degradation seen by vehicles using the Toyota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9-Lap test was very similar to in-use catalysts tested by Toyota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hence, Toyota suggested, these ``adjustments'' made in creating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota 9-Lap make the testing of a vehicle more consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what would happen in actual in-use driving. Toyota's data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated an HC level after the first 30,000 miles of vehicle use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(on MMT fuel) about 0.1 gpm higher than the same vehicle after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vehicle was driven for a second 30,000 mile interval with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new catalyst and oxygen sensor. Toyota also submitted data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that the efficiency at which the catalyst was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating for the MMT-exposed components was less than that for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the non-MMT exposed components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some time after EPA's January 8, 1992 denial decision, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Ethyl entered into discussions concerning a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settlement of the court case which Ethyl had filed. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of these discussions, Ethyl submitted to the Agency new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data it had developed since the denial decision. Ethyl tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six 1991 Escorts, using both the relatively high-speed driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern similar to that utilized by Ford in its testing of 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Escorts (the Ford cycle) and, also, after changing emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system components (catalyst and oxygen sensor), the driving cycle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by Ethyl in the original test program (EPA's durability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification cycle also known as the AMA). Half of the vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilized MMT-containing fuel and half were run on clear fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(fuel not containing MMT). Ethyl also performed some catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency tests on these vehicles utilizing a ``slave engine.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl also tested six 1988 Escorts which were used in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original test program driven on the AMA cycle. In the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, after replacing the catalyst and oxygen sensor, Ethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued mileage accumulation, from 75,000 to 100,000 miles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing the Ford cycle. Likewise, Ethyl tested six 1988 Buicks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from its original fleet accumulating mileage (100,000 to 115,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
miles) using the Ford cycle but without replacing any components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl also accumulated mileage on seven pairs of 1992 vehicles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(four Crown Victorias, Six Buick Regals and four Ford Mustangs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in test programs covering from 45,000 to 100,000 miles beyond 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
break-in with and without MMT, using the Ford cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its inspection and analysis of the new Ethyl data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency ultimately concluded that Ethyl's program had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated driving cycle does not contribute significantly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT-induced increases in hydrocarbon emissions. However, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to addressing the issue of driving cycle, the Ethyl data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeared to confirm the finding by Ford that 1991 Escorts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced a much higher MMT-induced HC increase than that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed in other models tested (either in Ethyl's 1992 fleet or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the original 1988 Ethyl fleet). The Agency was concerned that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these data could indicate that certain engine and emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control system configurations were more vulnerable to an MMT-induced emissions increase irrespective of driving
cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further assist the Agency in developing a test program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA held a workshop in October of 1992 and presented a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test program which could address in a timely manner specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unresolved issues concerning the effect of MMT on emissions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether other vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to experience increases in hydrocarbon emissions similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those observed in 1991 Ford Escorts; and (2) whether fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing MMT have significant adverse effects on emissions from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles utilizing the technologies most likely to be employed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet future standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimately the court case was not settled; however, the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program presented by the Agency at the workshop was largely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by Ethyl and is the basis of its most recent test program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving the 1993 fleet. These vehicles (with the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned 1992 vehicles) comprise Ethyl's most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dataset.

Four automakers (Ford Motor Company (Ford), General Motors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation (GM), Toyota Technical Center, U.S.A., Inc. (Toyota), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Chrysler Motors Corporation (Chrysler)), the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA) all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended denial of Ethyl's request and expressed several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns with regard to the addition of MMT to unleaded gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, they noted that the use of MMT will cause an increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HC emissions. Most indicated that the more stringent emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards that began taking effect in model year 1994 will make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any increase in HC emissions particularly troublesome. Further, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they stated that newer technology vehicles will likely be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with catalysts which are nearer the engine (more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``closely coupled'') and that such close coupling, they stated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in higher catalyst temperatures that may make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst more prone to the deposition of manganese. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters indicated that deposition of manganese compounds on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surface of the catalyst would impair the catalytic breakdown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of emissions from the engine, thereby decreasing catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness. Additionally, they were concerned that MMT, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the 1/32 gpg Mn concentration requested, would plug catalysts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus reduce the surface area of the catalyst available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
break down emissions from the engine, especially in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles operated under driving conditions which result in higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures such as heavy load or high speed. Under such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, it was pointed out, the vehicle may be more prone to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposition of manganese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl indicated that the assertions that it must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``conclusively'' demonstrate the absence of negative effects is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the section 211(f)(4) standard. Ethyl believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it need only demonstrate, by a preponderance of evidence, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the additive will not cause or contribute to the failure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission control devices to comply with applicable emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, and, further, it believes that it has made this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing. Ethyl also stated that the EPA test program proposed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its October 1992 workshop involving the accumulation of 65,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test miles, would be sufficient for purposes of gauging the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of MMT on emissions. Ethyl commented that it followed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this proposal in the 1992/93 test fleet, although mileage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation has continued beyond 65,000 miles for three of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight model year vehicles tested without new emission results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different from the trends established through 65,000 miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the automakers' concerns about effect of MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on newer emission technology such as close-coupled catalysts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl indicated that the use of the 1993 Transitional Low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission Vehicle (TLEV) Honda Civic in its most recent test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program was intended so as to introduce a vehicle which has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most physically possible close-coupled emission technology (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one connected directly to the exhaust manifold). Despite such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close-coupling, Ethyl indicated that the differences in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrocarbon emissions between clear and MMT-fueled 1993 TLEV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Honda Civics was minimal. Ethyl also indicated that this concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about close-coupled catalysts completely ignores that Ethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested two 1988 models and three 1993 models equipped with close- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled catalysts without showing any significant adverse effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota submitted data on catalysts and oxygen sensors from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-use customer vehicles from Canada where MMT is used as a fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive. Toyota believes that these catalysts and oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

that it is not clear from the description of the Toyota test

Chrysler submitted data on the analysis of four catalysts, which was completed by Johnson Matthey Incorporated (JMI)
at Chrysler's request, that had various degrees of manganese deposition from Canadian vehicles exposed to MMT in
the fuel. It indicated that the results of the analysis demonstrate that the washcoat of both the partially plugged
catalysts and unaffected catalysts exhibit a clear layer of ``densified'' washcoat containing large quantities
of manganese oxides. Chrysler believes that the JMI report supports its concern that manganese oxides can fill the
catalyst pores, thereby covering precious metal sites or decreasing wash coat surface area, consequently eventually
decreasing catalyst activity. Regarding the automakers' concerns about the Additive's effect on emissions system
components, such as exhaust oxygen sensors, exhaust gas recirculation valves, catalysts and oxygen sensors, Ethyl
stated that it has already provided extensive data showing that the Additive does not adversely effect any of these
emission system components.

Nineteen small refiners including the National Petroleum Refiners Association all recommended approval. They
concurred in Ethyl's assessment of the economic benefits and reduced refinery and vehicle emissions that would accrue
from the replacement of octane obtained through higher-severity refining with octane obtained from MMT. Several
emphasized that MMT would be especially helpful to small refiners since octane enhancement from MMT requires less
capital investment than other means of increasing octane. Many refiners also pointed out that refinery operations
at lower severity would result in decreased aromatic and benzene emissions from vehicles and increased yield for
each barrel of crude oil refined.

The criteria and statistical tests previously used by EPA to examine durability waiver applications were used only
once by the Agency prior to Ethyl's 1990 application for the use of MMT.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 These tests include a variety of approaches to durability data designed to determine whether the additive causes
increases in regulated pollutants and, if so, whether those increases bring about failure of vehicles in the fleet
to meet the standards to which they were certified. While EPA has some concerns regarding the appropriateness of these
criteria and tests for current conditions, the Agency does not intend in this action to hold Ethyl to any new criteria
and/or tests that are not currently in place. Accordingly, the following discussion is addressed primarily to the
results of applying the most critical of the previously used EPA tests.

Ethyl's consultant, Systems Applications, Inc., describes this test on page 19 of a report that was included as Appendix
2A in Ethyl's May 9, 1990 application for waiver. This co-called ``cause or contribute'' test, really addresses the
question of whether the additive ``causes'' a failure to meet the certified standard for a regulated pollutant for
each model group and then looks to see if enough model groups failed the test to warrant the conclusion with high confidence
that more than half of the models are caused to fail by operation on the additive.

When the larger body of all available and appropriate
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
 long-term emissions data on High-Tech 3000 is evaluated using these previously used EPA tests, the conclusion is
that these increases (averaging 0.02 gm/mi for HC) bring about failure of the ``cause or contribute'' test in only
4 (for HC) or 5 (for CO) of the 19 model groups tested by the applicant and others. Failure of that test
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 must occur in at least 13 of the 19 model groups examined before the additive is deemed to have failed the overall test

In order for a model to fail the test, emissions from the additive-fueled vehicles must be sufficiently high that then
percent of the represented fleet of that model group using the additive is predicted to exceed the standard beofre
the end of its useful life. The control vehicles must reach this failure rate at a higher mileage than the additive-fueled

These ``confidence levels'' correspond, respectively, to the 0.10 and 0.05 significance levels. The significance
level is the probability that a decision to reject the null hypothesis (and find an increase) will be a result of sampling
error and thus be incorrect.

If the newer technology 1992 and 1993 vehicles tested by the applicant are examined in isolation from the earlier test
programs, the data (with an average HC effect of 0.002 gm/mi) pass the historical tests even more easily than is the
case for the data combinations examined above. None of the nine models failed the ``cause or contribute'' test for
hydrocarbons and only one failed for carbon monoxide. Seven of nine models would have to fail for the additive to fail
the overall sign test at the 90 percent confidence level and eight would have to fail for 95 percent confidence. The
overall conclusion from the above analysis, then, is that Ethyl's additive passes the most critical of the historical
tests with a comfortable margin.

The tests are extremely conservative in that they place most of the burden of proof on the Agency rather than on the applicant.
The ``cause or contribute'' test is failed by an engine family only under circumstances where emissions from the family
are so high that an additive_caused increase in some pollutant pushes more than ten percent of the vehicle fleet into
violation of the standard. Moreover, the final sign test that is applied to the model-specific results is failed by
the additive only when it may be concluded with high confidence that more than half of the models in the represented
population would fail the model-specific test. In practical situations with relatively small samples, this sign
test permits a high percentage of the models in the sample to fail before the additive is declared to have failed the
test. These tests, then, may permit the granting of waivers in the face of substantively significant emissions increments
attributable to an additive_increments that would tend to offset the benefits from an increasingly stringent regulatory
program aimed at bringing the nation's most serious air quality problems under control. Agency concerns with these
tests were addressed previously in its decision on Ethyl's 1990 application (57 FR 2535, January 22, 1992) and in (58
FR 64761, December 9, 1993).

Therefore, EPA has gone beyond the historical tests to examine Ethyl's data on the use of the additive with newer technology
vehicles under more stringent criteria of the sort that seem to be warranted by current conditions. For this analysis,
EPA chose to examine the additive's performance against the most stringent of the possible criteria_a requirement
that the additive cause no statistically significant increase in emissions. If one uses a one-sided null hypothesis
that the additive causes no increase in HC emissions, one may employ various statistical tests to examine the credibility
of that hypothesis in light of the test results. One such test is the computer-intensive ``permutation test'' in a
form called an ``approximate randomization'' test.
<FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>
 Application of this test to the full mileage range of HC emissions data from Ethyl's tests of 1992 and 1993 vehicles
results in a failure to discern any ``real'' emissions increase at all_that is, no increase that we may not reasonably
attribute to sampling error rather than to an additive effect on HC in the sampled vehicle population.

The permutation test is built around the idea that, if the null hypothesis is correct, the increase due to the additive
in the sample is only one member of a distribution of all possible such increases computed from assignments of vehicle
emissions to fuel groups within models. Only if the fuel-related increase from the sample is an extremely unusual
result in theis distribution of possible increases is it reasonable to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
the additive actually brought about an increase in emissions. The way that this method works in practice is that, on
each iteration of the computer program, the computer randomly rearranges the fuel group assignments among the emission
results within each model group separately. The emission values assigned (for that iteration) to the additive fuel
group are then summed over the entire sample to form the test statistic. This process is repeated a very large number
of times (one million in this case) and the resulting test statistics are tabulated. Only if the same test statistic,
as computed from the empirical sample, exceeds a pre-determined percentage of the simulated test statistics may
we reject the ``no-difference'' hypothesis and conclude with the necessary degree of certainty that an increase
has occurred.

This conclusion holds even when the test is performed at the 0.10 significance level used in conducting the statistical
testing on the data from Ethyl's 1978 application. It is important to note that the original Ethyl test fleet of 1988
model year vehicles that are now older than those representing the newest Ethyl data set did not fare as well and, as
mentioned previously, do demonstrate statistically significant increases in HC emissions.

E. Finding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on all of the information then available concerning the potential effect of use of MMT in unleaded gasoline on
regulated emissions, as submitted by Ethyl and others, the Administrator of EPA determined on November 30, 1994 that,
``Ethyl has satisfied its burden under Clean Air Act 211(f)(4) to establish that use of HiTEC 3000 at the specified
concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device or system (over the useful life
of any vehicle in which such device or system is used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standards
with respect to which it has been certified.'' The basis for this determination was described briefly in the Administrator's
November 30, 1994 notice, and has been reviewed in detail above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 30, 1994 determination was specific to Ethyl's present waiver application. As the Administrator made
clear in the notice announcing the determination, it does not apply to any new application concerning either HiTEC
3000 or MMT in the event that this decision to deny Ethyl's application on the basis of concerns regarding potential
health effects is upheld in any subsequent judicial review. Although Ethyl may be able to sustain its burden under
Section 211(f)(4) in the context of any future waiver application, any such application must include satisfactory
data addressing the effect on vehicles in production at that time and will be evaluated according to the statistical
methods and criteria for evaluation of waiver applications in effect at that time.

Prior to the Administrator's November 30, 1994 finding

concerning emission effects, three auto manufacturers, Ford, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Motors (GM), and Chrysler, and the American Automobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufacturers Association (AAMA), all commented on concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact of the oxidative products of MMT on onboard diagnostic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OBD II) systems employing before-catalyst and after-catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen sensors.

An Onboard Diagnostic System, with the present generation commonly known as OBD&hyph;II, monitors the activity
of an automobile's emission control system, primarily the catalytic converter, and alerts the driver via a dashboard
light in the event of a malfunction. Put simply, this aspect of the OBD system functions by utilizing devices before
and after the catalyst which ``sense'' the presence of oxygen. If the catalyst is functioning properly, it will absorb
a certain amount of oxygen and a specified decrease in oxygen content in the exhaust gases can be determined by comparing
the oxygen ``sensed'' before and after the catalyst. If the catalyst is functioning improperly, oxygen storage by
the catalyst is impaired and a drop in exhaust gas oxygen after the catalyst beyond the proper range is ``sensed'' by
the OBD system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GM concerns regarding the OBD II system were two-fold. Its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first concern was that since it is known that manganese oxide has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability to store oxygen, a potential problem could occur with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dual oxygen sensor systems. GM stated that, with manganese oxide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covering the catalyst and the oxygen sensors, a false oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage capacity of the catalyst could be indicated by the OBD II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, which could then indicate that the catalyst was still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working properly while the opposite could be true. GM's second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern was that the catalyst would act as a ``filter'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese oxide from MMT combustion passing through the exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system would coat the before-catalyst oxygen sensor and after-catalyst oxygen sensors unevenly, thus causing the
OBD II system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to malfunction. GM also stated that in the 1994 model year GM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planned to market two engine families equipped with OBD II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems employing before- and after-catalyst oxygen sensors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the automakers' concern that use of MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would adversely affect operation of the OBD II system, on July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15, 1993, Ethyl submitted data which it believed demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this concern has no basis.
<FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>
 Ethyl stated that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production vehicles were then equipped with OBD&hyph;II systems and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the primary hardware approach being considered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automobile manufacturers involves the use of exhaust gas oxygen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(EGO) sensors before and after the catalytic converter to monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converter efficiency. Ethyl further commented that test data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated by Ethyl showed that use of the additive would have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effect on either the hardware component of these planned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ODB&hyph;II systems (i.e., the oxygen sensors), or on the catalytic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
converter itself. Ethyl noted that, ``[s]ince these future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems are currently under development, it is impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the long term effects of MMT on these systems.''

Company submitted a report describing bench testing
<FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalysts, in which Ford measured the oxygen storage capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalysts which had been deliberately degraded and then exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the emissions from MMT-containing fuel. Ford's conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on these tests was that the exhaust gas oxygen (EGO) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensors would be affected by the deposition of manganese oxides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with MMT use, thus sending incorrect signals to the

Although the Agency regarded the concerns expressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford in its November 4, 1994 submission regarding the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT use on OBD systems as potentially very important, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the very limited analysis which could be undertaken prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1994 deadline for a decision concerning Ethyl's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application, the Agency concluded that the limited bench testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by Ford did not allow a conclusion concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood that a significant impact would actually occur during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle operation. In addition, the Agency had several questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the procedures involved in the Ford testing which could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be resolved within the available time. The November 30, 1994

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission effects made it clear that EPA was concerned about this

issue and would retain the authority to take appropriate action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the future pursuant to Clean Air Act Section 211(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA met with staff of Ford in February of 1994 in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss Ford's concerns raised in its November 4, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission. Ford generally expressed the same concerns as had

been expressed by GM (and discussed above).

MMT deposits a layer of manganese oxide on top of the catalyst

washcoat and that this causes the EGO Sensor to measure a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen level, thereby indicating a higher oxygen storage capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than that which would be indicated by the catalyst without MMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, a malfunctioning catalyst might not be detected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford expressed particular concern because it had just introduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three 1994 model year vehicle families employing OBD&hyph;II, whereas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other automakers will not have systems out until the 1996 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model year.

information which the Agency is currently reviewing. This new

information appears to provide further evidence to substantiate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concerns expressed by Ford regarding the impact of MMT use on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OBD systems. Unlike the previously submitted Ford data, the new

data address an actual production vehicle fitted with a failed

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) assessed the potential health risks associated with the
use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) as an additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in unleaded gasoline (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990).
<FOOTCITE>53</FOOTCITE>
 Later, ORD (Preuss, 1991) reaffirmed its assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after considering a resubmitted waiver application for MMT from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl Corporation. As identified in earlier ORD evaluations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990; Preuss, 1991), a key 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue is the potential health risk associated with inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to manganese tetroxide (Mn

), which is the primary by-product resulting from the combustion of MMT in gasoline. New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on manganese (Mn) health effects and exposure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The toxicity of Mn varies according to the route of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. By ingestion, Mn has relatively low toxicity at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical exposure levels due in part to a low rate of absorption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the gastrointestinal tract and in part to efficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation by homeostatic mechanisms. Manganese is considered a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nutritionally essential trace element and is required for certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enzymes important for normal functioning of the central nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and other body organs. However, by inhalation, Mn has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been known since the early 1800s to be toxic to workers. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be noted that Mn occupational studies predominantly (and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sometimes exclusively) involve men. Neurobehavioral, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory, and reproductive effects are the primary features of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive occupational exposure to Mn. Manganism is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterized by various psychiatric and movement disorders, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some general resemblance to Parkinson's disease in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulties in the fine control of some movements, lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facial expression, and involvement of underlying neuroanatomical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and neurochemical factors. Neurobehavioral effects of Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intoxication are generally more clinically prominent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory or reproductive effects. However, respiratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects (e.g., pneumonitis) and reproductive dysfunction (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced libido) are also frequently reported features of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational Mn intoxication. The available evidence is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate to determine whether or not Mn is carcinogenic; some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports suggest that it may even be protective against cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this mixed but insufficient evidence, EPA has placed Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a Group D weight-of-evidence category, which signifies that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity. Given these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
features of Mn toxicity, the health assessment focuses on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for chronic noncancer effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various epidemiological studies of male workers exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn at average levels below the current American Conference of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Value (TLV) (5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 have shown neurobehavioral, reproductive, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory effects, both by objective testing methods and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers' self-reported symptoms on questionnaires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurobehavioral effects generally have reflected disturbances in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control of hand movements (e.g., tremor, reduced hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steadiness) and/or the speed of movement (e.g., longer reaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, slower finger-tapping speed). Reproductive effects have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included a decrease in the number of children born to Mn-exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers (compared to matched controls) and various self-reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms of sexual dysfunction. In recent studies at low to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate occupational exposure levels, respiratory effects have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reflected primarily in self-reported symptoms of respiratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tract illnesses rather than in differences between objective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pulmonary function measurements in Mn-exposed and control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers. However, the lack of studies using more sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigational methods and the existence of some limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence from an epidemiological study of school children raise a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of concern about pulmonary function effects in relation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower level Mn exposure.

The precise mechanisms of Mn neurotoxicity are not well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understood, but it appears that Mn can affect several different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function and structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some experimental evidence suggests that the mechanisms of Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity may depend on the oxidation state of Mn. However, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the trivalent form (Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the divalent form (Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated to be neurotoxic.
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 Also, both forms of Mn can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross the blood-brain barrier, although research suggests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is predominantly transported bound to the protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferrin (Aschner and Gannon, 1994), whereas Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the brain independently of such a transport mechanism (Murphy et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al., 1991). Unlike ingested Mn, inhaled Mn is transported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from the respiratory system to the vicinity of the brain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before its first pass by the liver. Depending on the form of Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhaled, its conversion to other oxidation states (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxidation of Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or reduction of Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to Mn
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3+
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to enter the brain (through a protein transport mechanism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or otherwise), it is quite possible that a significant fraction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of even small amounts of inhaled Mn would be able to reach target 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites in the CNS. Thus, the apparently greater toxicity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhaled versus ingested Mn may reflect important pharmacodynamic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pharmacokinetic differences of Mn that enters the body by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different routes. A more definitive understanding of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues will require more empirical information.

Various elements can exist in more than one form of charged atom, depending on the number of negatively charged and
positively charged particles contained in the atom. Manganese is one such element where, depending on the number
of charged particles associated with the atom, the atom may have a net charge of two or three ``plus'' charges resulting
in a ``divalent'' or ``trivalent'' form, respectively.

2. Earlier Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Earlier ORD health assessments have been based on the RfC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the human population (including sensitive subpopulations) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is likely to be without appreciable risk of deleterious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncancer effects during a lifetime. The basic procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derivation of an RfC entails identifying a no-observed-adverse- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect level (NOAEL) and a lowest-observed-adverse-effect level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(LOAEL) from a ``principal'' study, generally defined as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available study that best defines the highest NOAEL or lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOAEL for the most sensitive endpoint affected by a chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an investigation of occupationally exposed humans is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal study (as in the case of the Mn RfC), the NOAEL or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOAEL is adjusted for differences in ventilation rates and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure durations between the occupational exposure scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10 m3 air breathed per 8-h workday, 5 days/week) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``general public'' scenario (20 m3 air breathed per 24-h day, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7 days/week). The adjusted NOAEL or LOAEL is then divided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty factors and a modifying factor. In the case of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original (1990) RfC for Mn, uncertainty factors of 10 each were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for extrapolating from a healthy worker population to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general population (including sensitive subpopulations) and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAEL. Also, an uncertainty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of 3 (approximately one-half of 10 on a log scale) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for extrapolating from subchronic to chronic exposure. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying factor of 3 was used because of statements by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authors of the principal study (Roels et al., 1987) that past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels of workers in the subject study were probably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower than those measured at the time the study was conducted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting RfC of 0.4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g Mn/m3 was used for the earlier ORD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was entered on EPA's IRIS computer database of human health risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and regulatory information in December 1990.

3. 1993 Revised RfC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The original RfC for Mn was revised, in part, because newer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information supplied in conjunction with the resubmittal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT waiver application by Ethyl indicated that the workers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels in the principal study had probably not increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over time, and thus the modifying factor could be ``eliminated'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., set equal to 1). Another reason for revising the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RfC was that more recent studies (Roels et al., 1992; Mergler et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al., 1994) provided additional evidence of health effects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers at relatively low airborne concentrations of Mn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Independently of their earlier study of Mn-exposed workers (Roels et al., 1987), Roels et al. (1992) conducted a cross-sectional
study of neurobehavioral and other endpoints in another group of workers from a different factory-namely, 92 male
alkaline-battery plant workers exposed to manganese dioxide (MnO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) dust_who were compared to a matched control group of 101 male workers without industrial Mn exposure. The geometric
mean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational-lifetime integrated respirable dust concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was 793 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g Mn/m3 &times; years (range: 40 to 4,433). The equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value for total dust was 3,505 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g Mn/m3 &times; years (range: 191 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27,465). The authors noted that the monitored concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were representative of the usual exposures of the workers because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work practices had not changed during the last 15 years of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant's operation. No data on particle size or chemical purity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were provided in the report by Roels et al. (1992), but based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information provided by Roels et al. (1992) and Roels (1993), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
median cut point for the respirable dust fraction was 5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
m 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aerodynamic diameter. The respirable fraction is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative of the toxicologically significant particles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., the smaller particles that are inhaled and deposit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predominantly in the lower respiratory tract). Total dust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements comprised the respirable dust as well as larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particles that deposit predominantly in the nose and throat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
region (via nasal breathing) and would be cleared more rapidly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the respiratory tract than the smaller particles retained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lower regions. Therefore, the respirable dust measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were considered to be a more accurate indicator of exposure in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relation to the observed health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manganese-exposed workers in the 1992 study by Roels et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed significantly worse than matched controls on several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of neurobehavioral function, particularly visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaction time, eye-hand coordination, and hand steadiness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar neurobehavioral impairments were also found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier study by Roels et al. (1987) of a different occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population exposed to mixed Mn oxides and salts at approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same levels of total dust (respirable dust was not measured). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a recent study in Canada by Mergler et al. (1994) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that, among other effects, performance on tests of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to make rapid alternating hand movements, to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand steadiness, and to perform other aspects of fine motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control was significantly worse, compared to matched controls, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers who were exposed to even lower concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirable dust (35 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g Mn/m3 at the time of the study). If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mergler et al. had included information on integrated past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels (which they have since provided to ORD in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preliminary form not yet submitted for publication), their study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have provided a fivefold lower LOAEL for the derivation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RfC. In addition, reports of a Swedish study of Mn-exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steel workers (Iregren, 1990; Wennberg et al., 1991, 1992) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided compelling evidence of comparable neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairments, including slower reaction time and finger-tapping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speed. The median total dust concentration in the Swedish study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was 140 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g Mn/m3, with respirable dust reported as constituting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 to 80% of individual workers' total dust exposures. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOAEL from this study would be somewhat lower than that from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roels et al. (1992), but the less fully characterized exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histories in the Swedish study made it more appropriate as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting (rather than principal) study for deriving the Mn RfC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Taken together, the above epidemiological studies provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent pattern of evidence indicating that neurotoxicity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with low-level occupational Mn exposure. The fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that speed and coordination of motor function are especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired is particularly noteworthy, given its consistency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other epidemiological, clinical, and experimental animal evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of higher concentration Mn intoxication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differences among these studies in the duration of workers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to Mn raise another issue of relevance to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion. In the Roels et al. (1992) study, the mean period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure was 5.3 years (range: 0.2 to 17.7 years). In the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies, the mean durations of exposure were longer: 7.1 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Roels et al. (1987), 9.9 years in Iregren (1990), and 16.7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years in Mergler et al. (1994). The indications of lower LOAELs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Canadian and Swedish studies suggest that neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects might occur at lower concentrations of Mn if the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods were longer. In addition, the age of the workers may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an important factor in interpreting these findings. The oldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker in the Roels et al. (1992) study was less than 50 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
old; also, the average age in that study was only 31.3 years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus 34.3 years in Roels et al. (1987), 43.4 years in Mergler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et al. (1994), and 46.4 years in Iregren (1990). These points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggest that longer exposure and/or testing later in life might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the detection of effects at lower concentrations than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is possible after shorter periods of exposure and/or in younger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers. On the other hand, it is also evident from these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies that a much shorter period than a full lifetime of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational Mn exposure may be sufficient to induce Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As Roels et al. (1992) and other investigators have noted, a threshold for the neurotoxic effects of Mn has not been
reported in the epidemiological literature. Therefore, instead of a NOAEL, a LOAEL was obtained from the study by
Roels et al. (1992) by dividing the geometric mean integrated respirable dust concentration (793 &mu;g Mn/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 &times; years) by the average period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker exposure (5.3 years) to eliminate time (in years) from the time-weighted average, thereby yielding a LOAEL
of 150 &mu;g Mn/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(The geometric mean concentration was used to represent the average exposure because the workers' exposure measurements
were log-normally distributed, and the arithmetic mean exposure period was used because it was the only value reported
by Roels et al. (1992).) The workplace-based LOAEL of 150 &mu;g Mn/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was then adjusted for nonoccupational lifetime exposure by multiplying it by (1) the quotient of 10 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/day divided by 20 m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
/day (for worker versus nonworker ventilation rates) and (2) the quotient of 5 days divided by 7 days (for work week
versus full week). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting adjusted LOAEL, labeled the human equivalent concentration (HEC), was 50 &mu;g Mn/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which was then divided by a total uncertainty factor of 1,000 to yield an RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total uncertainty factor of 1,000 incorporated the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors: 10 to protect sensitive individuals; 10 for using a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOAEL in lieu of a NOAEL; and a composite factor of 10 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
database limitations reflecting the less-than-chronic periods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure and the lack of reproductive and developmental toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, as well as potential but unquantified differences in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of different forms of Mn. A modifying factor was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used (i.e., it was set equal to 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each RfC is assigned an overall rating of low, medium, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high confidence level, based on two subsidiary confidence ratings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflecting the quality of the evidence from the principal studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the quality of the overall database for the chemical in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question, respectively. The revised Mn RfC was assigned a medium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level of confidence. The evidence for the neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of low-level Mn exposure by inhalation was compelling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent across several well-conducted studies. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited duration of exposure and the lack of a NOAEL for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity in any of the principal or supporting studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevented assigning a confidence level greater than medium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the lack of definitive data on the concentration-response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship and on the potential reproductive and developmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of inhaled Mn limited the degree of confidence in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
database to a medium rating. Virtually all of the human health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence is based on healthy, adult male workers. No known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies have investigated human female reproductive function, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even though male worker reproductive function is known to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by Mn exposure, it has not received adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation. The limited available information concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental toxicity of inhaled Mn suggests the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that prenatal exposure of laboratory rodents to MnO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (via the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplied to the pregnant mother) may depress neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity in neonatal rats and that continued postnatal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the pups may intensify this depression. In addition, several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies have demonstrated alterations in neurochemical (dopamine) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels in young mice and rats exposed during early postnatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development to Mn via other routes. Thus, the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental toxicity due to Mn exposure exists. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations and durations of exposure sufficient to induce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such effects are not known. Although adequate epidemiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies of children and the elderly have not been conducted, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is known that certain populations, such as children, pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women, elderly persons, iron- or calcium-deficient individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and individuals with liver impairment, may have an increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for excessive Mn body burdens due to increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorption or altered clearance mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another concern raised by the lack of studies involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer periods of exposure and/or older subjects is that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensatory or reserve capacity of certain neurological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms may be stressed by Mn exposure earlier in life, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manifestations of impairments only becoming evident much later, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps at a geriatric stage. One reason for the latter concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is that Parkinson's disease is typically a geriatric disease in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which symptoms are only seen when the loss of brain cells that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce dopamine (which is also apparently involved in Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity) reaches 80% or more. Indeed, some neurologists think 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a long latency period of perhaps several decades may precede 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various parkinsonian syndromes. These points lead to a concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that if Mn reduces the compensatory or reserve capacity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system, parkinsonian-type effects might occur earlier in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life than they would otherwise. Thus, several questions remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be answered before higher confidence in the accuracy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RfC can be achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two studies of Roels et al. (1992, 1987) were considered coprincipal studies for the derivation of the revised
RfC, with supporting evidence in the reports of Mergler et al. (1994), Iregren (1990), and Wennberg et al. (1991, 1992).
Given the fact that these studies involved exposure to various oxides and salts of Mn, the RfC is designated as applying
to Mn and Mn compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(including Mn

3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 applied to Mn only, due to undifferentiated forms of Mn in the principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study. Given that different forms of metals may have different toxic properties (due to different oxidation states,
different solubilities, and possibly other factors), it is likely that different compounds of Mn vary in toxicity.
However, sufficient data on the comparative toxicity of various compounds of Mn are not available to judge the relative
toxicity of Mn

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, Mn affects multiple organ systems, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the respiratory and reproductive systems as well as the CNS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, because the only available evidence suggests that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CNS is the most sensitive target for Mn toxicity, neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints were the focus of the RfC derivation. Although other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of effects remain a concern, it is presumed, based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited data now available, that protecting against neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides protection against these other, apparently less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive endpoints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In revising the RfC for Mn, a draft version was subjected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peer review by external experts (from academic and non-EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental institutions) as well as internal experts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following this peer review, a further-revised version was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to and verified by an EPA-wide RfD/RfC work group in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1993. The current RfC for Mn was made available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through IRIS in early November 1993 through two mechanisms. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special notice beginning November 1 in the news section of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal IRIS2 database announced the availability of a hard copy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the text to EPA requesters who contacted the Risk Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hotline; also, the text was obtainable through the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Library of Medicine's publicly accessible on-line computer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
database, TOXNET, beginning November 10, 1993. It also became 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available on line via the EPA IRIS database beginning December 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993.

4. Alternative Approaches to Deriving RfCs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the revised RfC for Mn became available to the public, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl Corporation and other interested parties submitted comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the RfC and issues related to it. One of the primary comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned the availability of various statistical techniques for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deriving a NOAEL from the study by Roels et al. (1992) and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from supplementary data for that study provided to ORD by Roels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993). In response to Ethyl Corporation's request that EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider alternative approaches to analyzing these data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deriving an RfC for Mn, further analyses of the subject data were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertaken using a variety of statistical methods. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches may be identified as (1) conventional NOAEL- or LOAEL- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based analyses, (2) ``no statistical significance of trend'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NOSTASOT) analyses of the type described by Tukey et al. (1985), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) benchmark dose analyses of the type described by Crump 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1984), and (4) Bayesian analyses of the type described by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jarabek and Hasselblad (1991). These analyses and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 yield several possible RfC estimates, so designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the current and only verified RfC for Mn is that which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been verified by the EPA-wide RfD/RfC work group and entered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on IRIS. It must be emphasized that the RfC estimates developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the purpose of this risk assessment do not represent a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision of the current verified RfC for Mn. Reexamination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current Mn RfC, and any decision to revise or reaffirm the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current RfC, will be under the purview of the EPA-wide RfD/RfC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
work group at some future date.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A fundamental issue pertaining to all of the approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented here is the selection of a measure of exposure. Roels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et al. (1992) described two measures of respirable dust, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational lifetime respirable dust concentration (LIRD), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed as &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 x years, and the current concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respirable dust (CRD), expressed as &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The CRD concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was measured at the time the study was conducted by Roels et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and refers to a representative concentration measured for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of job performed by a worker (e.g., electrician, maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker). The LIRD value for each worker was a cumulative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure measure derived by adding the CRD values over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker's entire period of employment. If a worker changed jobs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the plant during his period of employment, the CRD for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each job held was multiplied by the number of years the worker 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed that job. Thus, if more than one job classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was worked, the worker's LIRD was the sum of the products of CRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiplied by years of performance of the respective jobs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a worker held only one job classification, his LIRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was simply equal to his CRD multiplied by the number of years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed. Another measure of exposure may be derived from LIRD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by dividing an individual worker's LIRD value by his total number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of years of employment. The latter measure, designated as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average concentration of respirable dust (ACRD), reflects a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker's time-weighted cumulative exposure level but removes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years from the unit of measurement of LIRD and is expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although Roels et al. (1992) did not refer to ACRD, this value could be calculated for each individual and for the entire

cohort by using the unpublished data provided to ORD by Roels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993). For reasons to be discussed later, ACRD offers

Conventional NOAEL- or LOAEL-Based Approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The conventional method, and only method used thus far by EPA, to derive an RfC has been to identify a NOAEL or LOAEL
from a study and divide that concentration by uncertainty factors, as described above for the Mn RfC. In the case of
the study by Roels et al. (1992), the geometric mean LIRD concentration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn-exposed workers was used as a LOAEL. Roels et al. (1992) also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed an exposure-response analysis of their data by grouping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exposed workers into three exposure categories and comparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prevalence of abnormal neurobehavioral scores for each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three groups to those of controls. As indicated in the summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheet for the Mn RfC (see Appendix C), the results of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure-response analysis were not used in deriving the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn RfC because the reported analysis did not correct for multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparisons. However, ORD's analyses of additional data provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Roels (1993) suggest a possible RfC estimate of 0.03 &mu;g/m

3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

(versus the current RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

b. NOSTASOT Approach
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Another approach to analyzing dose-response data makes use of a procedure known as NOSTASOT, described by Tukey
et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1985). In essence, the procedure applies a trend test sequentially to determine the highest noneffective dose of
a series of doses by eliminating one dose at a time. In this manner, the dose level at which the response is not significantly
different from controls is determined to be the NOSTASOT dose, which could therefore be considered a NOAEL. Applied
to Roels' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993) epidemiologic data by beginning with the highest individual ACRD exposure and moving downward (i.e., a ``top-down''
approach), the procedure yielded a NOSTASOT of 285 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for eye-hand coordination (see Table A&hyph;4, Appendix A). This approach implies that once nonsignificance is
reached, further application of trend tests to lower dose groups would also yield 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonsignificance. However, this was not the case with Roels' (1993) epidemiologic data, and thus it was important
to determine not simply the highest NOAEL but the highest NOAEL below the lowest LOAEL. By this ``bottom-up'' approach,
the highest nonsignificant exposure below the lowest statistically significant exposure was 21 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for visual reaction time. Using the latter value as a NOAEL and a total uncertainty factor of 100 (the same as that used
for the current Mn RfC, except omitting a factor of 10 for extrapolating from a LOAEL to a NOAEL), one would obtain a value
of 0.07 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for an RfC estimate (Figure 1). Disparities in the NOSTASOTs obtained for various endpoints by the top-down and bottom-up
approaches raise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions about the suitability of this technique for deriving a NOAEL from the data of Roels (1993).

c. Benchmark Analyses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another approach to deriving an RfC estimate is the benchmark dose (BMD) approach, which has been described by Crump
(1984) and others (e.g., Kimmel and Gaylor, 1988; Faustman et al., 1994; Allen et al., 1994). A BMD is an estimate of
the dose (the term dose is used interchangeably here with concentration, although the latter is more appropriate
for inhalation exposure) that will produce a specified effect (e.g., a 10% increase in the prevalence of abnormal
scores on a neurobehavioral test in the case of the study by Roels et al. (1992)). The BMD is calculated by fitting a mathematical
model to the available data and obtaining a maximum likelihood estimate of the dose associated with a specified increase
in response (typically 10, 5, or 1%). A lower confidence limit is then calculated for the BMD (usually the 95th percentile),
and the result is denoted as a benchmark dose level (BMDL), which has been proposed as a substitute for a NOAEL in deriving
RfDs or RfCs (Crump, 1984; Barnes et al., 1994). Subscripts designate the effect level (10, 5, or 1%) for which the BMDL
has been calculated, as in BMDL

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of mathematical models could be used for deriving BMDLs, but six frequently used models have been selected
for the present exercise (as discussed in Appendix A). In applying these models to the dataset provided by Roels (1993),
it appears that the models fit the CRD and ACRD data better than the LIRD data. (As explained in Appendix A, it made little
difference whether the LIRD values were obtained from the group data provided in the report by Roels et al. (1992) or
from the individual exposure data supplied by Roels (1993), so the latter LIRD data were used here.) In principle,
LIRD is superior to CRD as a measure of long-term or cumulative exposure. One reason for the difference in goodness
of fit between LIRD and either CRD or ACRD is that two workers with low LIRD values had abnormal eye-hand coordination
responses (exceeding the 95th percentile of control scores). These two subjects appear to have had rather short exposure
durations (0.3 and 0.4 years) and moderately high CRD values (201 &mu;g/m3 each). Thus, these two data points suggest
an LIRD exposure-response relationship that is better fit by a supralinear curve with a power term &lt;1 (see Figures
A&hyph;3 and A&hyph;5 in Appendix A) than by the more nearly linear curve such as that produced by the quantal linear
or restricted Weibull model (see Figures A&hyph;1 and A&hyph;4 in Appendix A). If CRD or ACRD exposure data are used,
however, the two individuals tend to fall in line better with a linear model (see Figures A&hyph;7 to A&hyph;10 in Appendix
A). Another factor contributing to difficulty in fitting the Roels (1993) data with linear models is a tendency for
the prevalence of abnormal eye-hand coordination responses to decline slightly at the highest LIRD, CRD, and ACRD
concentrations (evident in Figures A&hyph;1 to A&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The supralinear exposure-response curve for abnormal eye-hand coordination scores suggests a possible corollary
to the healthy worker phenomenon; namely, the existence of newly employed, relatively sensitive workers vis-&aacute;-vis
long-term, relatively nonsensitive workers. It may be that the two above-noted workers happened to be rather susceptible
to Mn toxicity but had not been employed long enough for their greater sensitivity to become otherwise evident. There
could be a tendency for such workers to move to other types of employment, leaving a greater proportion of relatively
less sensitive individuals among the older workers. Although irregularities of the type posed by the data for these
two workers create complexities for model fitting, it is important to recognize that statistical curve fitting is
secondary to the objective of selecting the most biologically appropriate exposure variable. However, given that
the final results obtained with LIRD, CRD, and ACRD are roughly equivalent, ACRD has been selected for discussion
here because it estimates an average exposure over time and yet provides as good or better goodness of fit as CRD or LIRD
for most of the models considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the six models considered, the quantal linear model fits the data reasonably well and is the least complex (see Appendix
A). It also gives equivalent results to the restricted Weibull model for BMDL calculations (although the two models
differ slightly when used in the Bayesian analyses, to be described below). Although much more conservative results
would be obtained if the unrestricted Weibull or unrestricted log-logistic model were used, the NOAEL/LOAEL surrogates
obtained with the latter models are so small as to be practicably incalculable and extend far below the range of actual
measurements. Therefore, the following discussion is focused on the results obtained with the quantal linear model.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to choosing a model, a specified rate of increase in the effect of concern must be selected in using the BMD
approach. This percentage increment is expressed in terms of the effective concentration that would yield the stated
increase. Increases of 10, 5, and 1% in the incidence of abnormal eye-hand coordination scores (as dichotomized by
Roels et al., 1992) have been considered, with the concentrations associated with these levels called ``effective
concentrations'' and designated as EC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and EC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, respectively. One guide to the choice of an effect level is that the resulting BMD (before calculating the lower confidence
limit) is preferably near or within the range of observed exposure concentrations (cf. Barnes et al., 1994). Because
the BMD for EC
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 falls outside this range of observed concentrations, the primary focus in this discussion is devoted to the BMDL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the BMDL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be kept in mind that the BMDL represents the lower 95th percent confidence interval for the effective concentration
in question, and therefore the BMDL probably inherently reflects some degree of conservatism. However, the degree
of conservatism obviously varies with the effective concentration for different percentage effect levels and with
the nature of the effect (e.g., severe versus moderate impairment). For the purposes of this assessment, if one treats
the BMDL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 derived from the dichotomized (quantal) data of Roels as if it were a minimal (less severe) LOAEL and the BMDL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as if it were a NOAEL, uncertainty factors of 3 and 1, respectively, would be warranted. On this basis, as shown in Figure
1 and in Table A&hyph;39 of Appendix A for the quantal linear model using ACRD, an RfC estimate of 0.09 &mu;g/m3 would
be obtained by using the quantal BMDL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as if it were a LOAEL and a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity, 10 for database limitations,
and 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Similarly, the quantal BMDL
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 would yield an RfC estimate of 0.1 &mu;g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity,
10 for database limitations, and 1 for a NOAEL). As applied here, the benchmark approach yields candidate RfC estimates
of 0.09 to 0.1 &mu;g/m3.

d. Bayesian Analyses. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another approach to deriving a substitute for a conventional LOAEL or NOAEL, which bears some resemblance to the BMD
approach just described, is known as the Bayesian approach (see Appendix A). In essence, the Bayesian approach yields
a distribution of concentrations (rather than a point estimate) associated with a specified effect. Some features
of the BMD approach are common to the Bayesian approach: a mathematical model must be fit to the data, an effect level
must be selected, and a confidence bound on the estimated concentration associated with a given effect level must
be calculated (although the calculation procedures are different). If these choices are consistent with those for
the BMD approach, the results are quite similar. By the Bayesian analysis, for a 10% increase in abnormal eye-hand
coordination scores, the lower 90% credible set limit (roughly equivalent to the quantal BMDL 95% confidence limit
<FOOTCITE>59</FOOTCITE>
 based on the estimated median concentration obtained with the quantal linear model is 73 &mu;g/m3. Adjusting this
value to a human equivalent concentration (HEC) and treating the result (26 &mu;g/m3) as if it were a LOAEL(HEC), one
may divide by a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity, 10 for database limitations, and
3 for a minimal severity LOAEL) and obtain an RfC estimate of 0.09 &mu;g/m3. Similarly, the 5% effect level yields an
RfC estimate of 0.1 &mu;g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100. Thus, as applied here, the Bayesian approach
yields candidate RfC estimates of 0.09 to 0.1 &mu;g/m3, essentially identical to the results of the benchmark analysis
(Figure 1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it lends itself well to using continuous as well as dichotomous data.
Although Roels et al. (1992) did not provide individual continuous data (i.e., actual raw scores instead of designations
of normal/abnormal) on the performance of the workers in their study, they did report mean differences and standard
deviations. With this information, it is possible to estimate the concentration at which certain effect levels would
occur based on the Bayesian posterior distribution. For example, a 10% increase in the proportion of subjects with
abnormal scores would be associated with a median concentration of 112 &mu;g/m3, which has a lower 90% credible set
limit of 90 &mu;g/m3. Adjusting the latter value as if it were a LOAEL(HEC) yields a concentration of 32 &mu;g/m3 and
an RfC estimate value of 0.1 &mu;g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 300 (10 for intraspecies sensitivity,
10 for database limitations, and 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Note that these calculations based on continuous
data essentially approximate the quantal BMD and Bayesian calculations for a 10% effect level based on dichotomous
data (see Figure 1). Similar calculations for the actually observed difference (i.e., 13%) between the Mn-exposed
and control workers in the Roels et al. (1992) study yield an RfC estimate of 0.2 &mu;g/m3, based on a total uncertainty
factor of 300 (including a factor of 3 for a minimal severity LOAEL). Calculating the concentration associated with
the difference between the exposed and control mean values that just achieves statistical significance (a 4% difference
in this case) also results in a candidate RfC value of 0.2 &mu;g/m3, based on a total uncertainty factor of 100 (eliminating
the minimal LOAEL factor of 3). Thus, as applied here, the Bayesian analyses of continuous data yield candidate RfC
estimates of 0.1 to 0.2 &mu;g/m3.

e. Summary of RfC Estimates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Figure 1 displays the current, verified RfC along with over 100 possible Mn RfC estimates based on various exposure
measures, models, effects measures, and uncertainty factors. Not all of these RfC estimates are equally plausible
or worthy of consideration in assessing the potential health risks associated with Mn inhalation exposure due to
MMT usage. As discussed above, some combinations of the three exposure measures and six mathematical models fit one
another better than other combinations. Based primarily on considerations of cumulative dose toxicity, statistical
goodness-of-fit, and parsimony, ACRD and the quantal linear model appear to achieve the best results in this respect.
Given the similarities of the benchmark and Bayesian analytic results using ACRD and the quantal linear model, little
distinction can be made between the two analytic approaches in the present application. As for the results obtained
for different effect levels, using a severity uncertainty factor of 3 with a 10% effect level (for either benchmark
or Bayesian analyses) is essentially equivalent to using a severity UF of 1 with a 5% effect level. Note that the terms
LOAEL and NOAEL do not actually correspond to the results for 10% and 5% effect levels, and therefore neither is preferable
to the other in the sense that a NOAEL is preferable to a LOAEL in deriving an RfC. Therefore, benchmark and Bayesian
results for 10% and 5% effect levels (using ACRD with the quantal linear model) are regarded as equally worthy of consideration
here. These particular analyses yield Mn RfC estimates of 0.09 to 0.1 &mu;g/m3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, continuous response data are preferred to dichotomized data, primarily because they provide more information
and avoid the basically arbitrary division of effect measurements into categories (e.g., normal versus abnormal).
The Bayesian analysis based on mean differences between exposed and control groups offers some of the advantages
of using continuous data, in that the reported means and standard deviations (from Roels et al., 1992) provide a basis
for estimating the distribution of continuous response measures. However, this use of continuous data is not immune
to certain common problems, such as the issue of statistical power associated with studies of limited size, for the
approaches calculating observed or just-statistically significant differences. Also, whereas the dichotomous
data analyses yield more precision in estimating the effective concentration associated with a somewhat imprecise
response variable, the continuous data analyses offer the opposite trade off (i.e., more precision in the response
variable but less in the exposure estimate). Nevertheless, the continuous data analyses appear to merit consideration
as well as the analyses based on dichotomous data. By the Bayesian analyses of continuous data, Mn RfC estimates of
approximately 0.1 to 0.2 &mu;g/m3 are obtained.

Very limited data have been available by which to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate potential Mn personal exposure levels likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the use of MMT as an additive in unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline. For example, after the completion of ORD's 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure assessment for Mn (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990), Ethyl Corporation provided EPA a brief report of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal monitoring study as part of Ethyl Corporation's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resubmittal of a waiver application for MMT. The study focused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on 6 taxi drivers and 17 office workers in Toronto, ON, where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable MMT concentration in gasoline is 1/16 (0.062) g Mn/gal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(In the Toronto study, the actual concentration was reported as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1/26 (0.039) g Mn/gal, which is only slightly greater than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1/32 (0.031) g Mn/gal concentration proposed for the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. As confirmed by Kirshenblatt (1993), MMT concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Canadian gasoline average well below the allowable limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there.) In comments on Ethyl's resubmittal, ORD considered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toronto data in conjunction with results from independent field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies of personal exposures to carbon monoxide to develop a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised Mn exposure assessment (Preuss, 1991). A key element of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1991 ORD assessment was the assumption that taxi drivers (six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of whom were monitored in Toronto within a 2-week period) were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of a high-exposure cluster reflecting the upper 4% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population in a model based on the carbon monoxide field studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The result of the 1991 assessment was an estimate that 4% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general public might be exposed to Mn at approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.09 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, although this estimate had an undetermined amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty due to the inadequacies of the available data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Additional Canadian Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the 1991 ORD assessment, additional personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure studies have been completed in Montreal and Toronto 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(described in Appendix B, ``Reevaluation of Inhalation Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risks Associated with Methyl cyclopentadienyl Manganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tricarbonyl (MMT) in Gasoline'' as referenced in the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section below, hereafter referred to as Appendix B.) As shown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure B&hyph;10 of Appendix B, the average concentrations reported in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Canadian studies vary by as much as an order of magnitude for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small groups (5 to 19 persons each) of garage mechanics, taxi 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drivers, and office workers. The highest average Mn personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure level was 0.25 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 for Montreal garage mechanics while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at work; the other averages ranged from 0.002 to 0.035 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various particle size fractions. Although it is impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extrapolate the results of these studies to the distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn exposure levels for the general population, it does appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there is a general relationship between personal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of Mn and proximity to vehicular emissions of combusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT. Thus, populations living near high traffic-volume areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as inner cities and expressways would probably tend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience higher Mn exposure levels in relation to MMT usage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the limitations of the Canadian studies with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respect to development of a quantitative exposure assessment are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed in detail in Appendix B and may be summarized briefly as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
follows. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The studies did not have adequate sample sizes and did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample according to a probabilistic statistical design that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would help ensure the representativeness of the sampled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The sampling periods were relatively short, 1 to 2 weeks at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most. Meteorological and other factors that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to influence ambient measurements over relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short periods of time were not characterized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because the studies did not use ambient monitors collocated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with reference monitors (such as the dichotomous samplers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by Canadian agencies), it is difficult to relate data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the studies to larger databases from the government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring networks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Because the studies did not use identical monitors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure personal exposure levels and outdoor ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, it is difficult to distinguish between personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures and ambient levels or to relate one to the other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Quality assurance and certain other important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methodological details are not fully provided in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available reports.

Because of the substantial limitations of the above

exposure studies, no quantitative assessment of personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures to Mn in a Canadian population is possible at present.

3. The PTEAM Study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The only published study that has used a probability-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sampling design for evaluating exposure levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn in a general population is the Particle Total Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment Methodology (PTEAM) study, which was conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside, CA, over a 7-week period in the fall of 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pellizzari et al., 1992). This study used personal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary monitors to measure Mn concentrations indoors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outdoors. The personal samplers collected PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary samplers collected PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2.5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as well as PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see glossary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of terms in Attachment B&hyph;6 to Appendix B). Of the 139,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonsmoking residents age 10 years and older in Riverside, 178 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals were selected through a stratified sampling plan to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the general population and were monitored over two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12-hour periods (daytime and nighttime). More than 2,750 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particle samples were collected. Quality assurance and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are summarized in Appendix B and are described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensively elsewhere (e.g., Pellizzari et al., 1992; Clayton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
et al., 1993; Thomas et al., 1993). The PTEAM study has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in various peer-reviewed publications and discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several scientific forums (see Attachment B&hyph;5 to Appendix B). It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represents the best available information on an actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of general population exposures to Mn. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides valuable information on potential Mn exposure associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with MMT use, because MMT was used in leaded gasoline in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California prior to and during the period of the PTEAM study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Estimated Mn Exposure Levels Associated with MMT Usage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the substantial limitations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available Canadian exposure studies make them unsuitable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating population exposure levels of Mn in relation to MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usage. In addition, ambient monitoring data typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underestimate and may be uncorrelated with personal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of automotive-source pollutants. Therefore, of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently existing published evidence pertaining to Mn exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels in relation to MMT usage, only the PTEAM Riverside study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pellizzari et al., 1992) provides a reasonable basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating potential future exposure levels in relation to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario where 100% of unleaded gasoline contains 1/32 g Mn/gal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as proposed by Ethyl Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the PTEAM study, measurements of personal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn indicated that approximately half of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population in Riverside in the 1990 study period had 24-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal exposures to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn above 0.035 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, with the highest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1% of the population having exposures above 0.223 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3 PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, given the use of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn exposure measurements in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study of Roels et al. (1992), it would be preferable to consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a population distribution of personal exposure levels of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to limitations in the available data, the exposure assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Appendix B focuses on estimated personal exposure levels for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn, not PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although the difference is probably small, PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels are an underestimate of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels. The derivation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected exposure estimates involved several steps, which may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The automotive and nonautomotive contributions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate Mn exposures in the PTEAM study were estimated using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from Lyons et al. (1993), who reported particle size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributions up to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of selected trace metals, including Mn, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at two locations near Riverside in the winter and summer of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They attributed most of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn to automotive sources. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on their findings and data from other sources, it is possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate that 69% of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2.5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fraction of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn they measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was derived from automotive sources (namely the combustion of MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in motor vehicle fuel, as then allowed in leaded gasoline in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California) and that 31% was derived from paved road dust (mostly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earth crustal material). Next, the PTEAM Mn measurements from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stationary indoor monitors (SIMs) were used to estimate personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels by adjusting the SIM PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2.5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn data to reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically higher levels of all elements measured by personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure monitors (PEMs). This adjustment was made in two ways, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either by the PEM:SIM ratio obtained for Mn or by the ratio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained for lead (Pb), another element related to automotive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel usage. These two methods of adjusting the SIM data to PEM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values resulted in two projected distributions, as will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described below. The next step in the derivation procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved adjusting the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2.5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 personal exposure estimates to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect PM in the size range from 2.5 to 4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
m (based again on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from Lyons et al., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these estimates of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn personal exposure levels due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to automotive sources, it was then possible to project from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation in Riverside around the time of the PTEAM study (when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaded-MMT gasoline constituted about 14% of the gasoline sold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and contained an average of 0.048 g Mn/gal) to a future scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that assumes 100% of the unleaded gasoline contains MMT at 1/32 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(0.031) g Mn/gal. This aspect of the derivation is described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detail in Attachment B&hyph;4 to Appendix B. In essence, a factor was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated to reflect the estimated increase in MMT usage between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990 and 1995 (i.e., the first full year in the near future). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This projection factor assumed an increase of 1% per year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline usage and no difference in the Mn emission rate (grams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn emitted per gram Mn in fuel combusted) for noncatalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles using leaded-MMT gasoline in 1990 versus catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles using unleaded-MMT gasoline in 1995.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arithmetic mean personal exposure levels yields a scaling factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be applied to the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 distribution to obtain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributions. Because of the alternative bases for adjusting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SIM PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2.5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 data for personal exposures (as noted above), two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different scaling factors were multiplied by the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution, thereby producing a higher and a lower estimate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distribution of 24-hour average PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn personal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because long-term exposures are likely to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less variance than 24-hour exposures, it is appropriate to adjust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the distributions of 24-hour average exposure levels to better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect longer periods of exposure. Of various methods that may

two projected exposure distributions, based on data from either

the PTEAM study or the smaller pilot study that preceded the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It must be emphasized that these two distributions do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent upper and lower bounds, because even higher or lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates could be produced by alternative assumptions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments of the data. Moreover, if data were available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another time of the year (e.g., spring in addition to fall), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates would not be season-specific and could possibly be much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher or much lower. Nevertheless, given the limited available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By examination of the logarithmic-probability plot of long-term personal exposure levels of Mn, it is estimated

would have personal exposure levels around 0.1

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projections refer specifically to Riverside, CA, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population of more than 139,000 persons. However, in many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant respects (e.g., meteorology and traffic volume), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside is reasonably representative of the greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metropolitan area of Los Angeles, which has a total population of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 14.5 million persons. The exposure projection estimates for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside imply the possibility that hundreds of thousands of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons in the Los Angeles area alone could be exposed to PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. To the extent that any other U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cities (e.g., in the Southwest) share some degree of resemblance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in meteorology, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and possibly other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of relevance to automotive Mn levels, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated exposure levels for Riverside could be pertinent, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least qualitatively, to other locales or portions of locales as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well. Similarities and differences in point-source contributions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Mn exposure would also figure into comparisons with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities. The presence of a major point source or sources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn in a community (which was not a factor in Riverside) would add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some increment to the level of Mn exposure experienced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons in that community. Although these Riverside estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be applied quantitatively to any other U.S. metropolitan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, the total population of the U.S. counties with VMT levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than that of Riverside (apart from the four counties Los 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Angeles comprises) is approximately 15 million persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Possibly, then, several hundreds of thousands of persons could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

g/m3 or higher if MMT were used in 100% of the unleaded gasoline in all of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. However, it must be emphasized that because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited available data, a great deal of uncertainty surrounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such estimates. The actual exposure levels could be much higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or lower.

D. Risk Characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assess the public health risk associated with the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT in gasoline in the United States, the available qualitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quantitative health effects information on Mn must be related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the available exposure information. From the standpoint of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualitative hazard identification, the available evidence amply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that inhaled Mn is toxic to the nervous system, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respiratory system, and the male reproductive system. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of Mn by different routes of exposure has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by numerous medical reports and epidemiological and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental studies. However, available data do not allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative estimation of the relative toxicological potency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different Mn compounds or permit quantitative route-to-route 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extrapolations for predicting the effects of Mn

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The focus of the above health assessment discussion has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the RfC and the types of risks associated with chronic Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures because, for the most part, acute effect levels appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be considerably higher than the highest projected exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. However, the issue of less-than-chronic exposures does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arise with respect to the potential for developmental toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is widely recognized that the human CNS develops over a period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of several years, prenatally and postnatally, and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerable to long-term or irreversible effects if damage occurs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during certain ``critical stages'' of development. Recent evidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from ongoing longitudinal studies of children indicates that lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pb) exposure (measured as blood Pb level) around 2 years of age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in particular is associated with reduced cognitive performance at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 to 10 years of age. Such evidence raises the concern that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to another neurotoxic metal such as Mn during part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early development might also be capable of inducing permanent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irreversible damage to the developing CNS. Moreover, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ramifications of such damage might extend to other important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions, such as reproduction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children may also be at higher risk in terms of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of biomedical and metabolic differences at a young age 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(greater uptake and retention) and/or because of the longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of their exposure over a lifetime. Over time, small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairments in neurobehavioral function may accumulate. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, the elderly, whose neurobehavioral function may already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be compromised by normal aging processes and possibly by other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease states (e.g., parkinsonism or preclinical parkinsonism), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also represent a special population of concern. The ability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the elderly or other subpopulations to compensate for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
declines in neurobehavioral function may be overwhelmed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eventually by additional, albeit possibly quite small, insults 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to Mn. If so, the effect could be manifested as a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
severe or earlier onset of declining function in senescence, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequent implications for increased societal health-care costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special subpopulations at increased risk may be defined not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only in terms of their biological susceptibility, as exemplified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above by the young and the elderly, but also by their increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of exposure. In this respect, inner city residents and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others who live near high traffic areas such as expressways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., low-income and minority communities) would possibly have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disproportionate likelihood of higher Mn exposure levels due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their closer proximity to vehicular emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nature of the neurobehavioral effects observed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational studies such as Roels et al. (1992) should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understood as effects that probably would not be treated by, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even be readily evident to, a clinical physician. Nonetheless, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are significant from a public health standpoint when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered in terms of population effects. This concept is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illustrated by the well documented findings on low-level Pb 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity in children, where changes of as little as 1 or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 points in IQ have been repeatedly demonstrated in several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent, prospective, epidemiological studies in recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. Such changes could not be reliably demonstrated either in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a clinical setting or in earlier cross-sectional epidemiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies; yet they are now well established to be ``real'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant from a public health standpoint. With regard to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reductions in neurobehavioral function observed in various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological studies of Mn-exposed workers, these studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently converge on findings of impaired motor function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., reductions in eye-hand coordination, slower hand or finger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
movements, and less control of fine movement). As recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expressed in a document prepared by the Subcommittee for Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering and Technology (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993), an adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect can include ``both unwanted effects and any alteration from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline that diminishes the ability to survive, reproduce or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adapt to the environment.'' Thus, it can be argued that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects in themselves warrant consideration as adverse health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects. They may also have ramifications for health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an even more serious nature, if a person's ability to react 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quickly and accurately to a situation (e.g., traffic conditions) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was impaired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another aspect of the findings from available occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies concerns the temporal relationship between exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect. As noted above, the geometric mean average period of Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of the workers in the Roels et al. (1992) study was only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 years, with the longest period of Mn exposure for any one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual being less than 18 years. Also, the oldest worker in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Roels et al. (1992) study was less than 50 years old. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively limited period of exposure along with the absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
older subjects in the Roels study raises the question of whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient time had elapsed for the full expression of the toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of Mn. Some reports in the literature indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn toxicity may not be clinically evident until some years after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure occurred or terminated (e.g., Cotzias et al., 1968; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rodier, 1955), and other reports point to a greater sensitivity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of elderly persons, compared to middle-aged or young adults, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acute as well as chronic Mn toxicity (e.g., Kawamura et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1941). An uncertainty factor for extrapolation from a subchronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to chronic exposure was included in deriving the RfC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates shown in Figure 1. However, a ``half-factor'' of 3 was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for this area of uncertainty. If the average period of Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (geometric mean: 4 years) in the Roels et al. (1992) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study is compared to an assumed lifetime of 70 years, one could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argue that a factor of 70/4=17.5, or at least 10, would be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more appropriate adjustment for subchronic to chronic exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the limited available data, this area of uncertainty is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to express in a quantitative manner, but in general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice, EPA has used an uncertainty factor of 3 for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals with comparable databases. Nevertheless, this area of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern suggests that the Mn RfC estimates derived here with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty factor of 3 for subchronic to chronic exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably do not tend to err in the direction of being too 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another qualitative concern that should be recognized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering the potential health effects of Mn is the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of certain types of effects that are suggested by clinical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other evidence but are difficult to measure quantitatively or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate with currently available methods. Specifically, much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the clinical literature on manganism refers to a psychiatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component of the illness, which often involves striking emotional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or mood changes that tend to appear before changes in motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function are evident. Such effects are inherently difficult to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure in a quantitative manner. However, the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such effects at lower levels of exposure than those at which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor control is affected should not be discounted out of hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some reports in the literature (e.g., Gottschalk et al., 1991) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggest that aggressive behavior may be associated with Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (as reflected in the concentration of Mn in hair of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prison inmates). Such reports require substantiation by further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies, and the validity and relevance of hair Mn levels to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental Mn exposure remains to be established, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion that an association might exist between hair Mn and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior cannot be totally dismissed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Quantitative analyses of neurobehavioral data obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an occupational cohort provide a range of possible RfC estimates

in addition to the current, verified Mn RfC value of 0.05 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In ORD's judgment, the leading candidates for a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative RfC estimate are approximately 0.09 to 0.2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on currently available information. By definition, RfC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses do not yield a precise concentration that defines a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demarcation between safety and hazard. Rather, interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Mn RfC estimate is best made in relation to an assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population exposures to Mn, with the understanding that the RfC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a protective level, not a predictive value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exposure assessment, based largely on data from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PTEAM study, provides some reasonable but necessarily uncertain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates of personal exposure levels of Mn that might result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the use of MMT in gasoline. These estimates indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if MMT (at 1/32 g Mn/gal) were used in all unleaded gasoline in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside, CA (or the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area),

population of 14.5 million persons, even an estimate of 5% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population implies over 700,000 persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainties are inherent in any risk assessment. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, on the health assessment side, the numerical uncertainty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors used in the RfC analyses presented here have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicitly described and explained in and summarized above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors are intended to provide a reasonable degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health conservatism reflecting areas of biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge as well as areas of information deficit. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an RfC estimate by definition reflects uncertainty spanning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps an order of magnitude, and thus there is no significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between the verified RfC of 0.05 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. Other qualitative uncertainties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also discussed above. On the exposure assessment side, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary uncertainties are related to projections from the PTEAM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, rather than the PTEAM data per se. Inferences about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative contributions of crustal and automotive sources to PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mn were drawn from studies conducted in geographical and temporal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proximity to the PTEAM study, but both the data from these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies and the inferences based on them introduce uncertainties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attempts to adjust the PTEAM data in various ways, including any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extrapolation from the 24-hour average distribution obtained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fall of 1990 to a long-term average for other seasons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduce progressively greater uncertainties at each step. Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjustments have not even been attempted. For example, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weighting of the daytime and nighttime PTEAM exposure data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect a higher average ventilation rate during daytime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities and a lower ventilation rate during nighttime 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities (e.g., sleeping) would have resulted in higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal exposure estimates. Thus, given other approaches or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions, different projection estimates are possible. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must therefore be emphasized that the two projections of Mn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels in Figure 2 should not be interpreted as upper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and lower bound estimates, for even the higher projection could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibly underestimate, or the lower projection overestimate, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mn exposure levels associated with MMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the relevance of the PTEAM Riverside personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure estimates to other communities, the PTEAM study was, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strictly speaking, only designed to statistically represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside, CA. In that respect, the design and conduct of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PTEAM study provide a high degree of confidence that it does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately represent 24-hour average Mn exposure concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the Riverside population in the fall of 1990. In ORD's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment, the PTEAM study provides a reasonable representation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Los Angeles Basin as well, given the commonalities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geography, vehicle usage, and meteorology. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevance of the Riverside data to other U.S. communities depends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon their similarities or differences in the most relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics or dimensions. For example, to the extent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several other major U.S. metropolitan areas (or subcommunities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these areas) also have a high level of vehicle usage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside projections may have greater relevance. To the extent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that these same areas do not share the meteorological conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that contribute to the Mn exposure levels measured in Riverside, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Riverside projections have lesser relevance. It is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to consider other sources of Mn exposure apart from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automotive and crustal sources. Although Riverside had no major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point sources of Mn contributing to the personal exposure levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in the PTEAM study, other communities may have such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, and thus the personal exposure levels of Mn from all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources might be higher in other communities than in Riverside.

The exposure estimates shown in Figure 3 are in the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or exceed some candidate RfC estimates as well as the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RfC. Exceeding the RfC does not necessarily indicate that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health risk will occur. At present, it is impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state whether projected exposures above the RfC would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adverse health effect for either an individual or the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. At a sufficiently high level of exposure, adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects would be expected to occur, first in any sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpopulations, then with greater prevalence in the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population and extending to other types of effects (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reproductive and/or respiratory as well as neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects in the case of Mn). However, the relationship between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such ``sufficiently high'' levels and the population exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels estimated by the projection methods employed here is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unknown. Expressed differently, given the gap between observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or modeled effect levels and the RfC values obtained by applying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty factors of orders of magnitude, it is impossible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state whether projected population exposures would lie above or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below a presumed threshold level on the actual concentration-response curve for Mn neurotoxicity. This gap between
projected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels and the lowest concentrations obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeling the concentration-response relationship (at least, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quantal linear model) makes it impossible to make any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assertion regarding the likelihood of a health risk at projected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels. However, this conclusion should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted to imply that, therefore, no health risk is expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to exist at exposure levels exceeding the RfC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The focus of most of Ethyl's comments regarding the effects on public health and welfare resulting from the use of MMT
in unleaded gasoline deal with issues related to EPA's risk assessment and specifically to the calculation of an RfC
for manganese by the utilization of various analytical methods, to the uncertainty factors used by the Agency in determining
the RfC for manganese, and to the exposure assessment for manganese. A summary discussion of the significant issues
related to these comments follows.

For a complete description of the EPA response to Ethyl's comments, the reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26,
(Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;15) ``ORD's Response to Public Comments on the Reference Concentration
for Manganese and on the Draft ORD Risk Assessment of MMT.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, Ethyl states that ``ORD openly concedes that after four years of efforts it is unable to conclude that a
public health risk would exist for even the most highly exposed segment of the population.'' The Agency indicated
to Ethyl in 1991 the research it could conduct to provide for a more quantitative assessment of the MMT issue. Thus,
assessment of the risks or benefits of MMT could be, or perhaps could already have been, improved if more empirical
information were provided by Ethyl to the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl commented on ORD's April 28, 1994 draft MMT Risk Assessment that, depending on the methodology used for the derivation
of the RfC for manganese, the level of manganese concentrations ``without appreciable risk'' lies somewhere within
the range of 0.1 to 3.0 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that all of ORD's RfC calculations fall within this range. Contrary to Ethyl's statement, the inclusion of Ethyl's
proposed RfC estimate of 3.0 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in tables and figures summarizing the RfC estimates obtained by different methods was merely an attempt by the Agency
to illustrate all of the RfC estimates. The Agency did not imply or state a conclusion that ``The majority of ORD's RfC
calculations fall in the 0.1&hyph;3.0 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 range.'' ORD focused on a leading candidate RfC estimate of approximately 0.1 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, while explicitly noting that the current official RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is not meaningfully different from a possible alternative RfC estimate of 0.1 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To more effectively avoid possible ambiguity that is reflected in Ethyl's comment, Figure 1 of the final MMT Risk Assessment
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1994b) shows all of the RfC estimates contained in Table A&hyph;39 of Appendix
A. Ethyl's preferred RfC estimate of 3 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is now omitted from Figure 1 because it is not a value obtained by any of ORD's analyses. Moreover, it is ORD's view that
the best estimate of an alternative RfC estimate for Mn, based on the analyses and data considered to date, probably
lies in the range of 0.09 to 0.2 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This judgment is based on the strengths and weaknesses of the various analytic approaches considered by ORD in the
April 28 draft assessment.

greater scientific strengths than the other analyses considered by ORD or by Ethyl.

Ethyl has stated that EPA has failed to address issues regarding both the statistical treatment of the data underlying
the RfC and EPA's decision to employ a 1000-fold factor of uncertainty in calculating the RfC. EPA disagrees. Appendix
A of the ORD Risk Assessment addresses each of these issues. The extensive analyses the Agency has conducted represent
a concerted effort to respond to the statistical issues raised by Ethyl. The fact that EPA does not adopt Ethyl's advocated
position is not a failure to address the issues. In fact, no scientific consensus or policy exists on many of these issues,
such as the selection of a specific mathematical dose-response model, the selection of an effect level, how to address
continuous data, and the appropriate magnitude of severity regarding production of uncertainty factors for the
various effect levels. As is specifically described in the ``Response to Comments'' document, ORD utilized scientific
judgment in determining the appropriateness of certain models and the inclusion of specific uncertainty factors.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl also expressed concerns that EPA had not adequately addressed alternative analyses for estimating an RfC by
utilizing different groupings of subjects in the Roels analysis. ICF Kaiser, a consultant for Ethyl, commented that
``ORD ignores alternative analyses which most closely resemble the conventional method for calculating RfCs.''
The alternative approach Ethyl employed to group the data from the study by Roels et al. (1992) has no evident rationale
other than providing a statistically nonsignificant effect level. The groupings employed by Roels et al. (1992)
and used by ORD appear to have been selected because they provided approximately equal numbers of subjects per group.
The groupings selected by Ethyl result in both smaller and more disparate numbers of subjects per group, with a consequent
reduction in statistical power to detect a significant difference between a Mn-exposed group and controls. Further,
as explained in the Response to Comments Document previously cited, ORD does not view the use of the upper boundary
of the concentration associated with a group as a scientifically appropriate or representative metric to describe
the exposure of the entire group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl also took issue with the Agency for focusing on analyses using the average concentration of respirable dust
(ACRD). The decision to focus on ACRD was not arbitrary or designed to yield lower RfC estimates but, as explained in
Appendix A of the ORD Risk Assessment, was based on both an explicit consideration of the advantages ACRD offered for
fitting dose-response models and its ability to reflect average past exposure, thereby obviating some of the apparent
disadvantages of the two exposure measures reported by Roels et al. (1992), LIRD and CRD. Although the Agency views
ACRD as the best choice of these three available exposure measures for the analytical approaches employed in the ORD
risk assessment, Figure 1 (See Section VI&hyph;B, above.) illustrates all of the RfC estimates presented for all
three exposure measures and all analytical approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl recommends that certain analyses should be omitted from consideration on the ORD risk assessment. To some extent,
the Agency believes the difference between Ethyl's and EPA's positions is related to differing interpretations
of what is reasonable versus unreasonable, biologically plausible versus implausible, or valid versus invalid.
As addressed before, the Agency's basic approach in the ORD risk assessment was to present all of the results of its
analyses and then identify a subset of the total that have a scientifically stronger basis for being considered preferentially.

Ethyl offers several arguments directed at reducing the overall uncertainty and specifically the composite uncertainty
factor (UF) of 10 for database limitations applied in deriving estimates of an RfC for manganese. Ethyl's first argument
concerns the basic ``biological plausibility'' of the RfC, suggesting that inhaled manganese cannot be as toxic
(compared to ingested manganese) as the roughly 100-fold difference in RfC and RfD estimates would indicate.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 The Agency believes that a fundamental problem with Ethyl's comparison is that it is limited to what Ethyl estimates
is the ``systemic dose.'' The key issue is not systemic dose but delivered dose, i.e., the amount of manganese that
actually reaches and enters a critical target organ such as the brain. Furthermore, the Agency believes that, depending
on the form of manganese inhaled, and its ability to enter the brain, it is quite possible that a significant fraction
of even small amounts of inhaled manganese would be able to reach target sites in the central nervous system. Thus,
the apparently greater toxicity of inhaled versus ingested manganese may reflect important pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic differences of manganese that enters the body by different routes of exposure. Ethyl's analysis
of systemic dose does not adequately address this issue.

See Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26. The Reference Dose or RfD is analogous to the RfC but for ingestion as opposed to
inhalation. Document II&hyph;A&hyph;13 (in the docket), Table 1, compares the ``systemic dose'' of manganese for
the Recommended Daily Intake (now termed ``Recommended Daily Allowance'' by FDA) of ingested manganese, the RfC
for inhaled manganese, and the RfD for manganese in drinking water. This tabular comparison does not address several
issues that the Agency has identified as factors in its assessment on inhaled manganese toxicity.

In fact, as is indicated in ``ORD's Response to Comments on MMT'' document, many studies indicate that inhalation
exposure does result in a greater delivered dose. This evidence includes, for example, a report by Coulston and Griffin
(1977), who exposed monkeys to the whole combustion products of MMT (Mn

) for 23 hr/day for up to 66 weeks. According to the authors, monkeys breathed 0.86 L/min, or 119 L in a 23-hr exposure
day. AT 100 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, approximately 120 &mu;g Mn would be inhaled daily, which would equate to a systemic dose of about 24 &mu;g/day (assuming
20% deposition and 100% absorption). In addition, both control and inhalation-exposed monkeys ingested about 4&hyph;5
mg Mn/day in their diet, which would equate to a systemic dose of approximately 135 &mu;g/day (assuming 3% absorption).
Even though these calculations indicate that the diet accounted for about six times more Mn entering the body of the
exposed animals, the relatively small inhalation fraction doubled the delivered dose of Mn in the brains of the inhalation-exposed
monkeys. Furthermore, the authors found blood levels of Mn to be equivalent in the exposed and control monkeys, despite
the higher brain levels in the inhalation-exposed animals. Thus, extrapolations based on estimated systemtic dose
by ingestion underpredict doses delivered to the brain by inhalation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The more specific critique Ethyl offers regarding the composite UF of 10 for database limitations deals with three
areas of inadequate information represented by the composite factor: chronic exposure effects, reproductive/developmental
effects, and differences in toxicity of different forms of manganese. In deriving RfCs for other chemicals, any one
of these three areas of uncertainty has, in one case or another, warranted a full UF of 10.

The decision whether to utilize the full uncertainty factor of 10 is based on a judgement by the RfC workgroup on a case-by-case
basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency believes that given the possible accumulation of manganese, the effects of chronic exposure to inhaled
manganese are of concern. The maximum average exposure duration of the available occupational studies cited by both
ORD and Ethyl is 16.7 years (Mergler et al. 1994),
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 which does not constitute chronic exposure. Ethyl's comments ignore the point that the RfC is in fact aimed at extrapolation
to 70 exposure years. Reproductive and developmental toxicity are widely recognized as significant public health
concerns and therefore warrant specific consideration as uncertainties in RfC derivation. The available animal
studies on reproductive and developmental effects almost exclusively involved oral dosing of manganese and are
inadequate for inhalation RfC purposes. Studies of such effects in humans are limited for males and nonexistent for
females.

The potential difference in toxicity potency of Mn3O4 in comparison to MnO2 or other compounds of manganese is a significant
uncertainty because no existing study has directly compared the toxicities of these compounds by inhalation exposure.
Ethyl's comparison of studies involving not only different routes of exposure but significant differences in methods,
subjects/subject populations, and other key features does not constitute an adequate quantitative assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the three areas of uncertainty reflected in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composite UF of 10 used in deriving the manganese RfC estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are appropriate because they are not adequately addressed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl stated that ORD has overlooked evidence from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadian exposure studies that indicate personal exposure levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manganese are likely to be lower than indicated by the PTEAM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Riverside Study. The Agency considers Ethyl's exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment based on Canadian data to be deficient in several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respects. Given the fundamental differences in the sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for the Canadian and Riverside studies, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other differences in the design and conduct of the studies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question, the Agency continues to judge the PTEAM Riverside data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be far more useful to exposure assessment purposes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadian data. The ``consistency'' in the Canadian data that Ethyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emphasizes is a subjective matter that can be considered from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than one perspective.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ethyl also disagrees with certain assumptions and features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ORD's draft exposure assessment. In particular, Ethyl claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ORD's draft ``PTEAM Riverside exposure model'' overestimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese exposure levels for selected Canadian cities by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of approximately three when used with a factor for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected increases in MMT usage. Ethyl's application of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Riverside model'' is incorrect for several reasons, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's use of ambient monitoring data to estimate personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels (ORD used stationary indoor monitoring data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected as part of a personal exposure study). The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notes that qualitative differences in meteorology and the degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of automobile usage provide a more likely basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences between Riverside and the Canadian cities cited by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl also states that the manganese emission rate from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catalyst vehicles should be a factor of three lower than that for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncatalyzed vehicles, which would lower ORD's projected exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates by almost the same factor. After reevaluating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited data on manganese emissions from noncatalyst and catalyst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles, ORD has concluded that no specific emission rate can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified by the available data and that, consequently, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption of equivalent emission rates for both types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles is reasonable and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl cited data pertaining to the amount of iron and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese in soil and paved road dust (PRD) in Riverside that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate the percentage of automotive contribution to personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 manganese should be lower than the value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ORD used. ORD agrees that the iron:manganese data for Riverside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRD provide a more geographically specific basis for estimating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automotive contributions, and therefore the projection estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of personal exposure levels of manganese would be slightly lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of this adjustment.
<FOOTCITE>69</FOOTCITE>

Ethyl states that Riverside is not representative of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. cities, and ORD does not disagree. Nevertheless, ORD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes Riverside is reasonably representative of the greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Los Angeles metropolitan area. Consequently, the PTEAM Riverside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure assessment can be considered representative for at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14.5 million people (the population of the greater Los Angeles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area). To the extent that other U.S. cities share some degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resemblance in meteorology, vehicles miles traveled, and possibly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other characteristics of relevance to automotive manganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, the estimated exposure levels for Riverside may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent to other locales and portions of locales as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, ORD can only point to qualitative similarities and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to make any quantitative statement on the degree of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevance of the Riverside data to other U.S. cities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its May 27 submission,
<FOOTCITE>70</FOOTCITE>
 Ethyl has noted that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of 24-hour average exposure levels is likely to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher exposures at the upper portion of the distribution than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would a longer term average for the same population. ORD agrees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this is likely, but the lack of adequate exposure data make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it impossible to determine what the actual distribution would be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Ethyl attempts to correct the distribution of 24-hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average data to represent a longer term average, ORD notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unstated assumptions and possible errors in Ethyl's calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and prefers alternative approaches to estimating such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correction to the distribution.

Finally, Ethyl raises issues from comparing ORD's assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MMT with ORD's assessment of methyl tertiary butyl ether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MTBE). Ethyl reduces the official EPA RfC for MTBE by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate uncertainty factors, compares the result to both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate and inappropriate exposure values for MTBE, finds an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlap of these health and exposure assessments for MTBE, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that, by comparison, MMT was treated too conservatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or erroneously. Basically, because of substantial differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the databases and characteristics of MTBE (a volatile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic compound that remains in the body for a matter of hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to days) and Mn (a metal that accumulates in the body), Ethyl's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct comparisons are not valid.

VII. Fuels and Fuel Additives Registration and Research Needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To more accurately define an RfC for manganese and to more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately predict the distribution of expected manganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures associated with MMT use, additional research will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be completed. Such research would ultimately lead to a risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment which could better define the risk associated with MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. Furthermore, regulations under sections 211(a), (b), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) of the Act, set forth a procedure under which required health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and exposure data must be submitted prior to any new use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or additive. Given the basis for today's decision and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the testing requirements imposed by these regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency expects that the testing required to resolve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns upon which today's decision is based will also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under these regulations. The following section explains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these newly promulgated requirements and how they would apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of MMT in unleaded gasoline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, certain fuels and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives must be registered with EPA as a precondition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction into commerce. Section 211(a) of the Act authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to designate any fuel or fuel additive for registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon designation, fuels or additives may not be introduced into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce unless they have been registered by EPA in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 211(b). In 1975, EPA issued regulations (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 79) implementing basic registration requirements, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stipulated by section 211(b)(1), that required applicants to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit certain information, such as commercial identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, range of concentration, purpose-in-use, and chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition, in order to register a fuel or fuel additive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1970 Clean Air Act also gave EPA discretionary authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish additional registration requirements under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(b)(2). This section authorized EPA to require fuel and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive manufacturers ``to conduct tests to determine potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health effects of such fuel(s) or additive(s) (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not limited to, carcinogenic, teratogenic, or mutagenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects),'' and to further furnish other ``reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary'' information to identify fuel and fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions and determine their effects on vehicular emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control performance and on public health and welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA did not exercise its discretionary authority to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of fuels and fuel additives under section 211(b)(2) when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general registration regulations were first adopted in 1975. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977 (Public Law 95&hyph;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95, August 7, 1977), Congress added section 211(e), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required EPA to take certain actions to implement section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(b)(2). A final rule was signed by the Administrator of EPA on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 27, 1994 and was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27, 1994 (59 FR 33042). The final rule, ``Fuels and Fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additives Registration Regulations'', implemented additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration requirements under sections 211(b)(2) and 211(e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Clean Air Act. The rule requires manufacturers to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA with information to assist EPA in identifying and evaluating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential adverse health effects of motor vehicle fuel and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive emissions, and to support and guide related regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recently promulgated health effects testing requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate a three-tiered health effects evaluation structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Tier 1, fuel and fuel additive manufacturers are required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform a literature search on the health and welfare effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fuel and fuel additive emissions, characterize the emissions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and provide exposure information. Tier 2 includes short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological testing to screen for specific health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole emissions of fuels or fuel/additive mixtures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where appropriate, EPA has retained authority to modify or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
augment the standard Tier 2 test requirements. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``alternative Tier 2'' procedures set forth in &sect;79.58(c), EPA may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitute alternative tests for standard Tier 2 tests or impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional testing requirements. Alternative Tier 2 procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be utilized to modify standard Tier 2 requirements, but may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be utilized to entirely delete testing for any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard endpoints. The alternative Tier 2 provision affords the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency flexibility when available information indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another testing regimen is preferable to the standard set of Tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2 tests. Instances where Alternative Tier 2 requirements may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate include scenarios where previously available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information may cause EPA to be concerned about potential health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects related to an endpoint not specifically addressed in Tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2, or when otherwise available information identifies a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially significant public health risk related to a Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoint such that more definitive testing will be required for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this endpoint than is ordinarily required. In both of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenarios, alternative Tier 2 testing can facilitate earlier and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially more efficient acquisition of the required data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receipt and review of a manufacturer's Tier 1 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 submittals, EPA determines, on a case-by-case basis, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional testing is needed under Tier 3 to evaluate the risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a particular fuel or fuel additive (or group of fuels or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives) on human health or welfare. Tier 3 testing could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include any emission analysis, health effects, welfare effects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or exposure testing or analysis deemed necessary by EPA for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has considerable discretion to formulate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose appropriate testing requirements under either alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 or Tier 3 procedures. In practice, EPA will be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to utilize alternative Tier 2 procedures in instances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where additional data needs are apparent even prior to completion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and submission of the standard Tier 2 tests, and prompt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation of appropriate alternative testing requirements will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in a more efficient use of industry and governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources. Tier 3 procedures will be preferred in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances where standard Tier 2 tests are necessary to assist EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in identification of potential hazards and/or in design or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selection of appropriate follow-up studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For fuels and fuel additives registered as of the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of the final rule, registrants must submit Tier 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Tier 2 test data within six years of that date. On the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand, manufacturers seeking to register new fuel and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive products after the date of promulgation must satisfy all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing requirements before registration will be granted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, the new rule clarifies what constitutes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``new'' fuel or fuel additive, distinguishing between two types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unregistered products which a manufacturer might seek to register 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the promulgation of the final rule: (1) fuel and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive products similar in composition and usage to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already allowed wide commercial distribution (e.g., registered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for general use by other manufacturers), and (2) fuel and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive products which differ significantly in composition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or usage from such current products. To effectuate this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinction, EPA's final rule, promulgated under sections 211(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (e), makes use of grouping system concepts and definitions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, a fuel additive product not registered by its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer
<FOOTCITE>73</FOOTCITE>
 for a specific type of fuel as of the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of this rule is designated as ``registrable'' if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific fuel is in the same fuel/additive group as one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently registered fuels or bulk additives.
<FOOTCITE>74</FOOTCITE>
 The grouping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system establishes various fuel/additive groups within each fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family.
<FOOTCITE>75</FOOTCITE>
 Conversely, a fuel additive product not registered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by its manufacturer for a specific type of fuel as of the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation is designated as ``new'' if the fuel/additive mixture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from use of the additive in the specific fuel cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouped with one or more currently registered fuels or bulk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives. In these definitions, the term ``currently registered'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to the date on which the prospective applicant seeks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration for the fuel or fuel additive in question.

For purposes of these definitions, registration is product-specific. Thus, if a particular fuel or fuel additive
product has not been registered by its manufacturer, then that manufacturer does not have the right to introduce,
market, and/or sell this product, even if a compositionally similar or identical product has been registered by another
manufacturer.

A ``bulk additive,'' sometimes called a ``general use'' additive was defined as a product added to fuel at the refinery
as part of the original blending stream or after the fuel is transported from the refinery, but before the fuel is purchased
for introduction into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle. In contrast, an ``aftermarket additive,'' sometimes called
a consumer additive, is an additive product marketed for introduction directly into the fuel system of a motor vehicle.

``Fuel Family'' refers to the primary categorization of fuels and fuel additives within the proposed grouping system.
A fuel family was defined as a set of F/FAs which share basic chemical and physical formulation characteristics and
can be used in the same engine or vehicle. Six such fuel families were proposed (unleaded gasoline, leaded gasoline,
diesel, methanol, ethanol, methane, and propane). EPA did not include a leaded gasoline family in the final rule because
Clean Air Act section 211(n) prohibits on-road use of leaded fuel after December 31, 1995. In the definition of ``registrable,''
the restriction ``in the same fuel family'' means that the similarity of an applicant F/FA to a bulk additive currently
registered for use in another fuel family would not suffice to make the applicant F/FA registrable. This restriction
is consistent with the general principles of the grouping system, which permits grouping of F/FAs only within defined
fuel families.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to these definitions, an unregistered fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive which meets the criteria for grouping only with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently registered aftermarket additive (and not also with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently registered fuel and/or bulk additive) is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registrable. This does not preclude an unregistered aftermarket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive from being registrable (since aftermarket additives can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group with fuels and bulk additives), nor does it affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration status of currently registered aftermarket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, an unregistered detergent additive (either bulk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or aftermarket) intended for use in unleaded gasoline and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conforming to the ``substantially similar'' criteria for unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline (56 FR 5352) would be registrable, since it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to group with currently registered baseline unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline fuels and bulk additives.
<FOOTCITE>76</FOOTCITE>
 On the other hand, MMT is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered ``new'' rather than ``registrable'' for unleaded gasoline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because there are no currently registered manganese-containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels or bulk additives in the unleaded gasoline family with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a mixture of MMT and unleaded gasoline could be grouped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is true even though products containing MMT are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered for bulk use in leaded gasoline and as aftermarket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives grandfathered prior to the ban on such aftermarket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives.

Until the 1990 CAA Amendments went into effect, the statutory language of section 211(f) was interpreted as applying
only to unleaded gasoline fuels and related bulk additives. Thus, prior to November 15, 1990 (the effective date of
the CAA Amendments), aftermarket additives intended for use in unleaded gasoline and containing elements other
than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur were allowed to be registered. Under the 1990 CAA Amendments,
all types of motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives were placed under 211(f) jurisdiction. All aftermarket additives
that were not ``substantially similar'' and were introduced on or after November 15, 1990, were banned. However,
this ban does not apply to products first introduced into commerce prior to November 15, 1990 (CAA section 211(f)(1)(B)).
Thus, ``non-sub-sim'' gasoline aftermarket additives which had been registered prior to that date were allowed
to retain their registrations. These are so-called ``grandfathered'' aftermarket additives.

The recently finalized rule requires that manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new fuel and fuel additive products (i.e., fuel and fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products not registered by their specific manufacturers as of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of promulgation and not fitting the registrable criteria) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit all testing requirements prior to registration, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any alternative Tier 2 tests or Tier 3 tests prescribed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency. As discussed above, under the fuel and fuel additive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing rule, MMT is designated as ``new'' for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration for use in unleaded gasoline. Accordingly, any data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to register MMT for use in unleaded gasoline must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted prior to registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, Tier 1 requires manufacturers of designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels or fuel additives (or groups of manufacturers pursuant to &sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
79.56) to supply to the Administrator: (1) the identity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of certain emission products of such fuel and fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives, (2) an analysis of potential emissions exposures, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) any available information regarding the health and welfare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the whole and specified emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the General Provision of the emission characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Tier 1, it is stated in &sect;79.52(b)(1)(ii) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the emissions shall be generated three times (on three different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days) without a functional aftertreatment device and, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable, three times (on three different days) with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional aftertreatment device, and each such time shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed according to the remaining provisions in this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b). Measurement of background emissions, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;79.52(b)(1)(iii), states that it is required that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambient/dilution air be analyzed for levels of background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical species present at the time of emission sampling (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both combustion and evaporative emissions) and that background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical species profiles be reported with emissions speciation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data. Ethyl has yet to provide the Agency with data on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization of emissions resulting from the use of MMT in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unleaded gasoline which meets the requirements of Tier 1 under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these subsections. Thus, to EPA's knowledge, data has not yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been collected which would fully satisfy Tier 1 requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;79.52(b)(1) (ii) and (iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard Tier 2 testing includes certain specific types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term biological testing to screen for specific health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects endpoints, involving the exposure of laboratory animals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the whole emissions of the fuel additive (when added to a base 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel). Where appropriate, the Agency may impose an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 test in lieu of a standard Tier 2 test or prescribe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional Tier 2 testing in addition to the standard Tier 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's Office of Research and Development has prepared a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report that specifically identifies research which would allow a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more accurate evaluation of the risk involved in utilizing MMT in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unleaded gasoline.
<FOOTCITE>78</FOOTCITE>
 Some of the research described in the ORD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report is intended to address toxicologic endpoints which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also addressed by standard Tier 2 tests,
<FOOTCITE>79</FOOTCITE>
 while other research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the report is intended to address other endpoints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA presently has an adequate basis to conclude that there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concerns associated with the potential use of MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in unleaded gasoline, and anticipates that research addressing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the areas identified in the ORD report will be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to support registration of MMT for use in unleaded gasoline. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not necessary, and would be inefficient, to wait for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion and submission of all of the standard Tier 2 tests in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to identify the requisite test data, and use of alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 procedures is therefore appropriate.

For example, it is clear that the standard Tier 2 neurotoxicity will not address adequately the potential neurotoxicity
of inhaled manganese to humans. Although the precise mechanisms of such neurotoxicity are not fully understood,
it has been shown that manganese toxicity may be associated with degeneration of certain tissues in the brain. These
brain tissues include the substantia nigra which is found only in primates and not in lower mammals. Laboratory rodents
typically employed in the standard Tier 2 neurotoxcity test do not physically possess this target for manganese toxicity
in the brain.

If Ethyl or any other party seeks to register MMT for use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unleaded gasoline, it will need to submit the required test data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in addition to obtaining the required waiver. In that case, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects to identify specific alternative Tier 2 tests which must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be performed prior to registration.
<FOOTCITE>80</FOOTCITE>
 In the case of endpoints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by the ORD report, that report will serve as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
starting point for EPA in identifying appropriate alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tier 2 tests. In each instance where EPA does not adopt any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative Tier 2 requirement for an endpoint which is addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by standard Tier 2 tests, standard information or testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements will continue to apply. The process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of alternative Tier 2 testing requirements for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product includes specific procedures for notification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer and an opportunity for comment, and is set forth in

If there is any reason why Ethyl would prefer to complete the standard set of Tier 2 tests and submit such tests prior

Submission of any data which is required by the registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations prior to registration of MMT for use in unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline is not itself a specific legal prerequisite to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granting of a waiver under section 211(f)(4). However, in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, since the Agency is declining to grant the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested waiver based on potential health effects, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers it reasonable to require that Ethyl submit the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effects and exposure test data which will be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to registration of MMT for unleaded gasoline before it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider taking favorable action on another waiver application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the health effects testing rule indicates, EPA believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it should exercise particular caution in registering new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel or fuel additive products that are significantly different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from, or have a usage pattern which is significantly different in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope or character from, currently registered fuel or fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additive products. EPA also believes that the same cautious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach is appropriate in evaluating waiver applications under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(f)(4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ethyl has stated that certain other considerations and data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with MMT use should be taken into account by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator in utilizing the discretion authorized under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 211(f)(4). These issues include (1) decreased emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of toxic air pollutants due to decreases in aromatic use when MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is substituted as an octane enhancer; (2) decreased refinery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions due to decreased reformer severity; (3) decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon monoxide (CO) and oxides of nitrogen (NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions, (4) increased crude oil yield and associated energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
savings, and (5) decreased levels of tropospheric ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with lower levels of reactive hydrocarbon emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emission decreases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding CO emission decreases, EPA's analysis indicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that examination of all of the available test data on the CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of MMT shows a small (0.07 gpm or 2% of applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards
<FOOTCITE>81</FOOTCITE>
) decrease attributable to the additive.
<FOOTCITE>82</FOOTCITE>
 With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exceptions of two vehicle models, the CO effects in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directions were relatively small. The most significant exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this general pattern is the test data from the 1988 Ford Crown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Victoria 5L, which showed a decrease of 0.72 gpm (or 21% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard). The other unusual vehicle was also a Ford Crown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Victoria_a 1992 model with a 0.36 gpm decrease (11% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard). The small average size and somewhat erratic nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CO decreases seen in the vehicle sample lead to questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about whether this small potential benefit is likely to actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in the vehicle fleet.

This effect was calculated by integrating emissions, separately for clear and MMT fuels, over the full range of mileage

 show a more substantial and more consistent decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for this pollutant than was the case for CO. The average across 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
models was 0.08 gpm or 8% of the standard. The largest decreases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were seen in the 1992 Ford Mustang 5.0L model and the 1988 Ford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Crown Victoria 5L (each showing a 0.30 gpm decrease or 30% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard). Other models with substantial decreases were the 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford Taurus (0.22 gpm or 22% of the standard) and the 1992 Buick 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regal 3.8L (0.19 gpm or 19% of the standard). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreases of this magnitude might have on tropospheric ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations, since such effects are influenced heavily by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mix of ozone precursors and the atmospheric chemistry of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular non-attainment areas. Modeling studies performed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA have shown that NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limited areas can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly reduce regional ozone levels. However, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regional ozone decreased, some urban areas showed slight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases in ozone levels. It is not possible to quantify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of reduction in ozone associated with the introduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMT in general because many factors affect ambient ozone. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to achieve such a quantification, individual cities would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be analyzed to determine their VOC/NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ratios and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobile source contribution to those ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has therefore concluded that it is likely that in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although ORD has not independently verified Ethyl's current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis, it is nevertheless possible to evaluate their analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by taking it at face value. Significant uncertainties are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in any prediction of a net change in cancer risk. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, there are various models and assumptions underlying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated changes in carcinogen exposures. Assumptions must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made regarding the composition of gasoline at different times in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the future; projected fleet emissions must be estimated based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements from a few vehicles; the impact of MMT on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emissions must be estimated. In addition, the relationship of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in emissions is assumed to be related to population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cancer risk, whether characterized in terms of the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases in the entire U.S. population or in terms of individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit risk estimates, also has inherent uncertainties. According 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Ethyl, the predicted reduction in estimated cancer cases is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.6 to 2.0 cases per year. These represent upper bound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates, and thus the true impact is very unlikely to be higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and may in fact be less. Ethyl also predicts that the changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability of an individual contracting cancer is lowered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with MMT use from about 12 cases per 100,000 to 6 cases per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100,000. Again these estimates represent upper bounds, so the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
true risk to an individual would not be expected to be higher and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could well be lower. In any case, the individual risk level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains in the 10&hyph;5 range. Relative to the uncertainties in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer risk estimates as well as in the emission and exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of Ethyl's analysis, the magnitude of the claimed change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in risk is comparatively quite small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accuracy of these estimates also depends very much on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estimates of decreased aromatics use for individual refiners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Very significant changes are taking place in the refining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry to comply with various aspects of programs being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented pursuant to the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Programs such as the introduction of ``reformulated gasoline'' will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dramatically change the overall chemical and physical properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of gasoline. Thus, estimates of aromatics usage associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refining are even more highly speculative over the next several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years as these programs are implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any case, it is not possible to weigh these predicted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in cancer incidence or in ozone formation against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns which have been explained above in relation to increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese emissions. Therefore, the Agency disagrees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's claim that it can be shown scientifically that a net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health benefit results from the use of MMT in unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline. While the Agency agrees that such risk-benefit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparisons can be important, the present data are inadequate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this purpose. With regard to the potential risks associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhalation exposure to manganese, the Agency's Risk Assessment as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above indicates that there are insufficient data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclude quantitatively whether the increased use of MMT will (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not) increase public health risk. With regard to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential reductions in cancer incidence and tropospheric ozone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels associated with MMT use claimed by Ethyl, the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis indicates that, while reductions are possible, the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are too sparse to provide reasonable quantitative estimates of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the magnitude of such reductions. The estimated cancer reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not truly discernable as a quantifiable benefit. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because relative to the uncertainties in the cancer risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates as well as in the emission and exposure aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's analysis, the estimated magnitude of change in risk is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quite small, even when based on the ``upper bound'' cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates. For ozone, it is not possible in general to quantify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the degree of reduction associated with the introduction of MMT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because many factors, including local volatile organic compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(VOC)/NO

 ratios affect ambient ozone levels. To achieve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantification, all appropriate individual cities would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be analyzed.

IX. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As previously discussed, the Agency interprets section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
211(f)(4) of the Act as establishing a two-stage process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating waiver applications. The first stage requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA determine whether an applicant has met its burden of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating that a fuel does not cause or contribute to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure to meet regulated emission standards. Unless EPA finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the waiver applicant has met this burden, a waiver may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be granted. The second stage of the process reflects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretionary nature of the waiver authority provided to the EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator by the statute. In this second stage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may consider other factors in determining whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granting a waiver is in the public interest and consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the objectives of the Clean Air Act. In this stage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator has broad discretion in selecting the issues to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined and in balancing the potential positive and negative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of a waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the pending waiver application, as remanded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to EPA by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and resubmitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl, I determined on November 30, 1993 that use of Ethyl's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product HiTEC 3000 in unleaded gasoline at the specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration will not cause or contribute to a failure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve compliance with vehicle emission standards. The data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis upon which this determination was based are described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section IV above. The data submitted by Ethyl in connection with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this waiver application satisfy all of the quantitative criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for determining whether an additive will ``cause or contribute'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a failure to meet emission standards previously utilized by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, EPA has serious reservations concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present suitability of these criteria. In light of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intractability of the nation's air pollution problems, EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering adoption of new criteria which would be utilized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing future waiver applications. However, for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl's present application, EPA concluded that it would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to make the required determination concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emission effects by utilizing a new methodology or new criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning which Ethyl was not afforded any prior notice. My 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision that Ethyl has met the requisite statutory burden for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the present waiver application is also based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's assessment of the newest data provided by Ethyl on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newer-technology vehicles which do not, when evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately, indicate any statistically significant increase in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated vehicle emissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency remains concerned about the possible effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuels containing MMT on the functioning of onboard diagnostics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(OBD) equipment. At the time that EPA completed the assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of emissions issues underlying my finding concerning emissions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1993, the evidence to support the assertions by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automakers that MMT would prevent the oxygen sensors in OBD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems from operating properly was quite limited and these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assertions had not at that time been tested in any actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicles utilizing OBD systems. I expressed concern about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of MMT on OBD systems at that time, and indicated that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA ultimately concluded that MMT could prevent proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning of OBD systems, the Agency would consider appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action under Clean Air Act section 211(c). Since that time, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford Motor Company has submitted further research involving use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fuel containing MMT in an actual vehicle equipped with an OBD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, which Ford contends demonstrates that manganese oxides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from MMT use prevent the oxygen sensors in its OBD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems from functioning properly. EPA intends to fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate the significance of these findings. If further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation supports the concerns expressed by Ford and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automakers, EPA intends to initiate an appropriate rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 211(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since I determined that Ethyl had met its burden regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``cause or contribute'' finding required by the statute, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency has been reviewing other issues bearing on the exercise of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
my discretionary authority to grant or deny Ethyl the requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waiver for use in unleaded gasoline, focusing in particular on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential effects of manganese emissions resulting from use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MMT on public health and welfare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency remains concerned regarding the issue of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese emissions from vehicles utilizing fuels containing MMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From a hazard identification perspective, manganese can clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be toxic to the central nervous system, the respiratory system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the male reproductive system. The level of manganese which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may safely be breathed over a lifetime is not known with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precision. EPA has assessed potential health risks associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with potential exposures utilizing a Reference Concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(RfC), which is defined as an estimate (with uncertainty spanning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps an order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure level for the human population (including sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpopulations) that is likely to be without appreciable risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deleterious noncancer effects during a lifetime of exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning with existing data on the effects of manganese 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures, the Agency utilized its standard procedure to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a verified Reference Concentration (RfC) of 0.05 &mu;g/m3. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to comments and criticisms by Ethyl and others, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency then utilized a variety of additional techniques to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider potential alternative RfC's based on additional data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the occupational exposure study on which the current RfC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based (discussed in detail in Section VI&hyph;B&hyph;4 above). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques judged by EPA scientists to be most appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced alternative candidate RfC's ranging from 0.09 to 0.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&mu;g/m3. Since any formal revision of the present verified RfC of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.05 &mu;g/m3 based on the ORD reassessment will occur in the future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and could not be completed prior to the deadline for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision, I have evaluated the potential health effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with use of MMT in unleaded gasoline based on all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the likely values, focusing in particular on a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative RfC of 0.1 &mu;g/m3 and the present RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Utilizing the newest and most accurate data available on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal exposures to particulate emissions of manganese from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicular sources, Agency scientists also prepared an exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in which they attempted to predict the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases in personal exposure to particulate manganese that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would occur in Riverside, California urban areas if MMT were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be used in all unleaded gasoline. If MMT were utilized in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unleaded gasoline at the specified concentration in urban areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to Riverside, California, the Agency's exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment predicts that the exposures of forty to fifty percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the population in such areas to airborne manganese levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would exceed the present verified RfC of 0.05 &mu;g/m3, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures of five to ten percent would exceed manganese levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding a potential alternative RfC of 0.1 &mu;g/m3. Although it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is impossible to state whether a health risk would definitely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist at the projected exposure levels, neither can the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of such a risk be ruled out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is reasonable to anticipate that persons living near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major thoroughfares and in inner cities, often among the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically disadvantaged Americans, will be disproportionately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented among persons with higher manganese exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, there is reason to believe certain subpopulations such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the young, the elderly, and persons with certain preexisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, might be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible to any adverse effects of manganese exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain occupational groups who work in proximity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicular emissions such as toll takers, parking garage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendants, traffic policemen, taxi dispatchers, and service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
station attendants, are represented in the Agency's exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates only to the extent of their prevalence in the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. These occupational groups would likely experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese exposures attributable to MMT use near or even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the highest predicted exposures
<FOOTCITE>84</FOOTCITE>
. I realize that if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ethyl is granted the requested waiver, MMT would not be utilized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately in all congested urban areas. Some of the urban 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas with higher vehicular usage are areas which will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to begin using a cleaner gasoline referred to as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``reformulated gasoline'' beginning in 1995. If Ethyl were to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain the waiver under section 211(f)(4) which is the subject of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this decision, MMT could not be used in reformulated gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless and until Ethyl obtained an additional waiver under Clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Air Act section 211(k)(2)(D). However, I am nevertheless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned about the effects of potential MMT use in areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to utilize reformulated gasoline, both because a waiver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 211(f)(4) of the Act is a necessary prerequisite to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of MMT in either conventional or reformulated gasoline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and because Ethyl has made it clear that it does not seek the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present waiver solely to permit use in conventional gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Agency realizes that exposures to manganese deemed acceptable in particular industrial or occupational contexts
will often significantly exceed the levels considered by EPA to pose acceptable risks for the general population.
The establishment of appropriate limits for occupational exposures to manganese is an entirely separate process
from the establishment of an RfC for the general population. Nevertheless, I do not believe it would be appropriate
to completely disregard the likelihood of substantial incremental additions to manganese exposure for certain
categories of working Americans where such increased exposure would be attributable solely to approval of MMT use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I have concluded based on the assessments prepared by EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientists that, if I were to approve use of MMT in unleaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gasoline at the specified concentration, a significant number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons could thereby be exposed to manganese concentrations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ambient air which approach or exceed the current RfC or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
candidate RfCs described in the risk assessment. Although all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessments have some degree of uncertainty, in some cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is reasonable to conclude that the risk of adverse health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects is either very great or very small because estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels are either far above or far below a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health effect level. However, this is not the case with MMT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is not possible based on the present information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conclude whether specific adverse health effects will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with manganese exposures in the vicinity of or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the RfC, neither is it possible to conclude that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse health effects will not be associated with such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures. Moreover, it is likely that, if adverse effects do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur as a result of MMT usage, such effects will be subtle and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to detect. In these circumstances, I am very reluctant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to conduct a massive experiment in which the citizens of numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American cities are subjected to the additional exposures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particulate manganese associated with MMT use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I am aware of the proposal by Ethyl that EPA conditionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant its waiver application for HiTEC 3000, with conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which would require Ethyl to develop in a specified period the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional health effects and exposure data necessary to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present uncertainties in the risk assessment, require Ethyl to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct ambient monitoring of particulate manganese levels in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain cities where unleaded gasoline containing MMT would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold, and provide for prompt withdrawal of HiTEC 3000 from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market in the event that ambient monitoring were to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airborne manganese levels exceeding a specified level of concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g. 0.1 &mu;g/m3). However, I believe that the additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on health effects and exposure necessary to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater assurance that manganese emissions from MMT use will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize public health should be provided before I decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to expose Americans to such emissions on even a temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis. Moreover, Ethyl's proposal to monitor ambient exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels would not assure that personal exposures exceeding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified threshold do not occur. The EPA risk assessment makes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it clear that a substantial portion of the population exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airborne manganese as a result of MMT use would be expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience personal exposures exceeding measured ambient exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels.

I recognize that there are some benefits that will be likely to accrue from approval of MMT use. In addition to the obvious
economic benefits associated with reductions in petroleum use and in fuel prices, there might also be some favorable
health and environmental effects. It is probable that, if MMT use were to result in reduced NO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from motor vehicles, this would be accompanied by some site-specific decreases in ozone formation. The
small decreases in cancer risks claimed by Ethyl are considerably more speculative and cannot be quantified with
existing information. In any case, it is not possible for me to weigh any modest hypothetical decrease in cancer risk
or limited site-specific ozone benefit against a risk of effects on the nervous system that could significantly decrease
the quality of life for a large number of individuals. In addition, EPA is or will be taking a number of other actions
under the Clean Air Act to reduce emissions of carcinogenic air pollutants and to limit ozone formation.

(55 FR 34120, August 21, 1990). Reductions in carcinogenic toxic emissions (and NO

gasoline in 1995 promulgated under section 211(k) of the Act as amended in 1990 (59 FR 7716, February 16, 1994) and as
a result of the Agency's vehicle-based refueling emissions regulations (59 FR 16262, April 6, 1994). EPA has already
issued tighter tailpipe standard for NO

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the EPA analyses described in this decision and on the administrative record compiled by EPA as part of this
decision, I have concluded that there is a reasonable basis for concern about the effects on public health that could
result if EPA were to approve use of MMT in unleaded gasoline pursuant to Ethyl's application. I have also concluded
that the actual and hypothetical benefits which could accrue from MMT use are insufficient to outweigh the concerns
regarding potential adverse health effects. In circumstances where there is substantial uncertainty regarding
the nature of potential health effects which would result if a fuel additive waiver were approved, the burden of resolving
such uncertainties should fall on the waiver applicant rather than on the public. This policy is consistent with the
general policy established by the recently promulgated health effects testing rule, which requires that manufacturers
of new fuels or fuel additives complete all necessary testing prior to registration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons set forth above, utilizing the discretion afforded me under section 211(f)(4) of the Act,
I am today denying Ethyl's request for a waiver of the section 211(f)(1) prohibitions against the use of MMT in unleaded
gasoline. As previously stated in this decision, should Ethyl wish to undertake research intended to alleviate the
present uncertainties concerning the adverse health effects which could be associated with the use of MMT in unleaded
gasoline, the Agency will work with Ethyl to resolve the details of the needed research. If Ethyl decides to undertake
the research which is needed, and which would likely be required in any case to register MMT for unleaded gasoline under
the Agency's recently promulgated fuel and fuel additive health effects testing regulations, EPA will reconsider
granting a waiver to Ethyl at that time.

EPA has determined that this action does not meet any of the criteria for classification as a significant regulatory
action under Executive Order 12866. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. This action is not a ``rule''
as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because EPA has not published, and is not required
to publish, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), or any other
law. Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibility analysis addressing the impact of this
action on small entities.

This is a final Agency action of national applicability. Jurisdiction to review this action lies exclusively in the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicial review of
this action is available only by the filing of a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit within 60 days of August 17, 1994. Under section 307(b)(2) of the Act, today's action may not be challenged
later in a separate judicial proceeding brought by the Agency to enforce the statutory prohibitions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA, provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide
registrations be amended to delete one or more uses. The Act further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA
must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thereafter, the Administrator may approve such a request.

This notice announces receipt by the Agency of applications from registrants to delete uses in the 10 pesticide registrations
listed in the following Table 1. These registrations are listed by registration number, product names and the specific
uses deleted. Users of these products who desire continued use on crops or sites being deleted should contact the applicable
registrant before November 15, 1994 to discuss withdrawal of the applications for amendment. This 90&hyph;day period
will also permit interested members of the public to intercede with registrants prior to the Agency approval of the
deletion.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(f)(1) of FIFRA, provides that a registrant of a pesticide product may at any time request that any of its pesticide
registrations be amended to delete one or more uses. The Act further provides that, before acting on the request, EPA
must publish a notice of receipt of any such request in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Thereafter, the Administrator may approve such a request.

II. Intent to Delete Uses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces receipt by the Agency of applications from registrants to delete uses in the 14 pesticide registrations
listed in the following Table 1. These registrations are listed by registration number, product names and the specific
uses deleted. Users of these products who desire continued use on crops or sites being deleted should contact the applicable

will also permit interested members of the public to intercede with registrants prior to the Agency approval of the
deletion.

IV. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins,
at the address given above, postmarked before November 15, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation
will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous
cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action
are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to
fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements.

V. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested
cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1&hyph;year after the
date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as
prescribed in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern,
or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific
disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders. Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide
products which are currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment
prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing
stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided
that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions
to these general rules will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 During fiscal years 1991, 1993 and 1994, EPA published notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing the availability of reregistration eligibility decision documents for the listed pesticide active
ingredients. These REDs were issued as final documents, with a 60&hyph;day comment period. In these REDs, EPA provided
its regulatory position on the current registered uses of these pesticides and set forth certain requirements for
product reregistration eligibility. There were no comments for the following REDs: Barium Metaborate, Boric Acid,
Butylate, Daminozide, Methiocarb, OBPA, Oxytetracycline, Warfarin and Sulfuryl Fluoride. Comments were received
for Heptachlor but did not result in any amendments to the RED.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The OPPTS Health Effects Test Guidelines for developmental toxicity (OPPTS 870.3700) will replace the Subdivision
F Pesticide Assessment Guideline Section 83&hyph;3 (FIFRA) and 40 CFR 798.4900 (TSCA). The guideline for reproductive
and fertility effects (OPPTS 870.3800) will replace the Subdivision F Pesticide Assessment Guideline Section 83&hyph;4,
under FIFRA, and 40 CFR 798.4700, under TSCA. These revised guidelines were drafted by an inter-agency work group
comprised of experts in the areas of developmental and reproductive toxicity. The proposed testing requirements
incorporated into these developmental toxicity and reproductive and fertility effects guidelines were reviewed
at a joint meeting of the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and the Science Advisory Board (SAB) in December, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revised guidelines will significantly improve the Agency's ability to identify and characterize potential
effects on the reproductive system and/or the developing fetus from exposure to chemicals. Availability of these
revised guidelines will enhance the ability of pesticide registrants and industrial chemical manufacturers to
plan, estimate costs of, and design studies that EPA currently requires for pesticides under 40 CFR Part 158 or may
require by test rule or consent agreement for industrial chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All interested parties are encouraged to submit comments on the proposed draft guidelines for developmental and
reproductive toxicity studies. Specific comments should reference the document title, section number, and paragraph
or subparagraph of the proposed guideline. Recommended technical or scientific changes/modifications should
be supported by current scientific/technical knowledge and include supporting references.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the proposed guidelines will be considered by the Agency and such modifications of the guidelines as are
considered to be of scientific and technical merit will be considered for inclusion before the guidelines are published
in a final form.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FEMA regulations 44 CFR 63, Subpart B, sets forth procedures to be followed by State authorities for certification
of structures subject to imminent collapse as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or current of water
exceeding anticipated cyclincal levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When a claim for flood insurance benefits is filed by an insured, the State is asked to collect data at the site of the
threatened structure demonstrating that the condition of the structure meets criteria for certification that it
is subject to imminent collapse. Such a certification is necessary for insured property owners to file claims for
relocation or demolition benefits established under P.L. 100&hyph;242.

Summary

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for
a cooperative agreement with the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) to evaluate workplace exposures
and conduct health assessments of workers exposed to asbestos in a large mining, milling, and production center located
in Asbest, Russia. Approximately $150,000 will be available in FY 1994 to fund the cooperative agreement. The award
will begin on or about September 30, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding
estimates may vary and are subject to change. Continuation award(s) within the project period will be made on the basis
of satisfactory progress and the availability of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to assist the FIOH in further developing and strengthening epidemiologic
research, surveillance and monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and training in order to promote the further understanding of the prevention of occupational respiratory disease.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CDC will provide scientific, epidemiologic, engineering, environmental, and clinical technical assistance
to the recipient, as needed, for successful completion of this project; collaborate with the recipient on the methods
for the collection, tabulation analysis, and publication of the data related to the project; assist in the development
of the overall plan or study design for this project; assist in the design and implementation of the evaluation plan
for the project; coordinate the training of the appropriate grantee staff in technical and scientific procedures
necessary for the successful completion of the project; and assist in the development of a series of symposia to present
findings, provide training, and provide for the dissemination of information relevant to the prevention of occupational
lung disease due to asbestos exposure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assistance will be provided only to the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health (FIOH) for conducting this evaluation.
No other applications will be solicited. The program announcement and application kit have been sent to FIOH. The
FIOH is the only appropriate and qualified institution to provide the services specified under this cooperative
agreement for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a large asbestos mining, milling, and production activity in Asbest, Siberia, which produces in excess of
1,100,000 tons of asbestos and 300,000,000 tons of crushed stone annually. This mine supplies all of Russia's asbestos
and is one of its major exporting resources. There is an existing medical surveillance program in effect for the more
than 10,000 employees which could be reviewed for major health effects of asbestos. Russia does not have the expertise
or resources to conduct this review and analysis. However, it has expressed a desire to collaborate with others to
accomplish this effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finland has an existing working relationship with Russia and has the expertise and ability to initiate and coordinate
a study of this magnitude. FIOH, NIOSH, and the Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational Diseases of the Academy
of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia, all serve as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) Workers' Health
Program which has as one of its top priorities the prevention of occupational respiratory diseases. This shared focus
has enabled FIOH to develop a unique collaborative relationship with the Institute of Industrial Hygiene and Occupational
Diseases of the Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russia. As a result of this relationship, FIOH will be granted
access to the Asbest mining region and will be given support from the requisite Russian agencies so that they can successfully
accomplish the work required under this cooperative agreement. No one in the United States or its territories has
this unique capability.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 21 CFR 130.17 concerning temporary permits to facilitate market testing of foods deviating from
the requirements of the standards of identity promulgated under section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 341), FDA is giving notice that a temporary permit has been issued to The Pillsbury Co., Technology Center,
330 University Ave. SE., Minneapolis, MN 55414&hyph;2198. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permit covers limited interstate marketing tests of experimental packs of canned asparagus. The test product
deviates from the U.S. standard of identity for canned asparagus (21 CFR 155.200) in that the test product will contain
added zinc chloride in an amount necessary to retain the green color of the product (at a maximum level of 75 parts per
million of zinc in the finished food). The test product meets all requirements of the standard, with the exception
of the variation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This permit provides for the temporary marketing of 10 thousand cases, each containing 12 425-gram (15-ounce) cans,
of the test product. The product will be manufactured at Green Giant Co., 711 East Main St., Dayton, WA 99328&hyph;0026.
The product will be distributed in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this permit, the name of the product is ``canned asparagus.'' Each of the ingredients used in the
food must be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of 21 CFR parts 101 and 130. This permit is effective
for 15 months, beginning on the date the test product is introduced or caused to be introduced into interstate commerce,
but no later than November 15, 1994.

Notice is hereby given that a joint final Environmental Impact Report/Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) has been prepared
by the Bureau of Land Management and the County of San Bernardino for the proposed Bolo Station Class III landfill.
The proposed Federal action comprises a land exchange involving 2.5 sections of public land, 2 rights-of-ways for
access and utilities, and a plan amendment to the California Desert Conservation Area (CDCA) Plan.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed land exchange involves 2.5 sections of public land of which 1.5 sections are designated Multiple Use
Class L (Limited Use) under the CDCA Plan. The proposed use as landfill is not consistent with the guidelines for Class
L, and the proposed amendment would designate the 1.5 sections as Class M (Moderate Use). The guidelines for Class
M allow disposal of public lands for potential landfill purposes. The proposed 3 sections of private land to be acquired
contain tortoise habitat, including critical habitat, recreational value and land in the proposed East Mojave National
Park.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed landfill site is located between Amboy and Cadiz, south of Highway 66 and about 35 miles northeast of the
City of Twentynine Palms. The proposed landfill consists of 4800 acres of which 2100 acres would be used for the landfill.
Solid waste would be sorted and processed for recyclables at a Materials Recovery Facility in Southern California.
The residue would be packed into containers and transported by train to the Bolo Station site. At full operation, approximately
21,000 tons per day of solid waste would be transported, and the facility would be operated between 60-years and 100-years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Besides the proposed action, two alternatives and a no-action alternative are analyzed. The EIR/EIS analyzes the
affects of the proposed action on such environmental issues as ground water, air quality, geology, visual resources
and wildlife among other resources. Copies of the Final EIR/EIS are located in the California Desert District Office,
Riverside, California and in the Needles Resource Area Office, 101 W. Spikes Rd., Needles, CA.

Sealed bids will be considered only if received in the Rio Puerco Resource Area Office, 435 Montano Rd., NE., Albuquerque,
New Mexico 87107, before 10 a.m. on November 15, 1994, the day of the sale. Oral bids will be accepted commencing at 10:30
a.m., following the opening of all sealed bids, at the same place on the same sale date. Sealed bids of less than the appraised
fair market value will be rejected. The apparent highest qualified sealed bid will be publicly declared by the Authorized
Officer. The apparent highest qualified sealed bid will then become the starting point for the oral bidding. If no
apparent qualified sealed are received, the oral bidding will start at the appraised fair market value. In the absence
of oral bids, the apparent highest qualified sealed bid will establish the sale price for that parcel. In the event
that two or more sealed bids are received containing valid bids of the same amount for the same parcel, and no higher
oral bid is received for that parcel, the determination of which is to be considered the highest designated bid will
be by supplemental bidding. In such a case, the high bidders will be allowed to submit oral or sealed bids as designated
by the Authorized Officer. After oral bids, if any, are received, the highest qualifying bid, whether sealed or oral,
shall be declared by the Authorized Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bidders must be 18 years of age or over and United States citizens, and corporations must be subject to the laws of any
State or of the United States. Apparent high bidders must submit proof of these requirements within 15 days after the
sale date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice advises the public that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Southeast Region, proposes to establish a
national wildlife refuge in the vicinity of St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana. The purpose of the proposed refuge is to
protect, enhance, and manage a valuable wetland area known as the Big Branch Marsh, which is threatened by urban expansion
from the city of New Orleans. A Draft Environmental Assessment and Land Protection Plan for the proposed refuge has
been developed by Service biologists in coordination with the State of Louisiana, the Northshore Coast Watch, the
Coalition to Restore Louisiana, the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation, the St. Tammany Sportsmen's League, and
the St. Tammany Police Jury. The assessment considers the biological, environmental, and socioeconomic effects
of establishing the refuge. The assessment also evaluates three alternative actions and their potential impacts
on the environment. Written comments or recommendations concerning the proposal are welcomed and should be sent
to the address below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary objectives of the proposed Big Branch Marsh National Wildlife Refuge are to provide: (1) Habitat for a
natural diversity of wildlife associated with the Big Branch Marsh, (2) wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl,
(3) nesting habitat for wood ducks, (4) habitat for non-game migratory birds, and (5) opportunities for compatible
public outdoor recreation, such as hunting, fishing, hiking, birdwatching, and environmental education and interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed refuge area is located along the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana,
just south of the town of Lacombe. It is bordered by Cane Bayou on the west, Lake Pontchartrain on the south, and the Southern
Railway trestle on the east. The northern boundary runs along several parish roads and bayous which separate the marsh
from residential development south of U.S. Highway 190, an east-west highway that runs from Slidell to Mandeville,
Louisiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rufuge would consist of up to 12,000 acres of land acquired in fee title from willing sellers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major wildlife values are the numerous species of shorebirds, wading birds, neotropical migratory birds, and
wintering watefowl. Raptors include the osprey, northern harrier, peregrine falcon, and bald eagle. White-tailed
deer, mink, raccoon, and river otter are among the many species of mammals dependent on the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The entire area serves as an important nursery for fish, shrimp, and crabs and represents one of the better fish production
areas on Lake Pontchartrain. The estuaries, ponds, and bayous provide a diverse mix of brackish and freshwater habitats
for many species of saltwater and freshwater fish of both recreational and commercial importance.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Draft General Management Plan/Implementation Plan Alternatives/Environmental Impact Statement describes
and analyzes a proposed action and four alternatives for future management and use of Lake Chelan National Recreation
Area as required by the consent decree that was approved and entered on April 22, 1991, in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Washington (Civil Case No. C&hyph;89&hyph;1342D). Under the proposed action,
the National Park Service would not manipulate the Stehekin River or remove or manipulate woody debris except to protect
public roads and bridges. The active sand, rock, and gravel borrow pit would be maintained at less than or equal to its
current size. Fire suppression, prescribed natural fire, management-ignited prescribed fire, and selective manual
fuel reductions would be used to restore or replicate the natural role of fire. Firewood would be provided at fair market
value instead of a set permit fee and there would be no guaranteed cordage per year. The airstrip would remain open.
Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, riparian areas, and high visual sensitivity
areas. Under the no-action/minimum requirements alternative, river erosion and flooding would be controlled only
to protect life, health, public roads, and bridges. Where feasible, federal lands would be treated with prescribed
fire to reduce fuels. Firewood would be obtained from harvesting 1-acre woodlots. The airstrip would remain open.
Land protection would emphasize wetlands, shoreline characteristics, high scenic quality, water quality, visitor
access, restriction of unsightly development, and development on areas with gradients greater than 20%. Under alternative
A, new river shoreline or bank protection structures would be prohibited. The mining of sand, rock, and gravel would
be prohibited within the valley. Natural ignitions would be suppressed on the valley floor for the protection of human
life and property. Woodlot cutting of firewood would stop immediately. The airstrip would be closed and restored
to natural conditions. The Stehekin Valley road between the Landing and Cottonwood Camp would be converted to a trail.
All NPS and concession housing and maintenance facilities would be substantially reduced and located at the Landing.
Land protection would involve acquisition, on a willing seller/willing buyer basis, or by eminent domain authority,
of all private lands within the recreation area. Under alternative B, riverbank protection structures would be allowed
if no adverse environmental impacts would result. Mining of sand, rock, and gravel in the valley would be prohibited.
Fire and forest fuels would be managed to restore or replicate the natural role of fire. Firewood would be provided
at fair market value instead of a set permit fee. There would be no guarantee of firewood cordage per year. The airstrip
would be closed. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands, riparian areas, and high
visual sensitivity areas. Under alternative C, protection of public or private improvements threatened by river
erosion and flooding would be allowed. The size of the borrow put would remain constant. Selective manual forest fuel
reduction techniques would be used to reduce hazard forest fuel loadings. Firewood would be supplied from administrative
wood and natural selection ecoforestry selective cutting from a designated area. The airstrip would be managed by
the National Park Service for emergency use only. Land protection would emphasize high flood influence areas, wetlands,
and high visual sensitivity areas. Major impact topics assessed for the proposed action and alternatives include
natural and cultural resources and the socioeconomic environment, including the local and regional economy.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission hereby gives notice that it has initiated an investigation pursuant to section 751(b) of the Tariff
Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. &sect;1675(b)) (the Act) to review its determination in investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;473
(Final). The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether an industry in the United States would be materially
injured, or would be threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States would
be materially retarded, by reason of imports of ceiling fans from China if the antidumping order regarding such merchandise
were to be modified or revoked.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Ceiling fans are provided for in subheading 8414.51.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

Although the scope of Commerce's investigation included both ceiling fans and oscillating fans, the Commission
found these fans to be separate like products of separate industries and determined accordingly on the question of
injury.

Background._
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 25, 1991, the Department of Commerce determined that imports of ceiling fans from China are being sold in
the United States at less than fair value (LTFV) within the meaning of section 731 of the Act (19 U.S.C. &sect;1673)
(56 F.R. 55271, October 25, 1991) (an amendment to its determination, modifying the margins according to specific
companies, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 9, 1991 (56 F.R. 64240)); and on December 2, 1991, the Commission determined, pursuant to section 735(b)(1)
of the Act (19 U.S.C. &sect;1673d(b)(1)), that an industry in the United States was materially injured by reason by
imports of such LTFV merchandise. Accordingly, Commerce ordered that dumping duties be imposed on such imports (December
9, 1991, 56 F.R. 64240).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On March 2, 1994, however, Commerce published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a revision of its original dumping determination, effectively excluding one of the Chinese producers from the order
and reducing the margin for non-specified firms (59 F.R. 9956, March 2, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Following review in the U.S. Court of International Trade, Commerce revoked the antidumping duty order applicable
to oscillating fans (58 F.R. 30026, May 25, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 4, 1994, the Commission received a request to review its affirmative determination in investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;473
(Final) pursuant to section 751(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. &sect;1675(b)). The request was filed by Encon Industries,
Inc., Fort Worth, TX. On June 10, 1994, the Commission requested written comments in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 F.R. 30036) as to whether the changed circumstances alleged by the petition were sufficient to warrant a review
investigation. On August 10, 1994, after reviewing comments received in response to that request, the Commission
determined that the alleged changed circumstances were sufficient to warrant a review investigation.

On June 23, 1994, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Gulf States Tube Division
of Quanex Corp., Rosenberg, TX, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened
with material injury by reason of imports from Italy of certain seamless carbon and alloy standard, line, and pressure
steel pipe that are alleged to be subsidized by the Government of Italy and by reason of LTFV imports from Argentina,
Brazil, Germany, and Italy of such pipe. Accordingly, effective June 23, 1994, the Commission instituted countervailing
duty investigation No. 701&hyph;TA&hyph;362 (Preliminary) and antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;707&hyph;710

Effective June 16, 1994, the Commission instituted the subject investigations and established a schedule for their
conduct (59 FR 36212, July 15, 1994). Subsequently, the Department of Commerce extended the date for its final determination
in the investigation of silicomanganese from the People's Republic of China to October 31, 1994 (59 FR 40008, August
5, 1994). The Commission, therefore, is revising its schedule in the silicomanganese investigations to conform
with Commerce's new schedule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On April 25, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Anthony L. Cappelli, M.D. (Respondent), of Los Angeles, California, proposing
to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, BC2901230, as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged
that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
Specifically, the Order to Show Cause alleged that between January 1992 and February 1993, Respondent allowed an
unauthorized person to order controlled substances by permitting this person to use Respondent's DEA number; this
person also used Respondent's DEA number to issue unauthorized prescriptions during this time period in question;
this person used the controlled substances obtained in this manner to perform unlawful abortions, one of which resulted
in the death of one of the patients; and Respondent dispensed controlled substances at an unregistered location during
the time period in question.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by Respondent and the DEA has received no response thereto. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d)
and 1301.54(e), Respondent is deemed to have waived his opportunity for a hearing. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
now enters his final order in this matter without a hearing and based upon the investigative file. 21 CFR 1301.57.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In January of 1993, the Santa Ana Police Department discovered the body of a female in an alley, at or near a medical clinic,
the Clinica Femenina (clinic). Subsequent investigation revealed that the death of the female was caused by a failed
abortion attempt performed at the clinic by the owner who was not authorized to practice medicine (and thus not licensed
to perform abortions) in the State of California. An autopsy revealed that diazepam, a Schedule IV controlled substance,
was in the deceased's system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A search warrant was served on the clinic by the Santa Ana Police Department on January 21, 1993. The search revealed
that the owner had ordered over 8,000 dosage units of controlled substances using Respondent's DEA number. The search
also revealed that the owner issued prescriptions for various controlled substances using Respondent's DEA number.
The clinic was not Respondent's DEA registered location and, in fact, did not have a DEA registration. The owner was
subsequently arrested by the Santa Ana police and charged with manslaughter and the matter is pending trial at this
time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly after the search warrant was served, Respondent was interviewed by the Santa Ana police and an investigator
of the California Medical Board. Respondent admitted to them that he allowed the clinic to use his DEA registration
number to order controlled substances to obtain drugs used in conjunction with abortions. Respondent explained
that he was hired to perform abortions on an as needed basis and was paid $80 for each abortion. He performed an abortion
about once a week or every other week. He was aware that the owner was not a licensed physician. He was not aware that the
owner had issued controlled substance prescriptions using his DEA number. Respondent also noted that there were
occasions that the owner called him to perform an abortion on short notice but that Respondent was unable to make the
appointment. When Respondent inquired of the owner how the operation had been performed, she simply explained that
the patient ``had been taken care of''. Respondent also explained that the owner had witnessed him perform abortions
on numerous occasions and that she could probably perform the operation, barring any unforeseen complications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating whether Respondent's registration by the Drug Enforcement Administration would be inconsistent
with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator considers the factors enumerated in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). They are
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether a registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Deputy Administrator
is not required to make findings with respect to each of the factors listed above. Instead, he has the discretion to
give each factor the weight he deems appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. See David
E. Trawick, D.D.S., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Docket No. 88&hyph;69, 53 FR 5326 (1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proceeding factors, two, four and five apply. Respondent allowed an unauthorized person to use his DEA number
to order controlled substances for dispensing and administering controlled substances at an unregistered location.
Respondent allowed the clinic's owner to acquire and dispense controlled substances through the use of Respondent's
DEA registration number. Under the circumstances, Respondent knew or should have known that the clinic's owner would
use his DEA number, not only for ordering, dispensing and issuing prescriptions for controlled substances, but also
for administering during unauthorized abortions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By allowing an unregistered and unauthorized person to use his DEA number, Respondent was responsible for any use
and misuse of that number. Moreover, such a violation is aggravated by the fact that Respondent allowed a non-practitioner
to use his DEA number at an unregistered location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration,
BC2901230, previously issued to Anthony L. Cappelli, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked, and any pending applications
for the renewal of such registration, be, and they are, denied. This order is effective September 16, 1994.

(j) Plans do not pay any plan-level investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees to the Bank

preclude the payment of investment advisory fees or similar fees by the Funds to the Bank under the terms of an investment
advisory agreement adopted in accordance with section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other agreement
between the Bank and the Funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

invested in a Fund which is increasing such fees. Such notice shall be accompanied by the Termination Form, as defined
in paragraph (i) of section III below; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) In the event of an addition of a Secondary Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, provided by
the Bank to the Fund for which a fee is charged or an increase in the rate of any fee paid by the Funds to the Bank for any Secondary
Service, as defined in paragraph (h) of section III below, that results either from an increase in the rate of such fee
or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over an existing rate for such
Secondary Service which had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan, in accordance with paragraph (h) of
this section II, the Bank will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service
for which a fee is charged or fee increase, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter,
or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount
of the additional service for which a fee is charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary
of each of the Plans invested in a Fund which is adding a service or increasing fees. Such notice shall be accompanied
by the Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the authorization is terminable at will by any of the Plans, without penalty to such Plans. Such termination will
be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund held by the Plans requesting termination within one business
day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means at the option
of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice of termination; provided that if, due
to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plans cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) failure by the Second Fiduciary to return the Termination Form on behalf of a Plan will be deemed to be an approval
of the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or increase in the rate of any fees, if such Termination
Form is supplied pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section II, and will result in the continuation of the authorization,
as described in paragraph (h) of this section II, of the Bank to engage in the transactions on behalf of such Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form, annually during the first quarter of each calendar year,

2. The Plans involved in the transactions for which the Bank requests exemptive relief are numerous Plans for which
the Bank has acted or will act as fiduciary and has exercised or will exercise investment discretion with respect to
all or a portion of the assets of such Plans.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For this reason, certain specific information relating to each individual involved Plan does not appear in the application.
However, it is anticipated that the Plans include or will include various employee benefit plans, as defined by section
3(3) of the Act, and certain plans or trusts, as described in section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. These Plans are sponsored
or maintained by parties unrelated to the Bank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Such Plans include, among others: (1) pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, and other retirement plans which are
qualified for tax purposes under section 401(a) of the Code, (2) voluntary employees' beneficiary associations
and other welfare benefit plans, and (3) individual retirement accounts and simplified employee pension plans,
as described in section 408 of the Code. The Bank serves as fiduciary to these Plans through the management of the CIFs
in which the Plans invest or through providing individual management or advice to the Plans.

It is represented that the Bank, as of October 23, 1992, had under management approximately $760 million in assets
from approximately 400 Plans. The Bank receives compensation for serving as fiduciary with respect to these Plans
in accordance with standard published fee schedules or as otherwise agreed upon by the Bank and the sponsors of such
Plans.

The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the provision of services by the Bank or its affiliates to the Plans
satisfies the requirements for statutory exemption, as set forth in section 408(b)(2) of the Act and 29 CFR 2550.408(b)(2)
of the Department's regulation. To the extent that such provision of services to the Plan by the Bank or its affiliates
does not satisfy the requirements of section 408(b)(2) of the Act, the Department, herein, is offering no relief.

3. The Bank or its affiliates also provide services to numerous Funds. The Funds are open-end investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because the Bank would like the exemption to apply prospectively
to any Fund to which the Bank or any of its affiliates may provide services, the Bank represents that it cannot supply
detailed information on each such future Fund. However, the Bank has provided a detailed description with respect
to a certain Fund, the HighMark Group (HighMark), which is currently operating and to which it provides services.
The Bank represents that all future Funds will assume similar structures and Plan investments therein will be subject
to the terms and conditions of this exemption. The structure of HighMark is summarized in paragraph 4 below. To the
extent Plans for which the Bank serves as fiduciary are currently invested in HighMark, the Bank represents that such
investments were made in compliance with Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4 (PTCE 77&hyph;4).

4. HighMark, a Massachusetts business trust organized on March 10, 1987, is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 as a diversified, open-end, management investment company. HighMark is governed by a board of trustees
(the HighMark Trustees), all of whom are independent of the Bank. MERUS, a division of the Bank, acts as investment
adviser to HighMark. In the context of registered investment companies, the term ``investment adviser'' generally
refers to the entity that has investment management authority with respect to the assets of the investment company.
In this regard, subject to the general supervision of the HighMark Trustees, MERUS manages each of the separate investment
portfolios within HighMark in accordance with the investment objectives, and policies of each portfolio, makes
decisions with respect to and places orders for all purchases and sales of securities, and maintains records with
respect thereto. In addition, the Bank serves as custodian, sub-administrator, sub-transfer agent, and sub-accountant
to HighMark. It is represented that the Bank may in the future seek to serve in additional capacities for and to provide
additional services to HighMark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HighMark consists of separate investment portfolios with combined total net assets of approximately $1 billion.
It is represented that currently there are eight (8) portfolios in HighMark. Three of these portfolios are invested
in money market instruments (the Money Market Portfolios), and three are invested primarily in non-money market
debt or equity securities (the Non-Money Market Portfolios). The remaining two portfolios of HighMark are the California
Tax-Free Fund, and the Tax-Free Fund.

It is represented that the Tax-Free Fund has been the subject of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) concerning a municipal bond backed by Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company held in the Tax-Free Fund. In July
1991, when Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company was seized by its regulator, the Bank was serving as accountant for
the Tax-Free Fund. It is represented that due to a clerical data entry error and the failure of an employee to follow
established procedures, the impact of the seizure on the value of the bond was not brought to the attention of the management
of the Bank until August 1991. At that time, the Bank represents that it informed the SEC, purchased the bond from the
Tax-Free Fund at par plus accrued interest, and informed shareholders by mailing to them a special prospectus, dated
September 5, 1991. As the situation was corrected promptly, the Bank believes that this should not affect the merits
of the application or the availability of the Tax-Free Fund for investment by the Plan, if deemed appropriate under
the circumstances as authorized by the Second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fibuciary, and if based on criteria set forth in section 404 of the Act.

In the future HighMark may modify, reorganize, or terminate any or all of its portfolios. All existing portfolios
and any portfolios established or modified in the future will be available for investment by the Plans, if deemed appropriate
under the circumstances, as authorized by the Second Fiduciary, and if based on criteria set forth in section 404 of
the Act. However, it is represented that the Bank does not expect the Plans ordinarily to be invested in tax-free funds.

Winsbury Company (Winsbury), located in Columbus, Ohio, serves as the general manager, administrator, and principal
underwriter of HighMark. For these administrative services, Winsbury receives fees computed daily at .20% of the
average net assets of each portfolio of HighMark. Winsbury also receives fees from HighMark for serving as the distributor
of shares in HighMark. Pursuant to a plan of distribution implemented only with respect to the Class A shares for the
Money Market Portfolios, HighMark pays out of the assets attributable to such shares monthly fees to Winsbury in accordance
with Rule 12b&hyph;1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 12b&hyph;1 Fees) equal to .25% of the average daily
net assets attributable to such shares.

on the satisfaction of certain requirements and compliance with various general conditions which are also discussed
below. It is the Bank's expressed intention that the description of these transactions and the conditions of the requested
exemption with respect to such transactions were and will be applicable uniformly to HighMark and to any of the other
Funds for which the Bank serves as the investment advisor and in which the Plans invest.

6. It is represented that the Bank has maintained CIFs in which the Plans have invested in accordance with Regulation
9 promulgated by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service. The Bank has decided to terminate
certain CIFs and to offer to the Plans participating in such CIFs appropriate interests in certain Funds as alternative
investments. Because interests in CIFs generally must be liquidated or withdrawn to effect distributions, the Bank
believes that the interests of the Plans invested in CIFs would be better served by investment in shares of the Funds
which can be distributed in-kind. Also, the Bank believes that the Funds offer the Plans numerous advantages as pooled
investment vehicles. In this regard, the Plans, as shareholders of a Fund, have the opportunity to exercise voting
and other shareholder rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plans, as shareholders of the Funds, as mandated by the SEC, periodically receive certain disclosures concerning
the Funds: (1) a copy of the prospectus which is updated annually; (2) an annual report containing audited financial
statements of the Funds and information regarding such Funds performance (unless such performance information
is included in the prospectus of such Funds); (3) a semi-annual report containing unaudited financial statements;
and (4) at the option of the Funds other pertinent information. With respect to the Plans, the Bank reports all transactions
in shares of the Funds in periodic account statements provided the Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans. Further,
the Bank maintains that the investment performance of the portfolios of the Funds can be monitored daily from information
available in newspapers of general circulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to avoid the potentially large brokerage expenses that would otherwise be incurred, the Bank proposes that
from time to time assets of the CIFs be transferred in-kind to corresponding portfolios of the Funds in exchange for
shares of such Funds. In this regard, some Funds may, as in the case of HighMark, be in existence and operating at the
time of the in-kind transfer of such assets. Some Funds may be created to assume the assets of the terminating CIF. Similarly,
the Bank proposes that from time to time it may be appropriate for an individual Plan for which the Bank serves as fiduciary
to transfer all or a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of its assets in-kind to any of the Funds in exchange for shares of such Funds. In this regard, for example, in the
case of an in-kind exchange between an individual Plan whose portfolio consists of common stock, money market securities,
and real estate, and a Fund that, under its investment policy, invests only in common stock and money market securities,
the exchange would involve all or a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of the common stock and money market securities held by the Plan, if such stock and securities are eligible for
purchase by the Fund,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and would not involve the transfer or exchange of the real estate holdings of such Plan. No brokerage commission or
other fees or expenses (other than customary transfer charges paid to parties other than the Bank or its affiliates)
have been or will be charged to the Plans or the CIFs in connection with the in-kind transfers of assets into the Funds
and the acquisition of shares of the Funds by the Plans or the CIFs. Thus, in addition to retroactive relief, the Bank
has requested prospective relief for transactions which would involve: (1) the in-kind transfer by the CIFs of all
or a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the assets of any of the Plans held in such CIFs to the Funds in exchange for shares of the Fund which subsequently
are distributed to the Plans; or (2) the in-kind transfer of all or a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 portion of the assets of any of the Plans held by the Bank in any capacity as fiduciary on behalf of such Plans to the Funds
in exchange for shares of such Funds; provided that conditions described in section I above are satisfied.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bank maintains that the transfers in-kind of assets in exchange for shares of the Funds are ministerial transactions
performed in accordance with pre-established objective procedures which are approved by the board of trustees of
each Fund. Such procedures require that assets transferred to a Fund: (1) are consistent with the investment objectives,
policies, and restrictions of the corresponding portfolios of such Fund, (2) satisfy the applicable requirements
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Code, (3) have a readily ascertainable market, (4) are liquid, and (5)
are not subject to restrictions on resale. It is represented that assets which do not meet these requirements will
be sold in the open market through an unaffiliated brokerage firm prior to any transfer in-kind. Further, as described
in section I, prior to entering into an in-kind transfer each affected Plan receives certain disclosures from the
Bank and approves such transaction in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank represents that valuation of assets transferred in-kind to the Funds will be established by reference to
independent sources. In this regard, for purposes of the transaction, it is represented that all assets transferred
in-kind are valued in accordance with the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a-7(b) under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement. Further, the
Bank represents that within thirty (30) days of the completion of a transfer in-kind, it will provide to Plans written
confirmation of the identity of each security valued under Rule 17a-7(b)(4), the price of each security, and the identity
of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of the assets transferred. The securities
subject to valuation under Rule 17(a)-7(b)(4) include all securities other than ``reported securities,'' as the
term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the 1934 Act), or those quoted on the
NASDAQ system or for which the principal market is an exchange. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that the value of the assets transferred in-kind will be equal to the aggregate value of the corresponding
portfolios shares of the Fund at the close of business on the date of the transaction. In this regard, it is represented
that for all conversion transactions that occur after the date of this proposed exemption, the Bank, no later than
ninety (90) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets of the Plans or the CIFs in exchange for shares
of the Funds, will mail to the Second Fiduciary a written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by each affected
Plan immediately before the conversion (and the related per unit value or the aggregate dollar value of the units transferred),
and the number of shares in the Funds that are held by each affected Plan following the conversion (and the related per
share net asset value or the aggregate dollar value of the shares received).

7. The Bank has requested retroactive relief, for the in-kind transfer to HighMark that occurred over the weekend
of November 12, 1993. It is represented that on the weekend of November 12, 1993, all of the assets of five CIFs
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
, which were maintained by the Bank and in which the Plans held interests, were transferred to HighMark in exchange
for an appropriate number of shares of certain portfolios of HighMark which have investment objectives and policies
substantially identical to those of the CIFs. At the same time, the five CIFs were terminated and the assets of each,
then consisting of shares in portfolios of HighMark, were distributed in-kind to the Plans participating in such
CIFs based on each Plan's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of the assets of the CIFs on the date of the transaction.

It is represented that the CIFs maintained by the Bank which engaged in the transfer in-kind on November 12, 1993, were
the Balanced Fund, the Flexible Bond Fund A, the Government Fund, the Income and Growth Equity Fund, and the Income
Equity Fund A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bank provided to the Second Fiduciary for each affected Plan disclosures that announced the termination of the
CIFs, summarized the transaction, and otherwise complied with provisions of Section I. It is represented that based
on these disclosures, the Second Fiduciary from each affected Plan approved in writing the transfer of the CIFs assets
to the corresponding portfolios of HighMark, the investment of the assets of the Plans in shares of HighMark, and the
receipt by the Bank of fees for services to HighMark and to the Plans. It is represented that the assets of Plans that
did not approve investment in HighMark were withdrawn from the CIFs and held or invested in appropriate alternative
investments in accordance with the terms of such Plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the transaction, the assets of the five CIFs were reviewed to confirm that such were appropriate investments
for the corresponding portfolios of HighMark into which such assets were transferred. If any of the assets of the five
CIFs were not appropriate for HighMark, it is represented that the Bank sold such assets in the open market through
an unaffiliated brokerage firm prior to the transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that the assets transferred by the five CIFs to HighMark consisted entirely of cash and marketable
securities. For purposes of the transfer in-kind, the value of the securities in each of the five CIFs were determined
based on market values as of the close of business on November 12, 1993, the last business date prior to the transfer.
It is represented that the values were determined in a single valuation using the valuation procedures described
in Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In this regard, it is represented that the ``current market
price'' for specific types of CIF securities involved in the transaction was determined as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the security was a ``reported security'' as the term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the 1934 Act, the last
sale price with respect to such security reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system (the Consolidated
System) for November 12, 1993; or if there were no reported transactions in the Consolidated System that day, the average
of the highest independent bid and the lowest independent offer for such security (reported pursuant to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1
under the 1934 Act), as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the security was not a reported security, and the principal market for such security was an exchange, then the
last sale on such exchange on November 12, 1993; or if there were no reported transactions on such exchange that day,
the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer on such exchange as of the close of business
on November 12, 1993; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the security was not a reported security and was quoted in the NASDAQ system, then the average of the highest independent
bid and lowest independent offer reported on Level 1 of NASDAQ as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For all other securities, the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer as of the close
of business on November 12, 1993, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. For securities in this category,
the Bank represents that it obtained quotations from at least three sources that were either broker-dealers or pricing
services independent of and unrelated to the Bank and, where more than one valid quotation was available, used the
average of the quotations to value the securities, in conformance with interpretations by the SEC and practice under
Rule 17a&hyph;7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that the securities received by the corresponding portfolio of HighMark were valued by such portfolio
for purposes of the transfer in the same manner and on the same day as such securities were valued by the CIFs. The per
share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the shares of each portfolio of HighMark issued to the CIFs were based on the corresponding portfolio's then
current net asset value. It is represented that the aggregate value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio of
HighMark issued to the CIFs were equal to the value of the assets (cash and marketable securities) transferred to such
portfolio as of the close of business on November 12, 1993. It is also represented that the value of a Plan's investment
in shares of a corresponding portfolio of HighMark as of the opening of business on the first business day after the
transaction (November 15, 1993) was equal to the value of such Plan's investment in the CIF as of the close of business
on the last business day prior to the transaction (November 12, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that not later than thirty (30) days after completion of the transaction (December 15, 1993), the
Bank sent by regular mail a written confirmation of the transaction to each affected Plan. Such confirmation contained:
(1) the identity of each security that was valued in accordance with Rule 17a7(b)(4), as described in the paragraph
7(4) above; (2) the price of each such security for purposes of the transaction; and (3) the identity of each pricing
service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. To reiterate the above discussion,
and in accordance with the conditions under section I, similar procedures will occur upon any future in-kind exchanges
between CIFs maintained by the Bank, Plans, and the Funds.

8. It is represented that the Bank currently invests assets of the Plans it manages in shares of the Funds in accordance
with the conditions set forth in PTCE 77&hyph;4. Under certain conditions, PTCE 77&hyph;4 permits the Bank to receive
fees from the Funds under either of two circumstances: (a) where a Plan does not pay any investment management, investment
advisory, or similar fees with respect to the assets of such Plan invested in shares of a Fund for the entire period of
such investment; or (b) where a Plan pays investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees to the Bank
based on the total assets of such Plan from which a credit has been subtracted representing such Plan's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of such investment advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Fund. As such, it is represented that there are two levels
of fees_those fees which the Bank charges to the Plans for serving as trustee with investment discretion or as investment
manager (the Plan-level fees); and those fees the Bank charges to the Funds (the Fund-level fees) for serving as investment
advisor, custodian, or service provider.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is represented that at present the vast majority of Plans for which the Bank acts as a fiduciary do not pay any separate
Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees with respect to the assets of such Plans
invested in shares of the Funds. A few Plans, however, continue to pay Plan-level investment management, investment
advisory, and similar fees and receive credits which represent each of the Plans 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
share of investment advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Funds. The Bank represents that Plan-level fees currently
charged are paid monthly and are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets of a Plan with respect to
which the Bank provides services. It is represented that Plan-level investment management, investment advisory
or similar fees for all of the services provided by the Bank, including services in connection with the automated cash
``sweep'' arrangement, are charged in the form of a single asset-based fee. It is represented that Plan-level fees
are subject to annual minimums for administration and management expressed as flat dollar amounts and are subject
to the application of certain ``break points.'' In addition to the Plan-level fees for investment management, investment
advisory, or similar services, a one-time fee (also a flat dollar amount) may be charged in connection with the establishment
of an account for a Plan, and separate transaction fees may be charged for various administrative transactions, such
as for example, a participant loan. It is represented that depending on the terms of the governing documents of the
Plan, Plan-level fees are paid to the Bank either by the sponsor of the Plan or from the assets of the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, the Bank also receives Fund-level fees. Such Fund-level fees can be divided into: (1) fees paid
to the Bank by a Fund for investment management, investment advisory, or similar services provided to such Fund, and
(2) fees paid to the Bank for administrative, custodial, transfer, accounting, and other Secondary Services provided
either to such Fund or to the distributor of shares of such Funds and its affiliates. For example, with respect to investment
management/advisory services and Secondary Services, the current fee arrangements between the Bank and HighMark
provide for: (1) MERUS, a division of the Bank, to receive fees from HighMark for acting as investment advisor, (2)
the Bank to receive custodian fees from HighMark, (3) the Bank to receive fees from Winsbury for serving as sub-administrator
to HighMark, and (4) the Bank to receive fees from Winsbury Services for services as sub-accountant and sub-transfer
agent provided to HighMark. It is represented that this compensation paid to the Bank for investment advisory services
and Secondary Services is in accordance with various agreements between Winsbury, Winsbury Service, HighMark,
and the Bank. In this regard, it is represented that the HighMark Trustees and the shareholders of HighMark approve
the compensation that the Bank receives from HighMark. Also, the HighMark Trustees approve any changes in the compensation
paid to the Bank for services rendered to HighMark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that the Fund-level fees from HighMark are computed daily and billed monthly. The Bank represents
that at the end of each month and promptly upon receipt of the Fund-level fees from HighMark, for those Plans which pay
to the Bank Plan-level investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees, the Bank currently credits
to each Plan its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 share of all investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees charged by the Bank to HighMark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Under the fee structure proposed in this exemption, it is represented that the arrangement for Plan-level fees
where assets of the Plans managed by the Bank are invested in the Funds is different in several respects from that described
in paragraph 8 above. In this regard, a separate Plan-level fee will be charged to the Plans for basic administrative
services not including investment management.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Such administrative services would include, among others, the Bank's acting as custodian of the assets of a Plan,
maintaining the records of a Plan, preparing periodic reports concerning the status of the Plan and its assets, and
accounting for contributions, benefit distributions, and other receipts and disbursements. It is represented
that these functions performed by the Bank on the Plan-level are separate and distinct from those performed on the
Fund-level by the Bank, by Winsbury, and by Winsbury Services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The fact that certain transactions and fee arrangements are the subject of an administrative exemption does not relieve
the fiduciaries of the Plans from the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act. Thus,
the Department cautions the fiduciaries of the Plans investing in the Funds that they have an ongoing duty under section
404 of the Act to monitor the services provided to the Plans to assure that the fees paid by the Plans for such services
are reasonable in relation to the value of the services provided. Such responsibilities would include determinations
that the services provided are not duplicative and that the fees are reasonable in light of the level of services provided.

In addition, the Department notes that the combined total of all fees received by the Bank directly or indirectly from
the Plan for the provision of services to the Plan and/or to the Fund should not be in excess of ``reasonable compensation''
within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act.

is paid by the Funds to the Bank for such services rendered to such Funds. In addition, the Bank will continue to retain
fees for providing Secondary Services to the Funds.

The applicant maintains that this proposed fee arrangement complies with PTCE 77&hyph;4. However, there is one difference
from PTCE 77&hyph;4 requested by the Bank for which an exemption is required. In this regard, one of the requirements
of PTCE 77&hyph;4 has been that any change in any of the rates of fees would require prior written approval by the Second
Fiduciary of the Plans participating in the Funds. The applicant maintains that where many Plans participate in a
Fund, the addition of a service or any good faith increase in fees could not be implemented until written approval of
such change is obtained from every Second Fiduciary. The applicant proposes an alternative which the Bank maintains
provides the basic safeguards for the Plans and is more efficient, cost effective, and administratively feasible
than those contained in PTCE 77&hyph;4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that in the event of an increase in the rate of any investment management fees, investment advisory
fees, or similar fees, the addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase in the fees for Secondary
Services paid by the Funds to the Bank over an existing rate that had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary, the Bank
will provide, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service or fee increase,
to the Second Fiduciary of all the Plans invested in such Fund a written notice of such additional service or fee increase,
(which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter, or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus
of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount of the additional service or the nature and amount of the increase
in fees). In this regard, such increase in fees for Secondary Services can result either from an increase in the rate
of such fee or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over that which had
been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan. It is represented that providing notice in this way will give the
Second Fiduciary of each of the Plans adequate opportunity to decide whether or not to continue the authorization
of a Plan's investment in any of the portfolios of the Funds in light of the increase in investment management fees,
investment advisory fees, or similar fees, the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or the increase
in fees for any Secondary Services. In addition, the Bank represents that such fee increase will be disclosed to the
Secondary Fiduciaries in a supplement to the Fund's prospectus in the case of an increase in fees for investment management,
investment advisory, or similar services and in the Fund's Statement of Additional Information in the case of an additional
Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or an increase in the fees for Secondary Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. It is represented that the written notice of an additional service for which a fee is charged or a fee increase, as
described in paragraph 9 above, will be accompanied by a Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III,
and by instructions on the use of such form, as described in paragraph (m) of section II, which expressly provide an
election to the Second Fiduciaries to terminate at will any prior authorizations without penalty to the Plans. In
addition, it is represented that the Second Fiduciary will be supplied with a Termination Form annually during the
first quarter of each calendar year, beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year that begins after the date
the grant of this proposed exemption is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and continuing for each calendar year thereafter, regardless of whether there have been any changes in the fees payable
to the Bank or changes in other matters in connection with services rendered to the Funds. However, if the Termination
Form has been provided to the Second Fiduciary in the event of an increase in the rate of any investment management fees,
investment advisory fees, or similar fees, an addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase
in any fees for Secondary Services paid by the Fund to the Bank, then such Termination Form need not be provided again
to the Second Fiduciary until at least six months have elapsed, unless such Termination Form is required to be sent
sooner as a result of another increase in any investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees,
the addition of a Secondary Service for which a fee is charged, or an increase in any fees for Secondary Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Termination Form will contain instructions regarding its use which will state expressly that the authorization
is terminable at will by a Second Fiduciary, without penalty to any Plan, and that failure to return the form will be
deemed to be an approval of the additional Secondary Service or the increase in the rate of any fees and will result in
the continuation of all authorizations previously given by such Second Fiduciary. It is represented that termination
by any Plan of authorization to invest in the Funds will be effected by the Bank selling the shares of the Fund held by
the affected Plan within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile,
or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written notice
of termination. If, due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. It is represented that the rates paid by each of the portfolios of the Funds to the Bank for services rendered may
differ depending on the fee schedule for each portfolio and on the daily net assets in each portfolio. The investment
advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Funds will be based on the different fee rates of each of the portfolios into which
the assets of the Plans are allocated. For example, for services provided to the Money Market Portfolios, the California
Tax Free Fund, and the Tax Free Fund, the Bank receives the following fees from HighMark based on each portfolio's average
daily net assets: (a) .40% of the first $500 million; (b) .35% of the next $500 million; and (c) .30% of the remaining
average daily net assets. For services provided to the Non-Money Market Portfolios, the Bank receives the following
fees from HighMark based on each portfolio's average daily net assets: (a) 1.00% of the first $40 million; and (b) .60%
on the remaining average daily net assets. It is represented that the Bank currently allocates investments by the
Plans among the portfolios offered by HighMark, and proposes to continue to allocate the assets of the Plans among
the portfolios of HighMark and/or any of the Funds under the terms of this proposed exemption.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is represented that the impact of the change in fee structures, described in paragraph 9 above, on aggregate fees
received by the Bank is difficult to determine, because various factors and variables are unique to each Plan. These
factors include the size of the Plan, the extent to which Plan assets are invested in the Funds, and the application
of certain ``break points'' in the schedule of Plan-level fees. Further, Fund size and the application of certain
``break points'' in the rate schedule of Fund-level fees, the identity of the particular investment portfolio of
the Fund into which the Plan assets are allocated, and voluntary waivers by the Bank of Fund-level fees are likely to
be different in each situation and may affect the aggregate amount of fees received by the Bank. In this regard, it is
represented that the combined total of all Plan-level and Fund-level fees received by the Bank for the provision of
services to the Plans and to the Funds, respectively, are not in excess of ``reasonable compensation'' within the
meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The exemption is subject to satisfaction of certain general conditions. Chief among such conditions is the requirement
that the proposed transactions are subject to the prior authorization of a Second Fiduciary, acting on behalf of each
of the Plans, who has been provided with full written disclosure by the Bank. It is represented that the Second Fiduciary
will generally be the administrator, sponsor, or a committee appointed by the sponsor to act as a named fiduciary for
a Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to disclosure, the Second Fiduciary of such Plan will receive in writing in advance of the investment
by a Plan in any of the Funds: (1) a current prospectus for each portfolio of each of the Funds in which such Plan may invest,
(2) a statement describing the investment management fees, investment advisory fees, or similar fees, any fees for
Secondary Services, and all other fees to be charged to or paid by the Plan and by such Funds to the Bank, including the
nature and extent of any differential between the rates of such fees, (3) the reasons why the Bank may consider such
investment(s) to be appropriate for the Plan, (4) a statement describing whether there are any limitations applicable
to the Bank with respect to which assets of a Plan may be invested in the Funds, and, if so, the nature of such limitations,
and (5) upon request of the Second Fiduciary a copy of the proposed exemption and/or the final exemption, if granted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the disclosures provided to the Plan prior to investment in any of the Funds, the Bank represents that
it will routinely provide at least annually to the Second Fiduciary updated prospectuses of the Funds in accordance
with the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the SEC rules promulgated thereunder. Further, the
Second Fiduciary will be supplied, upon request, with a report or statement (which may take the form of the most recent
financial report of such Funds, the current statement of additional information, or some other written statement)
which contains a description of all fees paid by the Fund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that the Bank does not now execute nor in the future intend to execute securities brokerage transactions
for the investment portfolios of any of the Funds, except as and to the extent permitted by the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the event the Bank ever performs brokerage
services for which a fee is paid to the Bank by the investment portfolio of any of the Funds, the Bank represents that
it will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service provide a written notice
which explains the nature of such additional brokerage service and the amount of the fees. Further, the Bank represents
that it will provide at least annually to the Second fiduciary of any Plan that invests in such Funds with a written disclosure
indicating (a) the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions of each Fund's investment portfolio that
are paid to the Bank by such Fund; (b) the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions of each Fund's investment
portfolio that are paid by such Fund to brokerage firms unrelated to the Bank; (c) the average brokerage commissions
per share, expressed as cents per share, paid to the Bank by each portfolio of a Fund; and (d) the average brokerage commissions
per share, expressed as cents per share, paid by each portfolio of a Fund to brokerage firms unrelated to the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of the information disclosed, it is represented that the Second Fiduciary will authorize in writing (i)
the investment of assets of the Plans in shares of the Fund in connection with the transactions set forth herein; (ii)
the investment portfolios of the Funds in which the assets of the Plans may be invested; and (iii) the compensation
received by the Bank in connection with its services to the Funds. It is represented that written authorization will
extend to only those investment portfolios of the Funds with respect to which the Second Fiduciary has received the
written disclosures referred to above and which are specifically mentioned in such authorization. Having obtained
the authorization of the Second Fiduciary, the Bank will be permitted to invest the assets of a Plan among the portfolios
and in the manner covered by the authorization, subject to satisfaction of the other terms and conditions of this proposed
exemption. However, the Bank will not be permitted to invest assets of a Plan in any portfolio not specifically mentioned
in the written authorization. For example, if the written authorization of the Second Fiduciary covered only three
of six portfolios then existing, the Bank could only invest the assets of such Plans in those three portfolios specifically
authorized. Further, if a new portfolio were established under any of the Funds, the Bank could invest assets of a Plan
in such new portfolio only after providing the required disclosures and obtaining from the Second Fiduciary a separate
written authorization which specifically mentions the new portfolio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The receipt of fees, as described above, are generated in connection with the investment in the Funds by the Plans.
These investments are the result of purchases of shares in the Funds and exchanges of assets of the Plans, including
those in CIFs, for shares in the Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented: (1) that Plans and other investors will purchases or sell shares in the Funds in accordance with
standard procedures described in the prospectus for each portfolio of the Funds; (2) that the Plans will pay no sales
commissions or redemption fees in connection with purchase or sales of shares in the Funds by the Plans; (3) that the
Bank will not purchase from or sell to any of the Plans shares of any of the Funds; and (4) the price paid or received by
the Plans for shares of the Funds will be the net asset value per share at the time of such purchase or sale and will be the
same price as any other investor would have paid or received at that time.

In this regard, it is represented that the value of HighMark's shares and the value of each of HighMark's portfolios
are determined on a daily basis. In the case of the Non-Money Market Portfolios, assets are valued at fair or market
value, as required by Rule 2a-4 under the Investment Company Act. In the case of the Money Market Portfolios, the assets
are valued based on the amortized cost method authorized by SEC Rule 2a-7, in order to maintain net asset value at $1.00
per share. Both the Money Market Portfolios and the Non-Money Market Portfolios determine the net asset value per
share for purposes of pricing purchases and sales by dividing the value of all securities, determined by a method as
set forth in the prospectus for each HighMark portfolio, and other assets belonging to each of the portfolios, less
the liabilities charged to each portfolio, by the number of each portfolio's outstanding shares.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Purchases and sales of shares in any of the Funds by the Plans may also occur in connection with daily automated cash
``sweep'' arrangements. However, agreement to such arrangement is not a condition for the Plan otherwise choosing
to invest in shares of the Fund, nor will the reverse be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that at the time the application was filed, all of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate
in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark. Further, it is represented that the ``sweep'' procedures,
as described below with respect to HighMark, will remain in effect under the proposed exemption for any of the Funds.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, a Plan may participate in the ``sweep'' program only with the initial
written approval of the Second Fiduciary and only after certain disclosures have been provided by the Bank. If such
approval is given, cash balances of the Plan held from time to time thereafter pending other investment or distribution
are invested automatically in shares of one or more of HighMark's Money Market Portfolios selected by the Second Fiduciary
on behalf of a Plan at the time of the initial authorization. It is represented that the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement
would not involve shares of HighMark's Non-Money Market Portfolios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the Money Market Portfolios have been selected by the Second Fiduciary on behalf of the Plan, otherwise uninvested
cash down to the last $1.00 balance of the Plans may be invested automatically on a nightly basis. It is represented
that the Bank has no discretion with respect to the timing of the ``sweep'' either into or out of HighMark. Under the
automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement, the Bank's computerized cash management system automatically scans the
accounts of the Plans, as of the end of each business day to determine whether such accounts have positive or negative
net cash balances. Based on this information the system automatically invests the cash of the Plans having positive
balances in shares of the selected Money Market Portfolios. In the case of a Plan having a negative cash balance, the
system automatically liquidates HighMark shares as necessary to eliminate such negative balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that Plans may terminate their participation in the automated cash ``sweep'' arrangement and withdraw
at any time by notifying the Bank. Such termination will be affected by the Bank selling the shares of HighMark held
by the Plan requesting termination within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery,
facsimile, or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written
notice of termination. However, if due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plan
cannot be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is represented that no fee, charge, or penalty of any kind is charged in connections with a termination by a Plan of
participation in the automated cash ``sweep arrangement'' in HighMark or in any of the Funds. It is further represented
that the Bank does not charge separate or additional fees to Plans in order to participate in the daily automated cash
``sweep'' arrangement, nor is such additional compensation contemplated by the proposed exemption.

The Department in a letter, dated August 1, 1986, to Robert S. Plotkin, Assistant Director, Division of Banking Supervision
and Regulation, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, addressed the application of section 408(b)(2)
of the Act to arrangements involving ``sweep services.'' In that letter the Department set forth several examples
to illustrate various circumstances under which violations of section 406(b) of the Act would arise with respect
to such arrangements. Conversely, the letter provided that, if a bank provides ``sweep'' services without the receipt
of additional compensation or other consideration (other than reimbursement of direct expenses properly and actually
incurred in the performance of such services), then the provision of ``sweep'' services by the bank would not, in itself,
constitute a violation of section 406(b) of the Act. Moreover, including ``sweep'' services under a single fee arrangement
for investment management services which is calculated as a percentage of the market value of the total assets under
management would not, in itself, constitute an act described in section 406(b)(1), because the bank would not be exercising
its fiduciary authority or control to cause a plan to pay an additional fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the letter also discusses the applicability of the statutory exemptions under section 408(b)(6) fees
for ``ancillary services'' and under section 408(b)(8) for collective trust funds maintained by such bank of the
Act to such ``sweep'' service arrangements.

15. In summary, the Bank represents that the proposed transactions meet the statutory criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Neither the Plans nor the CIFs have paid or will pay sales commissions or redemption fees in connection with the
in-kind transfer of assets to the Funds in exchange for shares of the Funds or in connection with purchases or sales
by the Plans of shares of the Funds, including purchases and sales handled through daily automated cash ``sweep''
arrangements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Plans or the CIFs have received and will receive shares of the Funds that are equal in value to the assets of the
Plans or the CIFs exchanged for such shares, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at
the close of business on the same day in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Not later than thirty (30) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets in exchange for share of the
Funds, the Second Fiduciaries for affected Plans have received and will receive written confirmation of the assets
involved in the exchange, the price of such assets, and the identity of the pricing service or market maker consulted;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) For all conversion transactions that occur after the date of this proposed exemption, the Bank, no later than ninety
(90) days after completion of each in-kind transfer of assets of the Plans or the CIFs in exchange for shares of the Funds,
will mail to the Second Fiduciary a written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by each affected Plan immediately
before the conversion (and the related per unit value or the aggregate dollar value of the units transferred), and
the number of shares in the Funds that are held by each affected Plan following the conversion (and the related per share
net asset value or the aggregate dollar value of the shares received); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The price that has been or will be paid or received by the Plans for shares in the Funds is the net asset value per share
at the time of the transaction and is the same price for the shares which would have been paid or received by any other
investor at that time; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The Bank, its affiliates, and officers or directors have not and will not purchase from or sell to any of the Plans
shares of any of the Funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The combined total of all fees received by the Bank for the provision of services to the Plans, and in connection
with the provision of services to any of the Funds in which the Plans may invest, has not been and will not be in excess
of ``reasonable compensation'' within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) The Bank has not and will not receive any 12b-1 Fees in connection with the transactions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Prior to investment by a Plan in any of the Funds, in connection with transactions, the Second Fiduciary has received
and will receive a full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning such Fund; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) subsequent to the investment by a Plan in any of the Funds, the Bank will provide the Second Fiduciary of such Plan,
among other information, at least annually with an updated copy of the prospectus for each of the Funds in which the
Plan invests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) in the event such Fund places brokerage transactions with the Bank, the Bank will provide the Second Fiduciary
of such Plan at least annually with a statement specifying the total, expressed in dollars, of brokerage commissions
of each Fund's investment portfolio that are paid by such Fund to the Bank and to unrelated brokerage firms and the average
brokerage commissions per share, expressed as cents per share, by each portfolio of a Fund paid to the Bank and to brokerage
firms unrelated to the Bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (l) On the basis of the disclosures, the Second Fiduciary has authorized and will authorize the transactions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) The authorization by the Second Fiduciary has been and will be terminable at will without penalty to such Plans,
and has been and will be effected within one business day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery,
facsimile, or other available means at the option of the Second Fiduciary, of the Termination Form or any other written
notice of termination, unless circumstances beyond the control of the Bank delay execution for no more than one additional

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) The Plans do not pay any investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees to the Bank with respect to
any of the assets of such Plans which are invested in shares of any of the Funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) the Second Fiduciary has received and will receive a written notice accompanied by a Termination Form with instructions
regarding the use of such form, at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of any increase in the rate
of any fees for investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees, any additional Secondary Service for
which a fee is charged, or any increase in fees for Secondary Services that the Bank provides to the Funds; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(p) All dealings between the Plans and any of the Funds have been and will on a basis no less favorable to such Plans than
dealings between the Funds and other shareholders holding the same class of shares as the Plans.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those persons who may be interested in the pendency of the requested exemption include the fiduciaries of Plans which
have invested, as of the effective date of this exemption, in HighMark and/or in any of the Funds, where the Bank served
as investment adviser to such Funds and also served in any capacity as fiduciary for such Plans. In addition, it is represented
that many other Plans for which the Bank serves in any capacity as a fiduciary may from time to time invest in HighMark
and/or in any of the Funds to which the Bank may serve as investment adviser in the future. For this reason, the Bank does
not know the number of Plans which may therefore be affected by this proposed exemption. Accordingly, the Department
has determined that the only practical form of providing notice to interested persons is the distribution by the Bank
by first class mail of a copy of the notice of pendency of this proposed exemption (the Notice) within thirty (30) days
of the date of the publication of such Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, plus a copy of the supplemental statement, as required, pursuant to 29 CFR 2570.43(b)(2), which shall inform such
interested persons of their right to comment and to request a hearing. The Bank also represents that it will provide
a copy of the proposed exemption and/or a copy of the final exemption, if granted, to any Second Fiduciary of a Plan upon
request.

The Department is considering granting an exemption under the authority of section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code and in accordance with the procedures set forth in 29 CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August

Section I_Exemption for In-Kind Transfer of CIF Assets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the exemption is granted, the restrictions of section 406(a) and 406(b) of the Act and the sanctions resulting from
the application of section 4975 of the Code, by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(A) through (F) of the Code, shall not apply,
as of November 20, 1992, to the in-kind transfer of assets of plans for which Marshall &amp; Ilsley Trust Company or
an affiliate (collectively, M&amp;I) serves as a fiduciary (the Client Plans), other than plans established and
maintained by M&amp;I, that are held in certain collective investment funds maintained by M&amp;I (the CIFs), in
exchange for shares of the Marshall Funds, Inc. (the Funds), an open-end investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), for which M&amp;I acts as investment adviser, custodian, and/or shareholder
servicing agent, in connection with the termination of such CIFs, provided that the following conditions and the
general conditions of Section III below are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) No sales commissions or other fees are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase of Fund shares through
the in-kind transfer of CIF assets and no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of such shares by the Client
Plans to the Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund which have a total net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client
Plan's pro rata share of the assets of the CIF on the date of the transfer, based on the current market value of the CIF's
assets, as determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner at the close of the same business day, using
independent sources in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b) of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1940 Act
and the procedures established by the Funds for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures must require that all
securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions
reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest current independent
bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF
transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing
services independent of M&amp;I.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The combined total of all fees received by M&amp;I for the provision of services to a Client Plan, and in connection

1. Marshall &amp; Ilsley Trust Company (M&amp;I Trust) is a Wisconsin corporation with its principal offices located
at 770 North Water Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and is a subsidiary of Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corporation (M&amp;I
Corp.), a bank holding company. M&amp;I Corp. and various affiliates (referred to herein as ``M&amp;I''), serve
as trustee, directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian for approximately 1,163 employee benefit plans.
As of September 30, 1992, M&amp;I had total assets of approximately $25.3 million and total assets under management
of approximately $4.86 billion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M&amp;I represents that its status as a fiduciary with investment discretion for a Client Plan arises out of its relationship
as a trustee or investment manager for such Plan, but does not result from the rendering of any investment advice to
a Plan fiduciary that has investment discretion for the Client Plan. As a custodian or directed trustee of a Client
Plan, M&amp;I has custody of Plan assets, collects all income, performs bookkeeping and accounting services, generates
periodic statements of account activity and other reports, and makes payments or distributions from the account
as directed. However, M&amp;I has no duty as custodian or directed trustee to review investments or make recommendations,
acting only as directed by an authorized Second Fiduciary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Client Plans include various pension, profit sharing, and stock bonus plans as well as voluntary employees' beneficiary
associations, supplemental unemployment benefit plans, simplified employee benefit plans, retirement plans
for self-employed individuals (i.e., Keogh plans), and individual retirement accounts (IRAs).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

 M&amp;I also requests an exemption for the receipt of fees from the Funds in connection with the investment of assets
of a Client Plan (including any assets of a Client Plan which were held in a terminating CIF) for which it acts as a trustee,
directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian, in shares of the Funds in instances where M&amp;I is an investment
adviser, custodian, and shareholder servicing agent for the Funds. The exemption would include Client Plans for
which M&amp;I exercises investment discretion as well as Client Plans where investment decisions are directed by
a Second Fiduciary.

M&amp;I is not requesting an exemption for any investment in the Funds by the M&amp;I Plans. M&amp;I represents that
the M&amp;I Plans may acquire or sell shares of the Funds pursuant to Prohibited Transaction Exemption 77&hyph;3
(PTE 77&hyph;3, 42 FR 18734, April 8, 1977). PTE 77&hyph;3 permits the acquisition or sale of shares of a registered,
open-end investment company by an employee benefit plan covering only employees of such investment company, employees
of the investment adviser or principal underwriter for such investment company, or employees of any affiliated person
(as defined therein) of such investment adviser or principal underwriter, provided certain conditions are met.
The Department is expressing no opinion in this proposed exemption regarding whether any transactions with the Funds
by the M&amp;I Plans would be covered by PTE 77&hyph;3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Client Plans' pro rata share of fees paid by the Funds to M&amp;I for investment advisory services are credited
to the Client Plans, in accordance with the conditions of the proposed exemption (as discussed in Item 7 below), with
respect to the assets of the Client Plans involved in Fund investments. Any amounts received by M&amp;I for serving
as a custodian and shareholder servicing agent of the Funds are also currently credited to the Client Plans to the extent
that such amounts exceed M&amp;I's direct expenses for providing the service to the Funds. However, M&amp;I proposes
to retain such fees in the future. All investments in the Funds are made by M&amp;I pursuant to an initial written authorization
and an annual reauthorization of the investment by the Second Fiduciary. M&amp;I invests assets of a Client Plan in
any of the Funds for which it has received prior written authorization for such investment from the Second Fiduciary
during the period that the authorization is effective.

3. The Funds are a Wisconsin corporation organized as an open-end investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Funds currently consist of five Funds or ``portfolios'', each having a separate prospectus and representing
a distinct investment vehicle. The shares of each Fund represent a proportionate interest in the assets of that Fund.
The existing Funds include the Marshall Money Market Fund, the Marshall Government Income Fund, the Marshall Intermediate
Bond Fund, the Marshall Short-Term Income Fund, and the Marshall Stock Fund. M&amp;I states that additional Funds
may be established in the future. Shares of the Funds are offered and sold to eligible investors. Certain shares, identified
by each prospectus as Trust Shares, are offered to trust accounts of M&amp;I as a means of acquiring an interest in a
diversified porfolio of investments. M&amp;I states that the Trust Shares are offered to M&amp;I's trust customers,
including the Client Plans, under terms and conditions which are at least as favorable to such customers as the terms
and conditions involved in any other class of Fund shares. If the proposed exemption is granted, the exemption would
cover only investments by Client Plans in Trust Shares. Thus, all references herein to the transactions involving
the Client Plans refer only to the Trust Shares described by the prospectus for each Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments of Client Plan assets in the Funds occur either through a transfer of assets from a terminating CIF, the
direct purchase of shares of the Funds for a Client Plan by M&amp;I, the transfer by M&amp;I of Client Plan assets from
one Fund to another Fund, or a daily automated sweep of uninvested cash of a Client Plan by M&amp;I into one or more Funds
previously designated by the Client Plan for sweeping such cash.

 There are no fees for distribution expenses, pursuant to Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, paid to FSC with respect
to the Trust Shares. In addition, M&amp;I does not and will not receive fees payable pursuant to Rule 12b&hyph;1 in
connection with transactions involving any shares of the Funds. The Trust Shares are charged for certain administrative
expenses of the Funds. FSC is a subsidiary of Federated Investors (Federated) which, through other subsidiaries,
acts as the transfer and dividend disbursing agent for the Funds and provides certain personnel and administrative
services for the Funds. Federated and its subsidiaries are unrelated to M&amp;I. However, M&amp;I Trust is the custodian
for the securities and cash of the Funds and Marshall Funds Investor Services (MFIS), another affiliate of M&amp;I
Corp., is the shareholder servicing agent for the Funds.

According to the Fund prospectuses, investors may purchase shares of the Funds through M&amp;I Brokerage Services,
Inc. (M&amp;I Brokerage Services), an affiliate of M&amp;I Corp. However, the involvement of M&amp;I Brokerage
Services in selling Fund shares is limited to transactions through M&amp;I ``retail'' accounts_i.e., accounts
other than those accounts handled by M&amp;I Trust or other M&amp;I affiliated trust companies. M&amp;I represents
that purchases and sales of Fund shares for all M&amp;I trust accounts, including the Client Plans, are handled by
M&amp;I trust officers dealing directly with Federated, the Funds' distributor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, M&amp;I Brokerage Services does not provide portfolio execution services for the Funds. M&amp;I states
that securities transactions for a Fund's portfolio are executed by broker-dealers unrelated to M&amp;I and do not
generate commissions or other fees to M&amp;I Brokerage Services or any affiliate. The Department notes that for
purposes of this exemption the term ``secondary service'' does not include any brokerage services provided to the
Funds by M&amp;I for the execution of securities transactions engaged in by the Funds (see Section IV(h) above).

5. M&amp;I Investment Management Corp. (M&amp;I Management), a wholly-owned subsidiary of M&amp;I Corp., serves
as the investment adviser for the Funds pursuant to investment advisory agreements with the Funds (the Agreements)
which allow M&amp;I Management to receive monthly investment advisory fees based on a percentage of the average daily
net assets of each of the Funds. The Agreements and the fees received by M&amp;I Management are approved by the Board
of Directors of the Funds (the Funds' Directors), in accordance with the applicable provisions of the 1940 Act. Any
changes in the fees are approved by the Funds' Directors. All of the Funds' Directors are independent of M&amp;I.

6. Prior to November 20, 1992, M&amp;I generally invested assets of Client Plans for which it acted as a trustee with
investment discretion in a series of CIFs. In addition, certain Client Plans where investment decisions are directed
by a Second Fiduciary generally used an M&amp;I CIF as an investment option for individual accounts in the Client Plans.
However, on Friday, November 20, 1992, M&amp;I terminated three of its CIFs_the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Money Market
Fund, the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Bond Fund, and the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund. The assets in these CIFs
were transferred to the Marshall Money Market Fund, the Marshall Intermediate Bond Fund, and the Marshall Stock Fund,
respectively. Each CIF transferred its assets to the corresponding Fund in exchange for Trust Shares of that Fund
at the then current market value of the CIF assets, in accordance with Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the 1940 Act (as discussed
below).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
17
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CIFs were liquidated and the Trust Shares were distributed to the Client Plans, subject to the prior written consent
of the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. Any Client Plan that had not provided prior written approval for the transfer
of its CIF assets to the Funds, by the deadline set for such approvals, received a cash distribution of its pro rata share
of the CIF assets no later than Friday, November 20, 1992, preceding the transfers.

Rule 17a&hyph;7 permits transactions between investment funds that use the same investment adviser, subject to
certain conditions. Rule 17a&hyph;7 requires, among other things, that such transactions be effected at the ``independent
current market price'' for each security, involve only securities for which market quotations are readily available,
involve no brokerage commissions or other remuneration, and comply with valuation procedures adopted by the board
of directors of the investment company to ensure that all requirements of the Rule are satisfied.

The assets of the CIFs were reviewed by M&amp;I Management as investment adviser to the Funds, in coordination with
Federated Administrative Services (FAS), the Funds' third party administrator, to determine that the assets were
appropriate investments for the corresponding Funds. FAS created a portfolio accounting system to track the securities
to be acquired by the Funds. Prior to the transfer of CIF assets to the Funds, the Funds did not hold any securities or
other assets except cash or, as in the case of the Marshall Money Market Fund, U.S. Treasury Bills.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transfer transactions occurred using market values as of the close of business on Friday, November 20, 1992. The
securities transferred from the CIFs were the same as the securities received by the Funds. The applicant states that
the value of the securities was determined in a single valuation by M&amp;I as investment adviser for the Funds, in
accordance with the requirement of Rule 17a-7(b) that transactions be effected at the ``independent current market
price'' of the securities. The valuation of the securities was performed in the same manner for both the CIF and the
corresponding Fund at the close of the same business day. Specifically, as required by the Rule, securities listed
on exchanges were valued at their closing prices on Friday, November 20, and unlisted securities were valued based
on the average of bid and ask quotations at the close of the market on Friday, November 20, obtained from three brokers
independent of M&amp;I. Any fees charged by the independent brokers for the bid and ask prices were paid by M&amp;I.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Client Plan that approved the CIF asset transfers to the Funds received account statements describing the asset
transfers either in mid-December 1992, if such Plans were on a monthly account statement schedule, or mid-January
1993, if such Plans were on a quarterly account statement schedule. The statements showed the disposition of the CIF
units from the Client Plan account and the acquisition by the account of Fund shares, both posted as of Monday, November
23, 1992.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 This information provided the affected Client Plans with written confirmation of the number of CIF units held by the
Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value and the total dollar amount of such CIF units
as well as the number of shares of the Funds held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net
asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares.

The applicant has provided the following example: Assume a Client Plan held 12,506 units of the M&amp;I Employee Benefit
Stock Fund prior to the asset transfers. The account statement showed a disposition of 12,506 units of M&amp;I Employee
Benefit Stock Fund, at a value of $72.08 per unit, on November 23, 1992, with total proceeds of $901,432.18. The statement
also showed a purchase on that same date of 90,143.218 shares of the Marshall Stock Fund, the Fund corresponding to
the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund, at $10 per share, at a total cost of $901,432.18, the same amount as the proceeds
of the disposition from the M&amp;I Employee Benefit Stock Fund.

Thus, the applicant represents that as of November 23, 1992, Client Plans that were formerly invested in the terminated
CIFs held Trust Shares of the corresponding Funds which were of the same value, based on the Client Plans' pro rata share
of the underlying market value of the securities transferred to the Funds, as their assets in the CIF as of the close
of business on Friday, November 20, 1992. M&amp;I represents that the other CIFs may be terminated in the future and
that all such terminations and subsequent transfers of CIF assets for Trust Shares of the Funds will comply with Rule
17a-7 as described above and the conditions of this proposed exemption.

, M&amp;I will send by regular mail to each affected Client Plan a written confirmation, not later than 30 days after
completion of the transaction, containing the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The identity of each security that was valued for purposes of the transaction in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The price of each such security involved in the transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Securities which are valued in accordance with Rule 17a-7(b)(4) are securities for which the current market price
cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange
or the NASDAQ system. M&amp;I states that such securities are valued based on an average of the highest current independent
bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding the weekend of the CIF
transfers, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that are broker-dealers or pricing
services independent of M&amp;I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, for all in-kind transfers of CIF assets to a Fund that occur after the date this proposed exemption is published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, M&amp;I will send by regular mail to the Second Fiduciary no later than 90 days after completion of each transfer a
written confirmation that contains the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The number of CIF units held by the Client Plan immediately before the transfer, the related per unit value, and
the total dollar amount of such CIF units; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The number of shares in the Funds that are held by the Client Plan following the transfer, the related per share net
asset value, and the total dollar amount of such shares. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M&amp;I believes that the interests of the Client Plans are better served by the collective investment of assets of
the Client Plans in the Funds rather than in the CIFs. The Funds are valued on a daily basis, whereas the majority of the
CIFs are valued monthly. The daily valuation permits: (i) Immediate investment of Client Plan contributions in various
types of investments; (ii) greater flexibility in transferring assets from one type of investment to another; and
(iii) daily redemption of investments for purposes of making distributions. In addition, information concerning
the investment performance of the Funds will be available in newspapers of general circulation which will allow Client
Plan fiduciaries to monitor the performance of investments on a daily basis and make more informed investment decisions.

7. For investments in the Funds on behalf of Client Plans subsequent to the transfer of the CIF assets to the Funds where
the assets involved were not previously invested in any CIFs, M&amp;I currently offsets its investment management
or advisory fees for assets invested in the Funds in accordance with one of the methods for offsetting double investment
advisory fees described in Prohibited Transaction Exemption 77&hyph;4 (PTE 77&hyph;4, 42 FR 18732, April 8, 1977).
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Consequently, the applicant represents that the fee structure for these investments complies with the fee structure
under PTE 77&hyph;4, and that the other conditions of PTE 77&hyph;4 are met.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 However, for Client Plan investments in the Funds with respect to assets that were previously held in the CIFs prior

M&amp;I anticipates using the Fee Structure for future Client Plan investments in the Funds where the assets involved
were not previously invested in the CIFs if the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan elects to use the Fee Structure
in lieu of the offset or credit methods prescribed by PTE 77&hyph;4. M&amp;I states that the Fee Structure preserves
a Client Plan's existing fee rates for investment management services by M&amp;I when such Plan invests in the Funds
or when such Plan's assets are transferred from the CIFs to the Funds. The Fee Structure is described as follows:

PTE 77&hyph;4, in pertinent part, permits the purchase and sale by an employee benefit plan of shares of a registered,
open-end investment company when a fiduciary with respect to the plan is also the investment adviser for the investment
company, provided that, among other things, the plan does not pay an investment management, investment advisory
or similar fee with respect to the plan assets invested in such shares for the entire period of such investment. Section
II(c) of PTE 77&hyph;4 states that this condition does not preclude the payment of investment advisory fees by the
investment company under the terms of an investment advisory agreement adopted in accordance with section 15 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Section II(c) states further that this condition does not preclude payment of an investment
advisory fee by the plan based on total plan assets from which a credit has been subtracted representing the plan's
pro rata share of investment advisory fees paid by the investment company.

(a) M&amp;I charges its standard fees to all the Client Plans for serving as a trustee, directed trustee, investment
manager, or custodian for the Client Plans.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 All fees are billed on a quarterly basis. The annual charges for a Client Plan account are based on fee schedules negotiated
with M&amp;I. For example, if the fee is unbundled, the standard charge by M&amp;I to a Client Plan for serving as a trustee
with solely custodial responsibilities varies from 17.5 basis points for account assets under $5 million to 5 basis
points for account assets over $75 million, subject to a base annual charge of $1,500 and additional charges for specific
services. Where M&amp;I serves as investment manager to a Client Plan account, depending on the type of portfolio,
the charge may vary from 30 basis points up to 80 basis points. This charge is separate from, and would be in addition
to, the fee for custodial services described above. M&amp;I provides services to the Client Plans for which it acts
as a trustee with investment discretion, including sweep services for uninvested cash balances in such Plans, under
a bundled or single fee arrangement which is calculated as a percentage of the market value of the Plan assets under
management. Thus, in such instances, there are no separate charges for the provision of particular services to the
Client Plans. However, for Client Plans where investment decisions are directed by a Second Fiduciary, a separate
charge is assessed for particular services, including sweep services, where the Second Fiduciary specifically
agrees to have M&amp;I provide such services to the Client Plan.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 M&amp;I states that in many cases fees charged by M&amp;I to a Client Plan are paid by the Client Plan sponsor rather
than by the Client Plan.

as the investment advisory fees but only to the extent that these amounts exceed M&amp;I's direct expenses for providing
such services. However, M&amp;I proposes in the future to retain any fees received by M&amp;I from the Funds for custody

accounts, valuing plan assets, conducting non-discrimination testing, preparing Forms 5500 and other required
filings, and producing statements and reports regarding overall plan and individual participant holdings. These
trustee services are necessary regardless of whether the Client Plan's assets are invested in the Funds. Thus, M&amp;I
represents that its proposed receipt of fees for both secondary services at the Fund-level and trustee services at
the Plan-level would not involve the receipt of ``double fees'' for duplicative services to the Client Plans because
a Fund is charged for custody and other services relative to the individual securities owned by the Fund, while a Client
Plan is charged for the maintenance of Plan accounts reflecting ownership of the Fund shares and other assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, the Department notes that the combined total of all fees received by M&amp;I directly and indirectly
from the Client Plans for the provision of services to the Plans and/or to the Funds should not be in excess of ``reasonable
compensation'' within the meaning of section 408(b)(2) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the fact that certain transactions and fee arrangements are the subject of an administrative exemption
does not relieve a Client Plan fiduciary from the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the
Act. Thus, the Department cautions the fiduciaries of the Client Plans investing in the Funds that they have an ongoing
duty under section 404 of the Act to monitor the services provided to the Client Plans to assure that the fees paid by
the Client Plans for such services are reasonable in relation to the value of the services provided. Such responsibilities
would include determinations that the services provided are not duplicative and that the fees are reasonable in light
of the level of services provided.

M&amp;I represents that the credited fees are currently paid to the Client Plan only in cash, but that the credits may
be effectuated in the future through the purchase of additional shares of the Funds pursuant to an annual election
made by the Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. The purchase of the shares will occur in lieu of a cash credit on the
same day that such credit would have been paid to the Client Plan. M&amp;I states that the fee credits were initially
made in cash to the Client Plans so that no authorizations for crediting fees in the form of additional shares of the
Funds would be involved at the time of the transfers of the CIF assets to the Funds. All decisions regarding the use of
the credited fees to purchase additional shares of the Funds, including annual reauthorizations for such credits,
will be made by a Second Fiduciary for the Client Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Credit Program ensures that M&amp;I does not receive any additional investment management, advisory or similar
fees from the Funds as a result of investments in the Funds by the Client Plans. Thus, M&amp;I represents that the Fee
Structure is at least as advantageous to the Client Plans as an arrangement pursuant to the conditions of PTE 77&hyph;4
whereby investment advisory fees paid by the Funds to M&amp;I Management would be offset or credited against investment
management fees charged directly by M&amp;I to the Client Plans. In this regard, M&amp;I states that the Credit Program
essentially has the same effect in offsetting M&amp;I Management's investment advisory fees as an arrangement under
PTE 77&hyph;4, section II(c), allowing for a credit by subtracting the amount of such fees from the investment management
fees charged directly by M&amp;I to the Client Plans (the Subtraction Method). M&amp;I states further that in many
instances the Credit Program is more advantageous to a Client Plan than an arrangement using the Subtraction Method
because under the Credit Program a Client Plan receives a credit in either cash or shares on the same day (or within one
business day after) the fees are received by M&amp;I Management from the Funds. However, under the Subtraction Method,
a Client Plan would not receive a credit on the same day (or within one business day after) the fees are paid to M&amp;I
Management from the Funds if the billing period for services to the Funds is different than the billing period for M&amp;I's
fiduciary services to the Client Plan. The Fee Structure with the Credit Program allows M&amp;I to maintain a fixed
fiduciary fee schedule for services to the Client Plans without any adjustments in billing for such services, as required
under the Subtraction Method. M&amp;I notes that the Fee Structure also allows the Client Plan sponsor the option
to pay the Client Plan's fees to M&amp;I for serving as a trustee, directed trustee, investment manager, or custodian
and have the Client Plan receive a credit of the Plan's pro rata share of the investment advisory fees paid to M&amp;I.

To the extent that the Department of the Treasury determines that this arrangement should be deemed a contribution

M&amp;I is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls for the Credit
Program. In addition, M&amp;I has retained the services of Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. of Milwaukee, Wisconsin (the
Auditor), an independent accounting firm, to audit annually the crediting of fees to the Client Plans under the Credit
Program. M&amp;I states that such audits provide independent verification of the proper crediting to the Client
Plans of fees charged by M&amp;I to the Funds. M&amp;I states further that information obtained from the audits is
used in the preparation of required financial disclosure reports to the Client Plans' fiduciaries.

By letter dated November 6, 1992, the Auditor describes the procedures that are used in the annual audit of the Credit
Program. The Auditor obtains: (i) A calculation of the daily actual balances for all the Funds and for the total Client
Plan shareholders of such Funds; (ii) a detailed list of the expenses charged to the Funds' shareholders by type of
expense; and (iii) calculations of the total expenses charged by M&amp;I to each Fund which are reimbursable to the
Client Plans. On the basis of such information, the Auditor: (i) Reviews and tests compliance with the Credit Program's
operational controls and procedures established by M&amp;I; (ii) verifies the daily credit factors transmitted
to M&amp;I from the Funds, including the proper assignment of identification numbers to all Client Plan shareholders;
and (iii) verifies the credits paid in total to the sum of all credits paid to each Client Plan. The Auditor recomputes,
in total, the cash received in connection with the credit of each Client Plan's expenses to ensure that the proper amount
of cash was issued to the Client Plan. Finally, the Auditor recomputes on a test basis the amount of credits received
by selected Client Plan shareholders of the Funds to verify that such credits were properly made. In this regard, the
Auditor obtains a listing of the credits paid to each Client Plan regarding its shares in each of the Funds to determine
that the total credit paid to the Client Plan by M&amp;I equals the total amount that was required to be credited. At
such time as M&amp;I offers Client Plans the option to have the fees credited as additional Fund shares, the Auditor
will also recompute the number of Fund shares issued to the Client Plans to ensure that each Client Plan received the
proper number of shares. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event either the internal audit by M&amp;I or the independent audit by the Auditor identifies that an error has
been made in the crediting of fees to the Client Plans, M&amp;I will correct the error. With respect to any shortfall
in credited fees to a Client Plan involving cash credits, M&amp;I will make a cash payment to the Client Plan equal to
the amount of the error plus interest paid at money market rates offered by M&amp;I for the period involved. With respect
to a shortfall in credited fees involving a Client Plan where the Second Fiduciary's election is to have credited fees
invested in shares of a particular Fund, M&amp;I will make a cash payment equal to at least the amount of the error plus
interest based on the greater of either: (i) The money market rates offered by M&amp;I for the period involved, or (ii)
the total rate of return for shares of the Fund that would have been acquired during such period. Any excess credits
made to a Client Plan will be corrected by an appropriate deduction and reallocation of cash during the next payment
period to reflect accurately the amount of total credits due to the Client Plan for the period involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. With respect to any transfer of a Client Plan's CIF assets to a Fund, M&amp;I states that a Second Fiduciary for the
Client Plan receives advance written notice of the in-kind transfer of assets of the CIFs and full written disclosure
of information concerning the Fund. On the basis of such information, the Second Fiduciary authorizes in writing
the in-kind transfer of the Client Plan's CIF assets to a Fund in exchange for shares of the Fund. With respect to the
receipt of fees by M&amp;I from a Fund in connection with any Client Plan's investment in the Fund, M&amp;I states that
a Second Fiduciary receives full and detailed written disclosure of information concerning the Fund in advance of
any investment by the Client Plan in the Fund. On the basis of such information, the Second Fiduciary authorizes in
writing the investment of assets of the Client Plan in the Fund and the fees to be paid by the Fund to M&amp;I. Such authorization
will include in the future an election for the Second Fiduciary to purchase additional shares of the Fund with the fees
credited to the Client Plan by M&amp;I. In addition, M&amp;I represents that the Second Fiduciary of each Client Plan
invested in a particular Fund will receive full written disclosure, in a statement separate from the Fund prospectus,
of any proposed increases in the rates of fees charged by M&amp;I to the Funds for secondary services which are above
the rate reflected in the prospectus for the Fund, at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such increase. The
Second Fiduciary will also receive full written disclosure in a Fund prospectus or otherwise of any increases in the
rate of fees charged by M&amp;I to the Funds for investment advisory services even though such fees will be credited,
as required by Section II(d) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any authorizations by a Second Fiduciary regarding the investment of a Client Plan's assets in a Fund and the fees to
be paid to M&amp;I, including any future increases in rates of fees for secondary services, are or will be terminable
at will by the Second Fiduciary, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&amp;I of written notice of termination.
A Termination Form expressly providing an election to terminate the authorization with instructions on the use of
the form is supplied to the Second Fiduciary no less than annually. The instructions for the Termination Form include
the following information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The authorization is terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty to the Client Plan, upon receipt by
M&amp;I of written notice from the Second Fiduciary; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Failure to return the form will result in continued authorization of M&amp;I to engage in the subject transactions
on behalf of the Client Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M&amp;I states that the Termination Form may be used at will by the Second Fiduciary to terminate an authorization
without penalty to the Client Plan and to notify M&amp;I in writing to effect a termination by selling the shares of
the Funds held by the Client Plan requesting such termination within one business day following receipt by M&amp;I
of the form; provided that if, due to circumstances beyond the control of M&amp;I, the sale cannot be executed within
one business day, M&amp;I shall have one additional business day to complete such sale.

Any disclosure of information regarding a proposed increase in the rate of any fees for secondary services will be
accompanied by an additional Termination Form with instructions on the use of the form as described above. Therefore,
the Second Fiduciary will have prior notice of the proposed increase and an opportunity to withdraw from the Funds
in advance of the date the increase becomes effective. Although the Second Fiduciary will also have notice of any increase
in the rates of fees charged by M&amp;I to the Funds for investment advisory services, through an updated prospectus
or otherwise, such notice will not be accompanied by an additional Termination Form since all increases in investment
advisory fees will be credited by M&amp;I to the Client Plans and will be subject to an annual reauthorization as described
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
M&amp;I states that the Second Fiduciary always receives a current prospectus for each Fund and a written statement
giving full disclosure of the Fee Structure prior to any investment in the Funds. The disclosure statement explains
why M&amp;I believes that the investment of assets of the Client Plan in the Funds is appropriate. The disclosure statement
also describes whether there are any limitations on M&amp;I with respect to which Client Plan assets may be invested
in shares of the Funds and, if so, the nature of such limitations.

See section II(d) of PTE 77&hyph;4 which requires, in pertinent part, that an independent plan fiduciary receive
a current prospectus issued by the investment company and a full and detailed written disclosure of the investment
advisory and other fees charged to or paid by the plan and the investment company, including a discussion of whether
there are any limitations on the fiduciary/investment adviser with respect to which plan assets may be invested in
shares of the investment company and, if so, the nature of such limitations.

M&amp;I states further that the Second Fiduciary receives an updated prospectus for each Fund at least annually and
either annual or semi-annual reports for each Fund. M&amp;I provides monthly reports to the Second Fiduciary of all
transactions engaged in by the Client Plan, including purchases and sales of Fund shares. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. No sales commissions are paid by the Client Plans in connection with the purchase or sale of shares of the Funds. In
addition, no redemption fees are paid in connection with the sale of shares by the Client Plans to the Funds. The applicant
states that all other dealings between the Client Plans and the Funds, M&amp;I Management or any affiliate, are on
a basis no less favorable to the Client Plans than such dealings are with the other shareholders of the Funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In summary, M&amp;I represents that the transactions described herein satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (a) The Funds provide the Client Plans with a more effective investment vehicle than the
CIFs maintained by M&amp;I without any increase in investment management, advisory or similar fees paid to M&amp;I;
(b) with respect to the transfer of a Client Plan's CIF assets into a Fund in exchange for Fund shares, a Second Fiduciary
authorizes in writing such transfer prior to the transaction only after full written disclosure of information concerning
the Fund; (c) each Client Plan receives shares of a Fund in connection with the transfer of assets of a terminating CIF
which have a net asset value that is equal to the value of the Client Plan's pro rata share of the CIF assets on the date
of the transfer, based on the current market value of such assets as determined in a single valuation at the close of
the same business day using independent sources in accordance with procedures established by the Fund which comply
with Rule 17a-7 of the 1940 Act; (d) with respect to any investments in a Fund by the Client Plans and the payment of any
fees by the Fund to M&amp;I, a Second Fiduciary receives full written disclosure of information concerning the Fund,
including a current prospectus and a statement describing the Fee Structure, and authorizes in writing the investment
of the Client Plan's assets in the particular Fund and the fees paid by such Fund to M&amp;I; (e) any authorizations
made by a Client Plan regarding investments in a Fund and fees paid to M&amp;I, or any increases in the rates of fees for
secondary services which are retained by M&amp;I, are or will be terminable at will by the Client Plan, without penalty
to the Client Plan, upon receipt by M&amp;I of written notice of termination from the Second Fiduciary; (f) M&amp;I
requires annual audits by an independent accounting firm to verify the proper crediting to the Client Plans of fees
charged by M&amp;I to the Funds; (g) no commissions or redemption fees are paid by the Client Plan in connection with
either the acquisition of Fund shares, through either a direct purchase of the shares or a transfer of CIF assets in
exchange for the shares, or the sale of Fund shares; and (h) all dealings between the Client Plans, the Funds and M&amp;I,
are on a basis which is at least as favorable to the Client Plans as such dealings are with other shareholders of the Funds.

Corporation (the Employer), a party in interest with respect to the Plan, provided that the following conditions
are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The fair market value of the Property is established by a real estate appraiser independent of the Plan and the Employer;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Employer pays the greater of $115,000 or the current fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements)
with the enhancement value for an adjoining owner as of the date of sale; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The sale is a one-time transaction for cash; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan pays no fees or commissions in regard to the sale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Summary of Facts and Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Employer is a metal stampings manufacturing concern with offices in Mt. Joy and Hellam Township, Pennsylvania.
The Plan is a defined benefit plan which had approximately 66 participants and total assets of approximately $1,083,139
as of the time of filing of the exemption application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Plan purchased the Property in April 1978 from unrelated parties for a purchase price of $22,689 in cash. The
Property is a vacant lot of about 2.51 acres located in Hellam Township adjacent to property of the Employer. The adjacent
property includes a one-story manufacturing and warehouse complex utilized by the Employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost to the Plan of acquiring and holding the Property since the time of purchase has been only the original
purchase price. All taxes and other costs related to the holding of the Property by the Plan have been paid by the Employer.
A small portion of the lot was recently paved at the expense of the Employer to provide an additional parking opportunity
to the Employer, and certain other improvements to the Property (including storm sewer installation and driveway
access) have been financed by the Employer. The Employer has expended a total of $72,260, including taxes, on the Property
since the time it was acquired by the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The applicant obtained an appraisal on the Property dated April 14, 1994, from B. Daniel Wagner, MAI (Wagner) of
Associated Appraisers in York, Pennsylvania. The applicant represents that Wagner is independent of the Plan and
the Employer. Wagner states that he is aware that the Employer is the owner of contiguous property and is the prospective
buyer of the Property. In Wagner's opinion, the fair market value of the Property (excluding site improvements which
were constructed at the expense of the Employer) to an adjoining owner and including the enhancement value for such
adjoining owner was $115,000 as of the date of the appraisal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan now proposes to sell the Property to the Employer. The Employer will pay the greater of the current fair market
value of the Property (excluding site improvements) for an adjoining owner, based on an updated independent appraisal,
or the total amount the Plan has expended on the Property as of the date of sale. The sale of the Property will be entirely
for cash, and the Plan will pay no fees or commissions in regard to the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant represents that portion of the Property which was paved for parking has been utilized by employees of
the Employer. This parking area contains 48 spaces and was completed in October 1993. A supplement to the above described
appraisal, prepared by Wagner on June 20, 1994, estimates the total fair market rental for such usage to be approximately
$350 per month. The Employer will compensate the Plan in that amount for the period of time the Employer has utilized
the parking area from October 1993 to the date of sale of the Property.

The applicant recognizes that the use of a portion of the Property for parking purposes of the Employer may have constituted
prohibited transactions under section 406 of the Act and section 4975 of the Code. Accordingly, the Employer will
pay the Internal Revenue Service any excise taxes that are applicable under section 4975(a) of the Code within 90 days
of the publication in the

5. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria of section
408(a) of the Act because: (1) The fair market value of the Property will be established by a real estate appraiser independent
of the Plan and the Employer; (2) the Employer will pay the greater of the current fair market value of the Property (excluding
site improvements) for an adjoining owner or the total amount the Plan has expended on the Property; (3) the Plan will
pay no fees or commissions in connection with the sale; and (4) the sale of the Property will be an all cash transaction.

General Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

Statutory Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code and the procedures set forth in 29
CFR Part 2570, Subpart B (55 FR 32836, 32847, August 10, 1990) and based upon the entire record, the Department makes
the following findings: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The exemptions are administratively feasible; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) They are in the interests of the plans and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their participants and beneficiaries; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) They are protective of the rights of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants and beneficiaries of the plans.

Batterymarch Financial Management (BFM) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Located in Boston, Massachusetts; Exemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
[Prohibited Transaction Exemption 94&hyph;61; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application No. D&hyph;9230] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The restrictions of section 406(b)(2) of the Act shall not apply to the proposed cross-trading of equity securities
between various accounts managed by BFM (the Accounts) where at least one Account involved in any cross-trade is an
employee benefit plan account (Plan Account) for which BFM acts as a fiduciary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditions and Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This exemption is subject to the following conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. (a) Each Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade program is subject to BFM's receipt of a written authorization
executed in advance by a qualified Plan fiduciary, which is independent of BFM and its Affiliates (the Independent
Fiduciary). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The authorization referred to in paragraph (a) is terminable at will, without penalty to the Plan Account, upon
receipt by BFM of written notice of termination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Before an authorization is made for any Account, an independent account representative, which must be an Independent
Fiduciary in the case of a Plan Account (collectively, an Independent Account Representative) must be furnished
with any reasonable available information necessary for the Independent Account Representative to determine whether
the authorization should be made, including (but not limited to) a copy of the proposed and final exemption issued
by the Department, an explanation of how the authorization may be terminated, a description of BFM's cross-trade
practices, and any other information requested by the Independent Account Representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Each cross-trade transaction must satisfy the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The cross-trade opportunity must be triggered as a result of an Account participating in the program experiencing
a need to sell equity securities arising from one of the following three circumstances: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that all of the assets in the Account be liquidated;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the Independent Account Representative specifically directs that a portion of the Account be liquidated and
the selection of the particular equity securities to be sold is made either by the Independent Account Representative
or by an optimization program used by BFM (the Optimization Program) which operates, pursuant to certain prescribed
objective criteria, to automatically generate an optimal portfolio for such Accounts; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the application of the Optimization Program to the specific investment objectives and restrictions established
by the Independent Account Representative requires the sale of a security which is otherwise ranked by BFM as a buy
or a hold for all relevant Accounts under the Stock Evaluation Process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) With respect to each cross-trade opportunity triggered under paragraph 2(a), the Optimization Program used
by BFM must determine, in the ordinary course of its considering all available equity securities in the applicable
universe, that another Account or Accounts participating in the program should purchase some or all of the available
equity securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The cross-trade transaction must take place within three business days of the ``triggering event'' giving rise
to the cross-trade opportunity described in paragraph 2(a) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The cross-trade transaction must be effected through a broker which is unaffiliated with BFM and its Affiliates.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Independent Account Representative of each Account engaging in a cross-trade transaction must be provided
with a written confirmation of the cross-trade transaction within 10 days after the completion of the transaction.
The confirmation must set forth: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the particular equity securities involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the number of shares involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the price at which the transaction was executed; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) the specific triggering event, identified above in paragraph 2(a), which caused the cross-trade transaction
to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. (a) Each cross-trade must be effected at the closing price for the equity securities involved on the date of the transaction,
as quoted by the exchange on which such securities are principally traded or by the NASDAQ National Market System (NASDAQ).
In the case of domestic equity securities traded over-the-counter, other than those traded on NASDAQ, the price must
be the mean between the closing daily ``bid'' and ``asked'' prices on the date of the transactions, obtained from recognized
independent sources, unless such securities have actually traded within 24 hours of the cross-trade transaction
in which case the price must be the last sale price for the securities. If more than one source is used by BFM to price a
particular domestic equity security traded over-the-counter, then the price must be equal to the average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer obtained from such sources. No foreign equity securities,
other than those traded on a recognized foreign securities exchange for which market quotations are readily available,
shall be cross-traded by the Accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The equity securities involved in the cross-trade are those for which there is a generally recognized market with
adequate pricing information to enable BFM to use the Optimization Program for the Accounts in the transaction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The cross-trade must involve less than 5 percent of the aggregate average daily trading volume of the equity securities
which are the subject of the transaction for the week immediately preceding the completion of the transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. For any cross-trade opportunity where equity securities available for sale from a Selling Account may be sold to
more than one Buying Account, each cross-trade opportunity shall be allocated first to the Buying Account which is
ranked by the Optimization Program as being furthest from optimality, measured on a numerical basis at the time of
the transaction, until such Account is brought up to par with the Account which is next furthest from optimality. Such
Accounts shall then be allocated cross-trade opportunities on a pro rata basis until the Accounts are brought up to
the level of the next Account which is furthest from optimality. This allocation process shall continue until all
cross-trade opportunities involving the equity securities in question are exhausted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. (a) BFM furnishes the Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the cross-trade program at
least once every three months, and not later than 45 days following the period to which it related, a report disclosing:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) a list of all cross-trade transactions engaged in on behalf of the Plan Account during the period; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) with respect to each cross-trade transaction, the actual price used to effect the transaction and the identity
of the pricing source, as well as the highest and lowest reported prices at which the equity securities involved in
the transaction were traded on the date of such transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The authorizing Independent Fiduciary for each Plan Account participating in the program is furnished with a
summary report at least once per year. The summary must be furnished within 45 days after the end of the period to which
it relates, and must contain the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) a description of the total amount of the Plan Account's assets, by type of equity security, involved in cross-trade
transactions during the period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) a description of BFM's cross-trade practices, if such practices have changed materially during the period covered
by the summary; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) a statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of cross-trade transactions may be terminated
upon receipt by BFM of the Independent Fiduciary's written notice to that effect; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) a statement that the Independent Fiduciary's authorization of the Plan Account's participation in the cross-trade
program will continue in effect unless it is terminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The cross-trade transaction does not involve assets of any employee benefit plan established or maintained by
BFM or any of its Affiliates (Batterymarch Plan). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have
total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer
or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if
the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. BFM receives no fee or other compensation (other than its agreed investment management fee) with respect to any
cross-trade transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. BFM is a discretionary investment manager with respect to Plan Accounts participating in the cross-trade program
and does not cause any Plan Account to purchase or sell equity securities with another Account in order to merely track
or replicate the portfolio of an independently maintained third party index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. For purposes of this exemption: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this
exemption, refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on June 21, 1994 at 59 FR 32018. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective Date: This exemption is effective as of June 3, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written Comments: The Department received one written comment and no requests for a hearing. The comment was submitted
on behalf of AT&amp;T (the Applicant) in supplementation of the Summary of Facts and Representations (the Summary)
in the notice of proposed exemption. The points addressed by the Applicant in the comment are summarized as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Paragraph (1) of the Summary indicates that the BellSouth Master Trust hold assets of the BellSouth Plans, which
are sponsored by BellSouth. The Applicant states that it has become aware that one additional plan participates in
the BellSouth Master Trust: the Retirement Plan of Stevens Graphics, Inc., sponsored by Stevens Graphics, Inc.,
an affiliate of BellSouth Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) In paragraph (6) of the Summary, it is stated that with the addition of the Southpark assets, Karsten commenced
to hold under management over 20 percent of the assets of TREET. The Applicant represents that this statement does
not accurately describe Karsten's position with respect to management of TREET assets. The Applicant represents
that with the addition of the Southpark assets, the TREET assets under management by Karsten constituted over twenty
percent of all assets managed by Karsten on behalf of all its clients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the entire record, including the comment, the Department has determined to grant the exemption.

any transactions to which those restrictions or taxes would otherwise apply merely because a person is deemed to be
a party in interest or disqualified person (including a fiduciary) with respect to a plan by virtue of providing services
to the plan (or by virtue of having a relationship to such service provider described in section 3(14) (F), (G), (H),

II. General Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's length transaction with an unrelated party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced by other certificates of the same trust;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

three highest generic rating categories from either Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (S&amp;P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. (D&amp;P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligations (or interests); and the sum of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than
reasonable compensation for the servicer's services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement
of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection therewith; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The plan investing in such certificates is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Neither any underwriter, placement agent, sponsor, trustee, servicer, insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any
of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice with respect to the plan assets used by
a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6)
above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of such certificates, provided that (1) such
condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum; and (2) in the case of a private placement
of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance
with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser to the effect that, so long as such initial
purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates) is required to obtain from its transferee
a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, any such transferees will be required to make
a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection II.A.(6) above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, the National Labor Relations Board is publishing
a notice revising existing routine uses Nos. 1, 3, and 8 in its system of records NLRB&hyph;19, Telephone Call Detail
Records. The system notice of NLRB&hyph;19 was last published in its entirety in 58 FR 50957 on September 29, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As amended, routine use No. 1 will specify that on disclosure to an inquiring congressional office, the subject individual
must be the constituent about whom the records are maintained. The other two amended routine uses Nos. 3 and 8 respectively
will narrow the existing routine uses to specify more exactly the information that may be disclosed to a court or an
adjudicative body in the course of presenting evidence or argument, including disclosure to opposing counsel or
witnesses in the course of civil discovery, and to an inquiring Federal authority for hiring or retention of an employee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A report of this notice to amend the three routine uses in NLRB&hyph;19, Telephone Call Detail Records was filed pursuant
to 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) with the Office of Management and Budget and with Congress. The specific changes to the notice being
amended (58 FR 50957, September 29, 1993) are set forth below.

or argument, including disclosure to opposing counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery, litigation,
or settlement negotiations, or in connection with criminal law proceedings, when: (a) The NLRB or any component thereof;
or (b) any employee of the NLRB in his or her official capacity; or (c) any employee of the NLRB in his or her individual
capacity where the NLRB has agreed to represent the employee; or (d) the United States Government, is a party to litigation
or has interest in such litigation, and determines that such disclosure is relevant and necessary to the litigation
and that the use of such records is therefore deemed by the NLRB to be for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose
for which the records were collected.

hiring or retention of an employee, the issuance or retention of a security clearance, the letting of a contract, or
the issuance or retention of a license, grant, or other benefit. The other agency or licensing organization, however,
may then make a request supported by the written consent of the individual for the entire record if it so chooses. No
disclosure will be made unless the information has been determined to be sufficiently reliable to support a referral
to another office within the NLRB or to another Federal agency for criminal, civil, administrative, personnel, or
regulatory action.

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CHX is adopting Rule 9 to Article XII of the Exchange's Rules to authorize the CHX to provide information to the CRD
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 concerning pending formal Exchange disciplinary proceedings for disclosure to the public. According to the Exchange,
a formal disciplinary proceeding is considered to be pending from the time charges are issued

The CRD is an automated industry database containing employment and disciplinary history of members and associated
persons registered with self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and state securities agencies. The CRD is operated
by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'') with input on policy and other matters from federal
and state agencies and other SROs, including the Exchange.

Information concerning final disciplinary actions taken by the Exchange, the NASD and other self-regulatory and
regulatory organizations, as well as information concerning certain criminal convictions contained in the CRD,
has been disclosed to the public pursuant to the NASD's 800 number service since October 1991. The Commission subsequently
approved the NASD's procedures for operating its 800 number service in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30629
(April 23, 1992), 57 FR 18535 (April 30, 1992) (File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;91&hyph;39) (``800 Number Service Plan
Approved Order''). On July 1, 1993, the SEC approved an NASD rule change to make more information available to the general
public regarding pending disciplinary proceedings or actions taken by federal or state securities agencies and
SROs that relate to securities or commodities transactions, and regarding criminal indictments and information.

Information on pending formal SRO disciplinary proceedings, among other events, is currently in the CRD, but only
to the extent that reports are made by members, member organizations and associated persons pursuant to their reporting
obligations on the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer (Form U&hyph;4) and Form
BD, the uniform application form for broker-dealer registration. The proposal would expand the information available
on pending disciplinary actions by requiring the Exchange to report such cases to the CRD.

In the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Penny Stock Reform Act''), Congress
mandated that the NASD establish a toll-free telephone number (`800 number service'') for the purpose of receiving
and responding to inquiries from the public regarding the background of NASD members and their associated persons.
The NASD began operating its 800 number service on October 1, 1991. Upon the request of a caller, the NASD may disclose,
in the form of a written report, the following information contained in the CRD: 
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 past and present employment history of NASD members and their associated persons; all final disciplinary actions,
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 taken by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs, that relate to securities or commodities transactions;
and all criminal convictions reported on Form BD or Form U&hyph;4.

Under NASD procedures, the 800 number service operator does not provide any information over the telephone. Instead,
a written copy of the information requested is sent to the caller and to the NASD member and/or associated person who
is the subject of the inquiry. The identity of the caller remains confidential.

The NASD's 800 number service plan does not define the term ``disciplinary action.'' According to the NASD, however,
the term includes, but is not limited to, information provided in response to question 7 on Form BD and question 22 on
Form U&hyph;4.

In 1993, the Commission approved a rule change by the NASD to expand the scope of information that is reportable through
its 800 number service.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, in addition to the information set forth above, the NASD may disclose to the public such events as pending formal
disciplinary actions initiated by federal and state regulatory agencies and SROs; criminal indictments or informations;
civil judgments; and certain arbitration awards in securities and commodities disputes involving public customers.
Currently, the NASD relies on members and associated persons to report these events to the CRD on Form BD or Form U&hyph;4,
respectively. Because this represents the only means by which the NASD can obtain data about pending disciplinary
actions (other than its own), the quality of the CRD database, and thus of the 800 number service, depends on complete
and timely reporting by members and associated persons.

 note 6. The Commission notes that, in 1992, Congress requested that the General Accounting Office (``GAO'') conduct
a review of various aspects of the Penny Stock Reform Act, including the NASD's 800 number service. Among other things,
the GAO recommended that information about final arbitration awards be reported. Accordingly, the NASD submitted,
and the Commission approved, a rule change authorizing the NASD to disclose certain arbitration awards, as well as
pending formal disciplinary actions, through its 800 number service. In this context, the Commission notes that
it has requested all SROs to coordinate with the NASD the transfer of information about awards rendered in each exchange's
arbitration program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Commission's opinion, Rule 9 to Article XII should help fill a potential gap in the NASD's 800 number service,
by authorizing the Exchange to report the initiation of a formal CHX disciplinary proceeding
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 involving an Exchange member, member organization or associated person, and significant changes in the status thereof,
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 directly to the CRD. As a result, that information will be available to the public whether or not it is voluntarily reported
by the member or associated person. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change should enhance the
fairness and accuracy of the CRD database and, accordingly, of information released to the public through the 800
number service.

CHX Rule 9 provides the following examples of significant changes in the status of a pending formal disciplinary proceeding
which would require disclosure: the issuance of a decision by the President; and the filing of an appeal to and/or the
issuance of a decision by, a Judiciary Committee, the Exchange's Executive Committee or Board of Governors.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has long believed that investors need access to reliable information in order to protect themselves
against potential fraud and abuse. In this respect, Rule 9 to Article XII should help customers make an informed decision
about whether they should conduct or continue to conduct business with particular securities professionals. In
sum, the Commission has concluded that the rule change should increase the flow of information to the public and thus
should ultimately strengthen investor protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on July 5, 1994, the Government Securities Clearing Corporation (``GSCC'') filed with
the Securities and exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;GSCC&hyph;94&hyph;06)
as described in Items I, II, and III below, which Items have been prepared primarily by the self-regulatory organization.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change will modify GSCC's rules concerning the trade reporting requirements for category 2 inter-dealer

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The classification of category 2 IDBs was established by GSCC in 1993 in order to permit qualifying IDBs to engage in
up to ten percent of their trading activity in eligible securities with non-netting members.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Each category 2 IDB must act exclusively as a broker and at least ninety percent of its business, measured based on the
overall dollar volume of next day and forward settlement activity in eligible netting securities over the most recent
twenty day period, must be with netting members.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, Category 2 IDBs have clearing fund and margin requirements essentially the same as those of a category
1 dealer netting members.

The Commission approved category 2 IDBs in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32722 (August 12, 1993), 58 FR 42993.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For a temporary period established by GSCC's Board of Directors, the term netting members is defined to include certain
specifically designated grandfathered non-netting members firms that currently have IDB screen access. This will
temporarily allow category 2 IDBs to trade with nonmember dealers that historically have had access to the IDBs' screens.
An IDB's trading activity with grandfathered dealers will not be included for purposes of determining when an IDB
meets the ten percent scope of business limitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to monitor compliance with their scope of business requirements, each category 2 IDB is obligated to provide
GSCC in writing with a list of all of the legal entities that it acts on behalf of and must promptly inform GSCC of any change
to such list. Each IDB also is required to submit daily to GSCC all of its next day and forward settling trades in eligible
netting securities, including trades with non-grandfathered non-members and must indicate the buy and sell side
of each transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSCC's rule do not, however, expressly require that a category 2 IDB provide to GSCC for every trade done involving
an eligible netting security the identity of each buy side and sell side counterparty. This information is significant
to GSCC for risk monitoring and surveillance purposes. In particular, it is important for GSCC to understand and to
be able to assess the volume of and degree of concentration of trading done by a category 2 IDB with one or more specific
non-members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change, therefore, will expressly require each category 2 IDB to disclose to GSCC for every trade
done involving an eligible netting security, including trades done with non-members, the identity of each buy side
and sell side counterparty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSCC believes that because the proposed rule change allows GSCC to ensure that it can appropriately monitory its existing
netting members, it is consistent with Section 17A of the Act
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to GSCC.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MBSCC is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago Stock Exchange, Incorporated (``CHX''). CHX has agreed
to sell all of CHX's ownership interest in MBSCC to MBSCC participants and the National Securities Clearing Corporation
(``NSCC'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 After the transaction is completed, participants of MBSCC will own 100% of Class A common shares of MBSCC, and NSCC
will own 100% of Class B common shares of MBSCC.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
CHX will sell all of its shares to a corporation formed for the sole purpose of acquiring MBSCC stock (``MBSCC Acquisition
Corporation''). MBSCC participants will own 90% of MBSCC Acquisition Corporation, and NSCC will own 10% of MBSCC
Acquisition Corporation. After the sale of MBSCC stock to MBSCC Acquisition Corporation, MBSCC Acquisition Corporation
will be merged into MBSCC with MBSCC being the surviving corporation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
All MBSCC participants will have the opportunity to purchase shares in MBSCC in proposition to their usage of MBSCC.
After the initial sale to participants, participants who are not shareholders will be entitled to purchase one share
of Class A common stock. All shareholders will be required to sign the Shareholders Agreement described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change adopts corporate governance changes for MBSCC consistent with the transaction described
above. The proposed rule change amends Article FOURTH of MBSCC's Certificate of Incorporation, amends various provisions
of MBSCC's By-Laws and Rules, and authorizes MBSCC to enter into a Shareholders Agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article FOURTH of MBSCC's Certificate of Incorporation is amended to increase the number of shares of stock that MBSCC
is authorized to issue and to divide the common stock into Class A and Class B shares. The increased number of authorized
shares permits MBSCC participants to hold MBSCC shares in proportion to their usage of MBSCC without creating fractional
shares. The division of the common stock into Class A and Class B shares provides a mechanism whereby NSCC, which will
purchase 100% of Class B shares, is assured one seat on the board of directors of MBSCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the By-Laws and the Shareholders Agreement set forth, among other things, the number of directors,
their eligibility, and the manner in which directors will be elected. Specifically, the amendment to Article 3, Section
3.1 of the By-Laws increases the size of the MBSCC board to thirteen from its present size of eleven directors.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, Article 3, Section 3.1 of the By-Laws and Section 2 of the Shareholders Agreement require that each director,
other than the NSCC director and one director that represents the management of MBSCC, must be an officer or general
partner of or hold a similar management position with a participant of MBSCC (``Participant Director'') and that
no more than one officer, partner, director, or employee of a participant may serve as director at any given time.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Article 3, Section 3.2 of the By-Laws and pursuant to the proposed Shareholders Agreement, one of the newly
created slots on the MBSCC board is for NSCC's delegate to the board, and one slot is for an additional representative
of participants. NSCC will elect one director of the Class III directors for so long as NSCC owns Class B shares. Section
3.1 of the By-Laws provides for a staggered board of directors with each of the three classes elected once every three
years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change also amends provisions of the By-Laws to lower the number of votes required to call a special
meeting from 75% to 25% of the outstanding voting power (Article 2, Section 2.3), to provide for waiver of notice of
a stockholders' meeting (Article 2, Section 2.4), and to authorize the board of directors to establish the salaries
of MBSCC's officers (Article 5, Section 5.2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2 of the Shareholders Agreement specifies how Participant Directors and members of the nominating committee
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 are elected. As is currently the practice, the nominating committee will nominate candidates for Participant Directors
and members of the following year's nominating committee.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Participants are given the opportunity to petition for additional candidates.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 If no petitions are filed, the participant shareholders must elect the candidates nominated by the nominating committee.

The Shareholders Agreement contains special provisions for participants that are bank holding companies (``BHC'')
(as such term is defined under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956) and their affiliates. The voting entitlement of
a BHC participant and its affiliates is limited to 4.9% of the total voting entitlements. The voting entitlement of
all BHC participants and their affiliates is limited to 24.9% of the total voting entitlements. Should the sum of the
voting entitlements of all BHC participants exceed 24.9%, each BHC participant's voting entitlement will be reduced
pro rata to comply with the 24.9% limitation. The 4.9% limitation will not apply to a BHC participant if that BHC participant
provides confirmation from the appropriate bank regulatory agency that the limitation is not applicable to that
BHC participant. The 24.9% limitation will not apply to BHC participants if any BHC participant provides confirmation
from the appropriate bank regulatory agency that the total voting entitlements of all BHC participants can exceed
24.9% of the total voting entitlements.

Participant shareholders may not remove a director of MBSCC, with or without cause but must remove a director for cause
if directed to do so by a majority of the directors. A 2/3 affirmative vote of the MBSCC shares is required to amend the
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws of MBSCC, for MBSCC to repurchase or issue any of its securities, or for
MBSCC to purchase securities not incident to MBSCC's normal business. In addition, the shareholders must vote as
directed by the board of directors for amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation relating to (1) Greater than
majority requirements of quorum and voting at board meetings; (2) cumulative voting for the election of directors;
(3) classification of directors; (4) shareholder rights to fix consideration for shares, to determine the stated
capital and surplus upon issuance, and to authorize a reduction in capital in respect of such shares; (5) shareholder
rights to fix compensation of directors; and (6) shareholder rights to elect and remove directors. In addition, the
board also has the authority to direct shareholder voting for the amendment of any By-Laws except any By-Law which
the board is prohibited from amending by the provisions of the By-Laws.

The provisions in the Shareholders Agreement governing voting include: (1) The obligation of the shareholders to
elect directors selected by all participants; (2) the prohibition against shareholders removing directors with
or without cause; (3) 2/3 majority voting requirements; and (4) requirements that the shareholders vote as directed
by the board for certain matters (

or amended by the consent of all of the parties to the agreement. If at the end of any calendar year there is no agreement
governing the voting of the shares in effect, the shares of MBSCC will be redistributed in proportion to each participant's
usage of MBSCC.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act and, therefore, is approving
the proposal. Specifically, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(C)
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act in that it assures the fair representation of its shareholders and participants in the selection of its directors
and administration of its affairs.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act does not define fair representation or set up particular standards of representation. Instead it provides
that the Commission must determine whether the rules of the clearing agency assure adequate representation of participants
and shareholders in the selection of the board of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs.
In its release setting forth the standards for registration of clearing agencies (``Standards Release''), the Commission
stated that rather than prescribing a single method for providing fair representation, the Commission would evaluate
each clearing agency's procedures on a case-by-case basis.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 With respect to providing participants with a meaningful opportunity to be represented in the selection of the board
of directors and the administration of the clearing agency's affairs, the Standards Release suggests a number of
methods can be used to comply with the fair representation standard. Among others, these include the allocation of
voting stock to all participants based on their usage of the clearing agency or the selection by participants of a slate
of nominees for which the stockholders of the clearing agency will be required to vote their shares.

The other suggestions in the Standards Release are: (1) Solicitation of board of director nominations from all participants;
(2) selection of candidates for election to the board of directors by a nominating committee which would be composed
of and selected by the participants or representatives chosen by participants; or (3) a number of directors chosen
by and from the participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MBSCC's proposal initially allows all participants to purchase voting stock based on their usage of MBSCC. Rather
than reallocating the voting shares each year in proportion to participants' usage of MBSCC, the Shareholders Agreement
requires the participant shareholders to elect directors selected by all participants. If the voting provisions
of the Shareholders Agreement expire, the participants' voting stock will be reallocated each year in accordance
with each participant's usage of MBSCC. Both methods of electing directors appear to be consistent with the methods
outlined in the Standards Release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Shareholders Agreement should ensure that the candidates for the board and the nominating committee represent
the entire MBSCC participant base. The nominating committee is directed to select candidates with a view toward providing
fair representation for the interests of a cross section of the participants. Other candidates may be nominated if
the nominating committee is petitioned by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other aspects to the proposed rule change serve to enhance the ability of small participants to have a voice in the administration
of MBSCC's affairs. By limiting each participant's representation on the board to only one director, MBSCC's board
should represent a cross-section of MBSCC's participant base and should not be dominated by one or two large participants.
To counter the potential for a few large participants to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote, certain provisions
of the Shareholders Agreement limit the shareholders' authority in favor of board power. For example, the shareholders
must vote as directed by the board regarding removal of directors and the amendment of certain provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation. In addition, by requiring a 2/3 vote to amend the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-Laws, a
greater consensus among shareholders must be obtained before making substantial changes to MBSCC's administration.
The Commission believes that the provisions enhancing the authority of the board of directors, who represent all
the participants, are consistent with a clearing agency's obligations of fair representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also believes that the limitation on the voting entitlement of BHC participants is permissible under
the fair representation requirements. During 1993, the BHCs' usage of MBSCC was less than 20% of the total usage of
MBSCC, and therefore, no reduction in the BHCs' voting entitlement would have been required. MBSCC has agreed to notify
the Commission if the BHCs' usage of MBSCC exceeds 24%. However, the Commission believes that even if a reduction of
the BHCs' voting entitlement occurs, the fair representation requirements are not violated because the provision
was adopted at the request of the BHCs, whose voting entitlements are being reduced, because of the Bank Holding Company
Act of 1956.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBSCC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of the notice of filing. The parties to the merger have agreed to close the transaction
during the first two weeks of August 1994. To permit an efficient transfer of ownership from the CHX to MBSCC participants,
it is necessary that the appropriate governance changes are in place. Therefore, the Commission finds sufficient
cause to accelerate approval of this proposal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 22, 1991 (56 FR 2190), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) established the Aviation Rulemaking
Advisory Committee (ARAC). The committee provides advice and recommendations to the FAA Administrator, through
the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification, on the full range of the FAA's rulemaking activities
with respect to aviation-related issues.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to develop such advice and recommendations, the ARAC may choose to establish working groups to which specific
tasks are assigned. Such working groups are comprised of experts from those organizations having an interest in the
assigned tasks. A working group member need not be a representative of a member of the full committee. One of the working
groups established by the ARAC is the Engine Harmonization Working Group.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA announced at the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA)_Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Harmonization
Conference in Toronto, Canada, (June 2&hyph;5, 1992), that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing
objective to ``harmonize'' the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) and the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Engine Harmonization Working Group new tasks are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Task 1, Fire Pervention_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Review FAR and JAR requirements and create one set of common requirements (FAR 33.17; JAR&hyph;E&hyph;530).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Task 2, FAR 35_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conduct a comparison of FAR Park 35 and JAR&hyph;P requirements and advisory material and identify significant differences.
This comparison should clarify and redefine existing requirements to include new standards to reflect recent advancements
in design and construction of composite material propellers, propeller control systems (such as dual acting control
systems) and electronic controls.

For each task listed, the Engine Harmonization Working Group should develop and present to the ARAC:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A recommended work plan for completion of the tasks, including the rationale supporting such as a plan, for consideration
at the meeting of the ARAC to consider transport airplane and engine issues held following publication of this notice;

requirements or compliance methods are not recommended, a draft report stating the rationale for not making such
recommendations; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A status report at each meeting of the ARAC held to consider transport airplane and engine issues.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation and with the City of Sacramento, will prepare
an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a 4-lane connector roadway between Garden Highway
and Arden Way which includes construction of a bridge over the Natomas East Main Drainage Canal (NEMDC). The connector
and bridge are needed to meet existing and projected traffic demands. The length of the connector roadway is approximately
1.3 miles including the bridge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to be considered may include (1) Taking no action; (2) widening West El Camino Boulevard; and (3) different
alignment crossings of the Natomas East Main Drainage Canal. Variations of grade and alignment may be studied for
the various build alternatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in
this proposal. Public and agency scoping meetings will be held as required. A public meeting will be held upon completion
of the draft EIS. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meeting. The draft EIS will be available for
public and agency review and comment prior to the public meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposal are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA Chief of District Operations at the address indicated above.

Under the authority in Section 607(h)(4)(B) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 U.S.C. 1177(h)(4)(B)),
we hereby determine and announce that the applicable rate of interest on the amount of additional tax attributable
to any nonqualified withdrawals from a Capital Construction Fund established under Section 607 of the Act shall be
5.62 percent, with respect to nonqualified withdrawals made in the taxable year beginning in 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination of the applicable rate of interest with respect to nonqualified withdrawals was computed, according
to the joint regulations issued under the Act (46 CFR 391.7(e)(2)(ii)), by multiplying eight percent by the ratio
which (a) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year immediately preceding the beginning
of such taxable year bears to (b) the average yield on 5-year Treasury securities for the calendar year 1970. The applicable
rate so determined was computed to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By notice published on August 1, 1994, NHTSA scheduled a public meeting for August 17, 1994 regarding an appeal by Fisher-Price,
Inc., of NHTSA's denial of its petition for an exemption from the recall requirements of the National Traffic and Motor
Vehicle Safety Act. Fisher-Price recently advised the agency that it is now taking the position that it has not determined
that its child safety seats failed to comply with the flammability requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 213. Under the agency's regulations, a manufacturer may not seek an exemption from the recall requirements in
the absence of such a determination. Therefore, this proceeding is hereby terminated, and the public meeting is hereby
cancelled.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 11, 1993, a contractor for NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance (OVSC) tested certain child safety
seats manufactured by Fisher-Price to ascertain whether those seats complied with the requirements of Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems.'' The results of those tests indicated that
the seats failed the flammability requirements of that standard, which are incorporated by reference from FMVSS
No. 302, ``Flammability of Interior Materials,'' in that the shoulder belt webbing of the seats burned at a rate above
the limit established by the standard. Upon receipt of the test results, OVSC opened a noncompliance investigation,
NCI 3270.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although Fisher-Price initially resisted OVSC's suggestion that the company should make a formal determination
that the seats failed to comply, on September 16, 1993, Fisher-Price, submitted a letter, pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573,
``Defect and Noncompliance Reports,'' notifying the agency that it had ``become aware of information suggesting
that the molded shoulder belt webbing on its Model AO9191, DO9101, 9103, 9149, 9173, 9179, and 9180 car seats may not
comply with the requirements of FMVSS 302.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrently, Fisher-Price filed a petition asking NHTSA for ``an exemption from the notification and remedy requirements
*&blank;*&blank;* based on an inconsequential noncompliance with the requirements *&blank;*&blank;* as related
to motor vehicle safety.'' This petition was filed pursuant to former section 157 of the Act (now 49 U.S.C. 30118(d)
and 30120(h)) and 49 CFR Part 556, ``Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 49 CFR 556.4(a), inconsequentiality petitions may only be filed by a manufacturer following a determination
that a vehicle or item of equipment produced by the manufacturer contains a defect or fails to comply with an applicable
FMVSS. In its September 16, 1993 letter, Fisher-Price stated that ``[i]n order to comply with the requirements of
49 CFR 556.4(b)(6) [sic] that a report in accordance with 49 CFR Part 573 be submitted with its Petition for exemption,''
it was providing the information required by Part 573.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the circumstances, including the fact that the results of the compliance tests conducted both by OVSC and by
Fisher-Price clearly indicated that the seats in question did not satisfy the flammability requirements of the standard,
NHTSA interpreted Fisher-Price's statement as a notification of the company's noncompliance determination. Therefore,
the agency accepted the inconsequentiality petition for processing. It published a notice that the petition had
been filed on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59511), and denied the petition on March 22, 1994. Notice of the denial was published
on May 5, 1994 (59 FR 23253). On May 6, Fisher-Price appealed the denial and asked for a public meeting. Notice of the
appeal was published on June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30957), and the public meeting requested by the company was scheduled for
August 17, 1994 (59 FR 39015).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon reviewing the documents that Fisher-Price submitted with its appeal, NHTSA noted that Fisher-Price seemed
to be taking the position that its child safety seats did not fail to comply with FMVSS No. 213. Therefore, the agency
requested Fisher-Price to clarify whether it had in fact made a noncompliance determination. On August 10, 1994,
Fisher-Price advised NHTSA that it would not concede that its seats failed to comply with the standard and that its
September 16, 1993 letter should not be construed as a determination of noncompliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because 49 CFR 556.4(a) precludes consideration of Fisher-Price's petition for an inconsequentiality exemption
in the absence of such a determination, NHTSA is terminating this proceeding (Docket 93-79) and is cancelling the
public meeting scheduled for August 17, 1994. The agency plans to take further action with respect to the noncompliance
investigation in the near future.

In accordance with the procedures governing the application for, and the processing of, exemptions from the Department
of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Part 107, Subpart B), notice is hereby given that the
Office of Hazardous Materials Safety has received the applications described herein. This notice is abbreviated
to expedite docketing and public notice. Because the sections affected, modes of transportation, and the nature
of application have been shown in earlier Federal Register publications, they are not repeated here. Requests for
modifications of exemptions (e.g. to provide for additional hazardous materials, packing design changes, additional
mode of transportation, etc.) are described in footnotes to the application number. Application numbers with the
suffix ``X'' denote a modification request. Application numbers with the suffix ``P'' denote a party to request.
These applications have been separated from the new applications for exemptions to facilitate processing.

Biweekly Notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications and Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Involving No Significant Hazards Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from July 25, 1994, through
August 5, 1994. The last biweekly notice was published on August 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice Of Consideration Of Issuance Of Amendments To Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, And Opportunity For A Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By September 16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the
subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes
to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene.
Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules
of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy
of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW.,
Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a
hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on
the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice
of a hearing or an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
(Project Director)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the
local public document room for the particular facility involved.

Description of amendment requests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendment requests would revise Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.8.3 and Surveillance Requirement
4.4.8.3.1, ``Overpressure Protection Systems.'' Specifically, the LCO and surveillance requirements are revised
to clarify that both shutdown cooling system (SCS) suction line relief valves shall be OPERABLE and aligned to provide
overpressure protection not only during reactor (RCS) cooldown or heatup evolutions, but also during any steady
state temperature periods maintained in the course of RCS cooldown or heatup evolutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard 1 -- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments provide further clarification of the Technical Specifications and represent an additional
operating limitation. Incorporating the noted clarification will not change the bases or assumptions contained
in the safety analysis for this system. The most limiting low-temperature overpressure protection (LTOP) transients,
the starting of an idle reactor coolant pump (RCP) and the inadvertent actuation of two high pressure safety injection
(HPSI) pumps into a solid RCS, are not affected by the proposed clarification. Therefore, the proposed amendments
do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 2 -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clarifying the applicability of the LCO's and surveillance for steady state periods achieved and maintained during
either a heatup or cooldown evolution does not modify the design or operation of plant equipment. No new or different
failure modes will be introduced by incorporating this clarification into the LCO and surveillance requirement.
Therefore, the proposed amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clarification will enhance LCO 3.4.8.3 and Surveillance Requirement 4.4.8.3.1 for heatup and cooldown evolutions
by ensuring operators are aware of this applicability during periods of steady state conditions. This clarification
does not involve a change to safety limits, setpoints, or design margins. As such, the proposed amendments will not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety at PVNGS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment requests:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments would increase the minimum nitrogen accumulator pressure for the atmospheric dump valves
(ADVs), as stated in the surveillance requirements of Technical Specification (TS) 3/4.7.1.6. The change to the
Bases increases the minimum time the ADV accumulators must be operable.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard 1 -- Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change in the nitrogen accumulator supply minimum pressure will not increase
the probability or consequences of any accident previously analyzed. The nitrogen accumulator pressure is normally
maintained between 650-680 psig. Nitrogen pressure from the accumulator is reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the
operation of the ADVs. The pressure reduction will remain the same with the higher minimum accumulator pressure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 2 -- Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increasing the nitrogen accumulator minimum pressure does not create any new or different accidents than those previously
evaluated. The normal air supply (the Instrument Air System) to the ADV is maintained between 105 to 125 psig. Currently,
nitrogen from the accumulator is reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the ADV. The increased minimum pressure in the accumulator
will still be reduced to 105 psig prior to use in the ADV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 3 -- Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The limitation on maintaining the nitrogen accumulator at a certain pressure is to ensure that a sufficient volume
of nitrogen is in the accumulator to operate the associated ADV. Maintaining a higher minimum pressure ensures that
sufficient nitrogen will be available to maintain the unit at HOT STANDBY for four hours and an additional 9.3 hours
to reach COLD SHUTDOWN under natural circulation conditions in the event of failure of the normal control air system.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment requests: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would enhance the PVNGS Technical Specifications (TS) by adding a limiting condition for
operation (LCO) action statement to Entry VIII B of Table 3.3-3, ``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation.''
The proposed action statement would enhance safe plant operation by requiring timely plant shutdown if more than
one of the new solid state degraded voltage relays in either train of 4.16kV are inoperable or not energized.

Standard 1--Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequence of an accident previously evaluated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will add an action statement to TS Table 3.3-3 entry VIII B which would allow eight hours to effect
repairs. This action statement would be entered if more than one of the required four degraded voltage relays on either
4.16 kv bus is inoperable or not energized. If the eight hour allowed outage time is not met, the unit is placed in Hot
Standby within six hours and in Cold Shutdown within the next thirty hours. Technical Specification 3.8.3.1 currently
allows eight hours to restore a 4.16 kv bus in the event of a loss of power to that bus. The loss of degraded voltage relays
on that bus does not impact plant nuclear safety any more than the loss of the bus itself. Furthermore, even with the
loss of all four degraded voltage relays monitoring one 4.16 kv bus (for example, due to a blown 125 vdc circuit fuse),
the loss-of-voltage relays on that bus, and the degraded voltage relays, as well as the loss-of-voltage relays monitoring
the other bus would be unaffected. None of the UFSAR chapter 15 accident analyses are affected by this proposed amendment.
The existing TS requirements and those components to which they apply are not altered by this TS amendment. There are
no changes to the maintenance, surveillance, and/or qualification of any component/function in Table 3.3-3. Therefore,
the addition of this proposed eight hour action statement to Table 3.3-3 entry VIII B does not increase the probability
of occurrence or the consequences of any previously evaluated accident.

Standard 2--Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TS requirements and the components to which they apply are not altered by this amendment. The new solid state degraded
voltage relays in each 4.16 kv bus were installed under the 10 CFR 50.59 change process. APS [Arizona Public Service
Company] determined that the installation created no unreviewed safety question. This amendment has no impact on
plant maintenance, testing, shutdown equipment, or component qualification. Plant operational safety is enhanced
by this amendment. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident is not created by this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 3--Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TS does not alter existing TS requirements or those components to which they apply. More specifically, there is
no impact on safe plant shutdown, maintenance, containment isolation capability, containment leakage rate, or
the operability of safety related valves. Therefore, the addition of the proposed action statement to the TS will
not involve reduction in a margin of safety for fission product release to the atmosphere.

Description of amendments request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant (CCNPP) Units 1 and 2 Technical Specification
(TS) Section 4.7.1.2.c to extend the interval for three Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) surveillance requirements from
18 to 24 months. Specifically, TS Section 4.7.2.c.1 requires the verification of each automatic valve in the flowpath
actuate to its correct position and each AFW pump automatically start upon receipt of each AFW actuation system test
signal; TS Section 4.7.2.c.2 requires verification that the AFW system is capable of providing a minimum 300 gallons
per minute nominal flow to each leg. This request is one of a series of proposed license amendments that would eliminate
the need for mid-cycle surveillance outages by extending 18-month frequency surveillances to every refueling outage
(nominally each 24 months).

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System provides a safety-related source of feedwater to the steam generators to mitigate
design basis accidents involving loss of Main Feedwater. Failure of the AFW System is not an initiator for any previously
analyzed accident. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve an increase in the probability of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A historical review of surveillance test results and system performance indicates that the AFW System is very reliable.
In addition, monthly surveillances of the AFW System will continue to verify proper pump and valve operation. The
AFW System reliability and monthly surveillances provide assurance that undetected system degradation will not
occur between 24-month surveillances. Therefore, the AFW System will continue to perform its safety function and
there will be no significant increase in the consequences of accidents. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification
changes do not increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requested revision to increase the interval for some AFW surveillances from 18 to 24 months does not involve a
significant change in the design or operation of the plant. No hardware is being added to the plant as part of the proposed
change. The proposed change will not introduce any new accident initiators. Therefore, this change would not create
the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin
of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AFW System provides a margin of safety by providing a safety-related alternate supply of feedwater to the steam
generator for removal of decay heat and cooldown of the Reactor Coolant System. The proposed changes do not affect
the operation or design of the AFW System. Monthly surveillances and historical data provide assurance that the reduction
in surveillance frequency will not adversely affect our ability to detect degradation in the system. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

This amendment is an additional followup to the amendment request of May 29, 1992, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on July 8, 1992 (57FR30242), which changed the Technical Specifications Section 1.0, Definitions, to accommodate
a 24-month fuel cycle and which proposed the extension of the test intervals for specific surveillance tests. This
amendment proposes extending the surveillance intervals to 24 months for the following additional surveillance
tests:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Calibrate and test channels for Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) initiation on steam generator water level (low-low).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Test channels for Auxiliary Feedwater initiation on trip of main feedwater pumps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee's amendment proposal of November 25, 1992, requested approval for extending the surveillance interval
of the Auxiliary Feedwater System to accommodate a 24-month fuel cycle and the approved change was issued in License
Amendment No. 166. Subsequently, the licensee determined that two additional surveillances associated with this
system had not been identified in the November 25, 1992, request. This amendment proposal requests approval of the
additional surveillances. The changes requested by the licensee are in accordance with Generic Letter 91-04, ``Changes
in Technical Specification Surveillance Intervals to Accommodate a 24-Month Fuel Cycle.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration since:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test results over the last four refuelings confirmed system operability with only one failure. This failure would
not have impaired the ability of the auxiliary feedwater system to perform its intended safety function. The auxiliary
feedwater system is redundant and diverse. The failure in the turbine driven pump did not impact the motor driven pumps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the historical test data, it is concluded that no significant increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident would be incurred by extending the operating cycle due to an increased surveillance interval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure noted from the past test data appears random in nature and would not have defeated the redundancy in design
that exists in the AFW system. The AFW system would have been capable of performing its intended safety function and
therefore a new or different kind of accident would not have been created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past historical data demonstrates that the AFW systems would perform their safety function for an extended operating
cycle should the surveillance period be extended by several months.

Generic Letter (GL) 86-10, dated April 24, 1986, and GL 88-12, dated August 2, 1988, from the NRC provided guidance

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application of the standards for determining whether a ``Significant
Hazards Consideration'' exists by providing certain examples in 51 FR 7744 (dated March 6, 1986). Example (vii) of
those involving no significant hazards considerations relates to ``a change to conform a license to changes in the
regulations, where the license change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with
the regulations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, NRC Generic Letters 86-10 and 88-12, although not regulations, provide pertinent guidance relative
to the above described proposed changes and implementation of the NRC fire protection regulations of 10 CFR 50.48(a).
Specifically, the generic letters allow licensees to delete fire protection related technical specifications,
provided that administrative requirements are added to technical specifications and a license condition is provided
that requires the implementation and maintenance in effect of the approved fire protection program. Further, the
generic letters provide for inclusion of the fire protection program into the UFSAR [Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report] and permits future changes to the fire protection program without prior NRC approval, all as provided by the
license condition and in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Therefore, since the actions required by
the generic letters have been taken and conform the license to the current interpretation of NRC fire protection regulations
as described in Generic Letters 86-10 and 88-12, with no changes to facility operations, these proposed changes are
in accordance with Example (vii) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the proposed changes to the Technical Specifications are deemed
not to involve any ``Significant Hazards Considerations'' because operation of Indian Point Unit No. 2 in accordance
with these changes would not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fire protection program requirements are not affected in that the function, operation or surveillance requirements
for any fire protection system or component are not being altered. The proposed changes simply relocate these requirements
from the Technical Specifications to the UFSAR, are administrative in nature, and do not affect any other current
plant equipment or practices. Therefore, the conclusions of current accident analyses are not affected. Further,
as permitted by the proposed License Condition 2.K, changes in the NRC-approved fire protection program will require
an evaluation per the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to determine that the proposed change will not involve an unreviewed
safety question. Therefore, future changes to the fire protection program will be evaluated in accordance with appropriate
criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create the possibility for a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes introduce no new mode of plant operation, do not involve physical modification to any structure,
system or component, do not affect the function, operation or surveillance requirements for any equipment necessary
for safe operation or shutdown of the plant or of fire protection equipment which protects such equipment, and do not
involve any changes to setpoints or operating parameters. The changes are administrative only and all existing fire
protection requirements are maintained. Therefore, the changes can not result in an unanalyzed accident. Further,
as permitted by the proposed License Condition 2.K, changes in the NRC-approved fire protection program will require
an evaluation per the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to determine that the proposed change will not involve an unreviewed
safety question. Therefore, future changes to the fire protection program will be evaluated in accordance with appropriate
criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing fire protection program operability and surveillance requirements are retained as they are contained
in the FPPP [Fire Protection Program Plan], and compliance will continue through proposed License Condition 2.K.
Therefore, no margins of safety established by design or verified by testing to ensure operability of fire protection
systems or components are affected. Further, as permitted by the proposed License Condition 2.K, changes in the NRC-approved
fire protection program will require an evaluation per the criteria of 10 CFR 50.59 to determine that the proposed
change will not involve an unreviewed safety question. Therefore, future changes to the fire protection program
will be evaluated in accordance with appropriate criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above discussion, since these proposed changes to the Indian Point Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications
satisfy the criteria specified in 10 CFR 50.92, are similar to an example provided by the Commission of a change which
involves ``No Significant Hazards Considerations'', and are not similar to any examples that involve a ``Significant
Hazards Consideration'', Con Edison has determined that this amendment application does not involve any ``Significant
Hazards Considerations.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification changes have been reviewed by the Station Nuclear Safety Committee and the
Con Edison Nuclear Facilities Safety Committee. Both committees concur that these proposed changes do not represent
any ``Significant Hazards Considerations.''

Consistent with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application involves no significant hazards based
on the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the probability nor the consequence of an accident previously analyzed is increased due to the proposed changes.
There are no changes on the existing offsite power supply configuration or on the existing diesel fuel oil supply system
or inventory requirements. This proposed amendment will allow for three diesel operation when a fuel oil storage
tank or transfer pump is unavailable. In the event of an accident at this time, the three diesel operation would allow
for more than minimum safeguards to be available, with maximum safeguards available for the first part of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing 138 kV and 13.8 kV offsite power reliability is maintained with this change. There is no impact on availability
of the alternate AC system, the three gas turbines, with this change. This change is consistent with the original licensing
basis that the AEC accepted for the diesel fuel oil supply system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed amendment maintains
the reliability of the preferred 138 kV and 13.8 kV offsite power and is consistent with the original licensing basis
for diesel fuel oil inventory.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TSs) 3/4.4.5 and 3/4.4.6.2 and associated bases
to allow the implementation of interim steam generator tube plugging criteria for the tube support elevations during
cycle 11. The allowed primary-to-secondary operational leakage from any one steam generator is proposed to be reduced
from 500 gallons per day (gpd) to 150 gpd. The total allowed primary-to-secondary operational leakage from all steam
generators would be reduced from one gallon per minute (1440 gpd) to

1. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no tube support plate [TSP] restraint) at room temperature
conditions show[s] burst pressures in excess of 5000 psi for indications of outer diameter stress corrosion cracking
with voltage measurement as high as 19 volts. Burst testing performed on intersections pulled from BVPS [Beaver Valley
Power Station] with up to a 2.7 volt indication shows measured burst pressure in excess of 6600 psi at room temperature.
Burst testing performed on pulled tubes from other plants with up to 7.5 volt indications show[s] burst pressures
in excess of 6300 psi at room temperatures. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum
strength levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds
the safety factor requirements of RG [Regulatory Guide] 1.121. As stated earlier, tube burst criteria are inherently
satisfied during normal operating conditions due to the proximity of the TSP. Test data indicates that tube burst
cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes which have 100 percent through wall electric discharge machining (EDM)
notches, 0.75 inch long, provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Since tube to TSP proximity precludes
tube burst during normal operating conditions, use of the criteria must retain tube integrity characteristics which
maintain a margin of safety of 1.43 times the bounding faulted condition steam line break (SLB) pressure differential.
As previously stated, the RG 1.121 criterion requiring maintenance of a safety factor of 1.43 times the SLB pressure
differential on tube burst is satisfied by 7/8 inch diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes
less than 8.82 volts regardless of the indicated depth measurement. The plugging criteria (resulting in a projected
end-of-cycle [EOC] voltage) compares favorably with the 8.82 volt structural limit considering the extremely slow
apparent voltage growth rate of indications at BVPS. Using the established methodology of RG 1.121, the structural
limit is reduced by allowances for uncertainty and growth to develop a beginning-of-cycle (BOC) repair limit which
should preclude indications at EOC conditions which exceed the structural limit. The non-destructive examination
(NDE) uncertainty component is 20.5 percent and is based on the EPRI [Electric Power Research Institute] Alternate
Repair Criteria (ARC). A bounding growth allowance of 40 percent will be applied. This value is conservative for BVPS
Unit 1. The BOC maximum allowable repair limit should not permit the existence of EOC indications (when the 40 percent
growth and 20.5 percent uncertainty allowances are applied) which exceed the 8.82 volt structural limit. By adding
NDE uncertainty allowances and an allowance for crack growth to the repair limit, the structural limit can be validated.
Therefore, the maximum allowable BOC repair limit (RL) based on the structural limit of 8.82 volts can be represented
by the expression:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RL + (0.205 X RL) + (0.40 x RL) = 8.82 volts, or the maximum allowable BOC repair limit can be expressed as:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RL = 8.82 volt structural limit/1.605 = 5.5 volts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is reasonable that this repair limit (5.5 volts) could be applied for IPC [interim plugging criterion] implementation
to repair bobbin indications greater than 1.0 or 2.0 volts independent of RPC [rotating pancake coil] confirmation
of the indication. The analyses were performed based on a 1.0 or 2.0 volt repair limit. Duquesne Light Company has chosen
to use a steam generator tube repair limit of 1.0 volt. Conservatively, an upper limit of 3.6 volts will be used to assess
tube integrity for those bobbin indications which are above 1.0 volt but do not have confirming RPC calls. This 3.6
volt upper limit for non-confirmed RPC calls is consistent with other recently approved IPC programs for the two other
plants with 7/8 inch tubing that currently implement IPCs. Since the upper bound for repair of non-confirmed RPC is
limited to a value far less than the limit associated with a full alternate criteria, the establishment of the repair
limits are [is] judged to be independent of the pulled tube data base used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservatism of the growth allowance used to develop the repair limit is shown by the most recent BVPS eddy current
data. The average voltage growth for all indications was 16 percent while the average voltage growth for indications
greater than 0.75 volts at BOC was 6 percent. The largest overall voltage growth in a particular steam generator was
found in the ``A'' steam generator, which had an overall average growth of 25 percent. Only two tubes had an absolute
voltage growth which exceeded 1.0 volt for Cycle 9. The maximum absolute voltage growth in the 1993 inspection was
recorded to be 1.18 volts. Each of the last three inspections, which included 100 percent of all hot leg tubes, showed
decreasing voltage growth trends in each successive inspection for all categories; overall voltage growth, growth
of BOC indications less than 0.75 volts, and growth of indications greater than 0.75 volts. The decreasing voltage
growth rate trend data indicates that DLC has good control of the ODSCC [outer diameter stress corrosion cracking]
occurring in the BVPS Unit 1 steam generators and also implies that atypical voltage growth of a few indications is
unlikely.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously established that a postulated
main SLB [steam line break] outside of containment but upstream of the main steam isolation valve (MSIV) represents
the most limiting radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the interim plugging
criteria, it will be determined whether the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the
end of Cycle 11 are [is] projected to be such that primary-to-secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses
within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. A separate calculation has determined this allowable SLB leakage
limit to be 6.6 gpm in the faulted loop. This limit was calculated using the Technical Specification RCS [reactor coolant
system] Iodine-131 activity level of 1.0 micro Curies per gram dose equivalent Iodine-131 and the recommended Iodine-131
transient spiking values consistent with NUREG-0800. The projected SLB leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed
in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 will be used to calculate EOC leakage. The log-logistic probability of leakage
correlation will be used to establish the SLB leak rate used for comparison with the 6.6 gpm faulted loop allowable
limit. Due to the relatively low voltage levels of indications at BVPS and low voltage growth rates, it is expected
that the actual calculated leakage values will be far less than this limit. Additionally, the current Iodine-131
levels as of May 1994 at BVPS are about 1000 times less than the Technical Specification limit of 1.0.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Application of the criteria requires the projection of postulated SLB leakage, based on the projected EOC voltage
distribution for the upcoming cycle. Projected EOC voltage distribution is developed using the most recent EOC eddy
current results and a voltage measurement uncertainty. Data indicate that a threshold voltage of 2.8 volts would
result in through wall cracks long enough to leak at steam line break conditions. Draft NUREG-1477 requires that all
indications to which the IPC are applied must be included in the leakage projection. Tube pull results from another
plant with 7/8 inch tubing with a substantial voltage growth data base have shown that tube wall degradation of greater
than 40 percent through wall was readily detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with maximum through
wall penetration of 56 percent (42 percent average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest
recorded bobbin voltage from the EOC eddy current data. Based on the BVPS pulled tube and industry pulled tube data
supporting a lower threshold for SLB leakage of 2.8 volts, inclusion of all IPC intersections in the leakage model
is quite conservative. The ODSCC occurring at BVPS has historically resulted in relatively low voltage levels and
has exhibited decreasing voltage growth trends over the last three inspections. BVPS has not identified ODSCC as
a contributor to operational leakage. The current leakage levels at BVPS are negligible (less than 1 gpd). In order
to satisfy the requirements of draft NUREG-1477, EOC 10 eddy current data will be used to calculate the projected SLB
leakage according to draft NUREG-1477 methodology. Leakage calculated using the recommended EPRI leakage correlation
will also be provided. Duquesne Light Company is requesting that the NRC review and approve the EPRI SLB leakage calculation
methodology. Sufficient justification is included to establish acceptability of the EPRI leakage correlation
based on criteria provided by the NRC in the February 8, 1994, Industry/NRC working meeting on the voltage based criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to assess the sensitivity of application of the voltage based criteria upon SLB leakage, the EOC 9 eddy current
results were used to calculate postulated EOC 10 leakage using both the NUREG-1477 methodology and EPRI correlation
assuming that a 1.0 or 2.0 volt plugging limit were implemented at the BOC 10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Results indicate SLB leakage of 0.46 gpm and 0.044 gpm using the NUREG and EPRI methodologies with an assumed probability
of detection (POD) of 0.6 for a 2.0 volt repair limit. Since Duquesne Light Company has chosen to limit the voltage based
plugging limit at 1.0 volt, EOC 11 SLB leakage is analyzed to be approximately 5 percent lower than the calculated SLB
leakage with a 2.0 volt repair limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, implementation of the interim plugging criteria does not adversely affect steam generator tube integrity
and implementation will be shown to result in acceptable dose consequences, therefore, the proposed amendment does
not result in any increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

2. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed steam generator tube interim TSP plugging criteria does not introduce any significant
changes to the plant design basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in an accident
outside of the region of the TSP elevations; no ODSCC that has been identified at the TSP has been detected outside the
thickness of the TSPs. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture event would be expected in a steam generator in which
the plugging criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Duquesne Light Company will implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd per steam generator to
help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The technical specification limits
on primary-to-secondary leakage at operating conditions are to be a maximum of 450 gpd for all steam generators, or,
a maximum of 150 gpd for any one steam generator. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing operational leakage rate
limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leak-before-break considerations to detect a free span crack before
potential tube rupture during faulted plant conditions. The 150 gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and
plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated
with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits
are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with
the longest permissible crack is exceeded.

The single through wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 1.43 times the steam line break pressure differential
and SLB pressure differential alone are approximately 0.57 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd
will provide for detection of 0.41 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.62 inch long cracks at the lower 95 percent
confidence level leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP
to the tube and the potential exists for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the
maximum permissible crack must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown
prior to reaching critical crack lengths for SLB conditions using the lower 95 percent leakage data. Additionally,
this leak-before-break evaluation assumes that the entire crevice area is uncovered during blowdown. Partial uncovery
will provide benefit to the burst capacity of the intersection. Analyses have shown that only a small percentage of
the TSPs are deflected greater than the TSP thickness during a postulated SLB.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Steam generator tube integrity continues to be maintained through inservice inspection and primary-to-secondary
leakage monitoring, therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
developed is not created.

3. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria is demonstrated to maintain steam
generator tube integrity commensurate with the requirements of RG 1.121. RG 1.121 describes a method acceptable
to the NRC staff for meeting GDCs 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences of steam generator
tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam generator tubing,
as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be removed from service.
Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence of ODSCC at the TSP elevations
is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted plant conditions. The EOC distribution
of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in acceptable primary-to-secondary leakage
during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not adversely impacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the combined effects of loss of coolant accident (LOCA) and safe shutdown earthquake (SSE) on the steam
generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators
at some plants. This is the case as the TSP may become deformed as a result oflateral loads at the wedge supports at the
periphery of the plate due to the combined effects of the LOCA rarefaction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting
pressure differential on the deformed tubes may cause some of the tubes to collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing
reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow area increases the resistance to flow of steam from
the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential
that partial through wall cracks in tubes could progress to through wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the BVPS reactor coolant loop piping, the
probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered in the structural
design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line break or the pressurizer surge line
break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the conditions at BVPS for smaller breaks. The results
of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude to
result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation. The LOCA and SSE tube collapse evaluation performed
for another plant with Series 51 steam generators using bounding input conditions (large break loadings) is considered
applicable to BVPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing RG 1.83 considerations, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria
is supplemented by: enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to provide consistency in voltage normalization,
a 100 percent eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and RPC inspection requirements for the larger
indications left inservice to characterize the principal degradation as ODSCC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes which
must be repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs reduces the RCS flow margin. Thus, the implementation
of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of
increased tube plugging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction
in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any Bases of the Technical Specifications.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment revises technical specifications (TSs) related to the emergency feedwater system (EFW).
The proposed changes extend the allowable outage time when one EFW train is inoperable from 36 hours to 72 hours and
adapt other EFW sections from the ``Restructured Standard Technical Specifications for B&amp;W Plants'' to the
Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1) format.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

Criterion 1 - Does Not Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequences of an Accident Previously
Evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Emergency Feedwater (EFW) system mitigates the consequences of any event with a loss of normal feedwater. This
system is not the initiator of any previously analyzed accident, and therefore, changes to the specifications applicable
to the EFW system present no significant increase in the probability of any previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes that revise the required Actions and Allowable Outage Times associated with the EFW system have been evaluated
for their effect on the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) previously calculated in the ANO-1 Probabilistic Risk Assessment
(PRA). The new ANO-1 CDF values, incorporating the proposed AOT extension, are 4.73E-05 (for the turbine-driven
EFW pump) and 4.70E-05 (for the motor-driven pump). These values do not exceed the NRC Safety Goal of 1.0E-04 per reactor
year, as stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
50FR32138. The delta CDF associated with these changes (6.16E-07 for the turbine-driven EFW pump and 3.04E-07 for
the motor-driven EFW pump) have been evaluated with respect to criteria contained in SECY-91-270, dated August 27,
1991, and NUMARC 91-04, dated January 1992, and fall within the category of events of low risk significance requiring
no compensatory measures. This evaluation has shown the risk associated with the proposed changes to pose no undue
risk to public health and safety, to be categorized as having low risk significance, and involve no significant increase
in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operation result in more restrictive controls on the operability
of the motor-driven EFW pump. The previous specification required operability of both EFW pumps when the reactor
was heated above 280
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The proposed change requires the operability of the motor-driven EFW pump whenever the unit is above the cold
shutdown condition and any steam generator is relied upon for heat removal. With this change, the motor-driven EFW
pump is now required to be operable in a condition not previously specified, constituting an additional requirement
not previously specified. This change does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operation also incorporate an Allowable Outage Time for the turbine-driven
EFW pump steam supply valves which was not previously specified. The 7 day AOT is reasonable based on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The redundant steam supply (from the opposite steam generator) to the turbine-driven EFW pump is operable,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The motor-driven EFW pump is operable, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The probability of an event occurring that would require the inoperable steam supply valve to actuate is relatively
low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the surveillance specifications clarify the proper conditions required for the operability test
of the turbine-driven EFW pump, and revise the requirement for the verification of proper EFW flow path valve alignment.
The change clarifying the test conditions is required to ensure a sufficient steam supply to the turbine-driven EFW
pump to perform the test. During plant startup, from an RCS temperature of 280
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to an RCS temperature of approximately 525
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (corresponding to a steam generator pressure of approximately 830 psig) the turbine-driven EFW pump is classified
as available until operability is proven by successful completion of the surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. The proposed changes state that the EFW pumps and their associated flow paths shall be operable when
the RCS is above the cold shutdown condition with any steam generator relied upon for heat removal (motor-driven EFW
pump) and when RCS temperature is greater than or equal to 280
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (turbine-driven EFW pump). This specification requires that the flow paths be properly aligned to maintain
operability and is as restrictive as the current TS 4.8.1.c. The revised specification incorporates a new requirement
to verify operator flexibility in determining the method of verification. Some methods that could be considered
as fulfilling this requirement would include valve alignment checks, or a flow test verifying a level decrease in
the `Q' condensate storage tank with a corresponding level increase in both steam generators. These changes result
in no significant increase in the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other proposed changes included in this submittal, including the Bases changes, are considered to be administrative
in nature and have no effect on the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Relocation of the Emergency
Feedwater Initiation and Control (EFIC) requirements from Section 3.4 to Section 3.5 places the requirements for
this instrumentation system with the requirements for other instrumentation systems, resulting in greater consistency
throughout the ANO-1 TS. Information in the Bases associated with the EFIC system has been corrected to reflect the
actual plant condition and resolve a conflict with the ANO-1 Safety Analysis Report. The Bases changes add clarifying
information to aid the operator in determining the applicability of the various EFW specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2 - Does Not Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident from any Previously Evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes introduce no new mode of plant operation. The EFW system is not an event initiator. It functions
to mitigate the consequences of any event with a loss of normal feedwater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3 - Does Not Involve a Significant Reduction in the Margin of Safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes proposed to the Limiting Conditions for Operation associated with the EFW system are more conservative
than the current specification, thus resulting in an increase in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to the
actions required when both of the EFW trains are inoperable and the auxiliary feedwater pump is unavailable no longer
require an immediate plant runback, that is currently required, which could introduce a plant transient, thus resulting
in an increase in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes revising the Limiting Conditions for Operations also incorporate and Allowable Outage Time for the turbine-driven
EFW pump steam supply valves which was not previously specified. The 7 day AOT is reasonable based on:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The redundant steam supply (from the opposite steam generator) to the turbine-driven EFW pump is operable,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The motor-driven EFW pump is operable, and

3. The probability of an event occurring that would require the inoperable steam supply valve to actuate is relatively
low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to the surveillance specifications clarify the proper conditions required for the operability test
of the turbine-driven EFW pump, and revise the requirement for the verification of proper EFW flow path valve alignment.
The change clarifying the test conditions is required to ensure a sufficient steam supply to the turbine-driven EFW
pump to perform the test. During plant startup, from an RCS temperature of 280
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to an RCS temperature of approximately 525
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (corresponding to a steam generator pressure of approximately 830 psig) the turbine-driven EFW pump is classified
as available until operability is proven by successful completion of the surveillance requirement. The proposed
changes state that the EFW pumps and their associated flow paths shall be operable when the RCS is above the cold shutdown
condition with any steam generator relied upon for heat removal (motor-driven EFW pump) and when RCS temperature
is greater than or equal to 280
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (turbine-driven EFW pump). This specification requires that the flow paths be properly aligned to maintain
operability and is as restrictive as the current TS 4.8.1.c. The revised specification incorporates a new requirement
to verify proper alignment prior to relying upon any steam generator for heat removal. This allows the operator flexibility
in determining the method of verification. Some methods that could be considered as fulfilling this requirement
would include manual valve alignment checks, or a flow test verifying a level decrease in the `Q' condensate storage
tank with a corresponding level increase in both steam generators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change does involve an incremental reduction in the margin of safety since the extension of the EFW Allowable
Outage Time from 36 hours to 72 hours does result in a slight increase in the Core Damage Frequency (CDF) as calculated
in the ANO-1 Probabilistic Risk Assessment. The new ANO-1 CDF values, incorporating the proposed AOT extension,
are 4.73E-05 (for the turbine-driven EFW pump) and 4.70E-05 (for the motor-driven EFW pump). These values do not exceed
the NRC Safety Goal of 1.0E-04 per reactor year, as stated in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
50FR32138. The CDF associated with these changes (6.16E-07 for the turbine-driven EFW pump and 3.04E-07 for the motor-driven
EFW pump) have been evaluated with respect to criteria contained in SECY-91-270, dated August 27, 1991, and NUMARC
91-04, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1992, and fall within the category of events of low risk significance requiring no compensatory measures.
This reduction is not considered significant in that the increase in CDF has been evaluated as posing no undue risk
to the public health and safety and is categorized as having low risk significance.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Section 3.0 and 4.0 of the Technical Specifications (TSs) consistent with the
provision and intent of Generic Letter (GL) 87-09 dated June 4, 1987.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
TS 3.0.4 prevents entry into an operational mode or other specified condition unless Limiting Conditions for Operations
(LCOs) are met without reliance on Action Requirements. The intent of this TS is to ensure that a higher mode of operation
is not entered when equipment is inoperable or when parameters exceed their specified limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change clarifies TS 3.0.4 such that LCOs with Action Statements that permit continued operation for
an unlimited period of time are exempt from the restrictions of TS 3.0.4. This provision is modified to require an additional
plant safety review prior to implementing additional exceptions to 3.0.4 other than those currently stated in the
individual specifications. This proposed change is consistent with existing NRC regulatory requirements for LCOs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 4.0.3 incorporates a 24-hour delay in implementing the Action Statements due to a missed
surveillance requirement when the Action Statements provide a restoration time that is less than 24 hours. As reflected
in GL 87-09, this change is justified in that it is overly conservative to assume that systems or components are immediately
inoperable when a surveillance requirement has not been performed. The NRC concludes in Generic Letter 87-09 that
a 24-hour time limit balances the risks associated with an allowance for completing the surveillance within this
period against the risks associated with the potential for a plant upset and challenge to safety systems when the alternative
is a shutdown to comply with Action Statements before the surveillance can be completed. The NRC further states that
the potential for a plant upset and challenge to safety systems is increased if surveillances are performed during
actions to initiate a shutdown to comply with Action Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS 4.0.4 has been modified to note that its provisions shall not prevent passage through or to operational modes as
required to comply with Action Requirements. This change is consistent with the intent of the existing TS and represents
a clarification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No previously analyzed accident scenario is changed by the proposed TS changes described above. Initiating conditions
and assumptions remain as previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 3.0.4 is administrative in nature. Entry into an operational mode or other specified condition
will be allowed for those specifications not currently stating an exception to 3.0.4 when 1) the applicable LCOs Action
Requirement permits continued operation for an unlimited period of time and 2) the PORC [plant operations review
committee] has reviewed and approved the exception.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 4.0.3 will allow continued operation for an additional 24-hours after discovery of a missed
surveillance. As reflected in GL 87-09, missing a surveillance does not mean that a component or system is inoperable.
In most cases, surveillances provide positive verification of operability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 4.0.4 will alleviate conflict within the TS. The change is necessary to allow the plant to
proceed through or to required operational modes to comply with Action Statements even if applicable Surveillance
Requirements may not have been performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes do not affect the operation of the plant or the manner in which it is operated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 3.0.4 is administrative in nature and will have no impact on any margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 4.0.3 will allow up to 24-hours to perform a missed surveillance. In some cases this will eliminate
the need for a plant shutdown. As reflected in GL 87-09, the overall effect is an increase in plant safety by avoiding
unnecessary shutdowns and associated system transients due to missed surveillances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to TS 4.0.4 will eliminate an internal conflict within the TS and allow the plant to proceed through
or to required operational modes to comply with Action Statements even if applicable Surveillance Requirements
for that mode may not have been performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has previously evaluated these change in Generic Letter 87-09 and determined that the TS modifications
will result in improved TS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, a determination may be made that a proposed license amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of
a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Each standard is discussed as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a signifiant increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes proposed for St. Lucie Unit 1 Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.4.13 are similar to those recommended
by the NRC staff via Generic Letter 90-06 for Low Temperature Overpressure Protection (LTOP) systems. On the basis
of technical studies performed for Generic Issue 94, the staff concluded that LTOP system unavailability is a contributor
to the risk associated with overpressure transients during the shutdown modes of plant operation. Revisions to the
actions required and the time for completion of such actions, in the event that one or more Power Operated Relief Valves
(PORV) become inoperable, provide more rigor than the existing specifications and are designed to increase LTOP
system availability. The administrative restrictions do not change the results of existing analyses performed
to evaluate postulated accidents but will improve the availability of systems designed to mitigate pressure transients
that could occur within the LTOP range. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the facility license.
The changes do not involve the addition of new equipment or the modification of existing equipment, nor do they alter
the design of St. Lucie plant systems. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment
would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment provides additional administrative restrictions for the operation of LTOP equipment. The
applicability of Limiting Conditions of Operation (LCO) involving the PORVs will be extended to include Operational
MODE 6 when the head is on the reactor vessel, and the rigor of required actions and action compleiton times in the event
that one or more PORVs become inoperable will be increased. Consequently, the risk of low temperature operations
will be reduced and safety during the shutdown modes of operation will be enhanced. Therefore, operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Based on the discussion presented above and on the supporting Evaluation of Proposed TS Changes, FPL has concluded

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
...The proposed changes do not involve an SHC [significant hazards consideration] because the changes would not:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SRAS Logic Modification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the auctioneered power supply for the sensor cabinets will permit the reinstatement of the original
2-out-of-4 (six possible combinations) logic for SRAS initiation. The current logic only has four possible combinations.
Changing the minimum number of SRAS channels required to be operable from four to three does not significantly reduce
the available actuation combinations. Operation with one channel inoperable will still provide a 2-out-of-3 logic
(three possible trip combinations). With the current SRAS logic, operation with one channel in bypass does not meet
the single failure criterion for proper SRAS operation. Amendment No. 168 prevents that condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowing continued operation with three operable channels is consistent with the original Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical
Specifications (prior to Amendment No. 168).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note (f), which describes the current logic, will no longer apply after the auctioneering circuit is installed. This
note is for information only and has no associated action or surveillance requirements. Therefore, removal of note
(f) cannot affect either the probability or consequences of a postulated accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the change in the minimum number of channels required to be operable, Action statement 4 will be revised
to allow a limited period of two hours when a second channel may be placed in bypass for performance of surveillance
testing. This is acceptable due to the installation of the auctioneering circuit and restoration of the full SRAS
logic. Prior to the implementation of the short term modifications and Amendment No. 168, Action Statement 2 also
applied to the SRAS. That Action Statement allows two hours of operation with two channels out of service. However,
Action Statement 2 requires one of the two channels to be placed in the tripped position.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postulating a LOCA [loss-of-coolant accident] and an additional failure, while in an action statement that specifies
a maximum allowed outage time, is beyond the design basis of Millstone Unit No. 2. However, with one SRAS channel in
bypass and one in the tripped position, an additional failure (such as the loss of a DC vital bus) following the onset
of a LOCA could result in a false SRAS signal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From an overall safety perspective, the potential consequences from a false SRAS at the onset of a LOCA are more severe
than those from the failure to automatically generate an actuation signal. Proposed Action Statement 4 would require
actuation of the remaining channel (following a LOCA and a loss of DC bus as a second failure) to initiate the SRAS. The
existing operation procedures instruct the operator to ensure that the SRAS actuation occurs when the refueling
water storage tank level decreases to a predetermined value. In the unlikely event that a LOCA occurred while a Action
Statement 4 and no SRAS was generated at the appropriate time due to an additional failure which prevents one channel
from tripping, the SRAS would be manually initiated by the operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount of time that Millstone Unit No. 2 would operate under Action Statement 4 (with two SRAS channels in bypass)
is approximately 6 hours per month. This is based on the requirement to conduct monthly channel functional tests for
the three operable channels. The probability of a LOCA occurring during these surveillance, while in Action Statement
4, with a subsequent failure of the remaining 2-out-of-2 SRAS logic, is very low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sensor Cabinet Auctioneering
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new Technical Specification 3.3.2.2, which establishes the requirements for the ESFAS sensor cabinets
power supply drawers, permits 48 hours to restore an inoperable sensor cabinet power supply drawer to operable status.
A power supply drawer renders it inoperable, or if either its normal or backup power is not available.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing Technical Specification 3.8.2.1 contains an 8-hour action statement for restoring the power sources (VA-10,
20, 30, and 40) if they become inoperable. The proposed 48-hour action statement for the power supply drawers is appropriate
since the sensor cabinet would remain functional if either normal or alternate power was not available. However,
a LOCA and an additional failure while in the action statement could result in a false SRAS, since two channels would
supplied from a single DC power supply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to Amendment No. 168, operation with an inoperable power supply drawer could continue indefinitely, provided
the provisions of Technical Specification 3/4.3.2 were followed. Operation with a power supply inoperable for an
indefinite period of time places all the signals associated with that sensor cabinet in the tripped condition. This
creates a 1-out-of-4 tripped condition for SRAS. In this condition, the single failure required to be postulated
could result in a false SRAS actuation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This 48-hour action statement is consistent with other action statements for ESFAS such as Action Statement 1 of Table
3.3-3. Also, this is consistent with the current wording of Action Statement 4 which allows 48 hours to restore an inoperable
channel to operable while operating with the modified 2-out-of-4 logic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MSI Trip Button Addition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manual trip buttons provide a mechanism for the control room operator to initiate an MSI trip. The proposed Technical
Specification change will require that a plant shutdown be initiated if either channel is out of service for more than
48 hours, and establishes a requirement for surveillance testing every refueling outage. Including the trip buttons
in the Technical Specifications and establishing operation and surveillance requirements ensures their operability
commensurate with their safety significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the changes to Technical Specification 3/4.3 do not increase the probability or consequence of
an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SRAS Logic Modification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the number of channels required to be operable from four to three is acceptable since the original 2-out-of-4
logic will be restored. This change only affects the number and combinations of actuation channels necessary to initiate
a SRAS. There is no change to the source or types of initiators, nor is there a change to the automatic response resulting
from a SRAS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note (f), which described the modified logic, will no longer apply after the auctioneering circuit is installed.
This note is for information only and has no associated action or surveillance requirements. Therefore, removal
of note (f) cannot create a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Action Statement 4 restores the ability to operate for an indefinite period of time with one channel in bypass and
for a limited period of time while two channels are out of service. The change from the original action statement to
require that both channels be in bypass will prevent a false SRAS in the unlikely (and beyond design basis) event of
a LOCA with an additional failure of a DC bus while in an LCO [limiting condition for operation].

The addition of a Technical Specification for the sensor cabinet power supply drawers does not create a potential
for a new or different kind of accident. This new specification implements more restrictive operating requirements
for the sensor cabinets. These are necessary to ensure that the sensor cabinets are energized from their primary power
supply. The new specification does not affect the initiation of a SRAS signal nor the type of signal produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The auctioneering modification does bring two vital AC facilities together via isolation devices. This introduces
a potential for a new type of failure mechanism. As described in Attachment 1, adequate isolation ensures that a failure
on one side of an isolation transformer does not adversely degrade the other side.

MSI Trip Button Addition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The manual trip buttons provide a mechanism for the control room operation to initiate an MSI trip. The Technical Specification
change will require that a plant shutdown be initiated if either manual trip channel is out of service for more than
48 hours, and establishes a requirement for surveillance testing every refueling outage. The trip buttons were installed
during the 1992 outage. Establishing operability requirements and surveillance frequency cannot create a new or
different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
analyzed.

3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The net effect of the proposed modifications is to improve the reliability of the ESFAS and restore the design 2-out-of-4
logic for the SRAS. The proposed modifications improve the availability of the ESFAS, and do not affect the vital AC
instrument panels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Technical Specification changes establish controls for the used of the SRAS with the restored logic configuration.
The combination of the auctioneering of the power supplies, the restoration of the 2-out-of-4 logic, and the revised
Technical Specifications restores the margin of safety and operational flexibility originally designed for the
sensor cabinets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, there is no reduction in the margin of safety.

which is presented below:

1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed changes will result in abandoning in place certain remote shutdown system control valves and removing
from service and abandoning in place certain Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs) associated with the Residual
Heat Removal (RHR) system steam condensing mode, and will remove the interface between the High Pressure Coolant
Injection (HPCI) and RHR systems, therefore changing the primary containment pressure boundary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RHR system steam condensing mode is a non-safety related function of the RHR system; however, the pressure and
structural integrity of the associated piping and valves are safety-related. These proposed changes will not affect
any components required to perform the safety-related function of the RHR or HPCI systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of the RHR or HPCI systems to respond to an accident will not be degraded. Only valves specifically dedicated
for use for the RHR system steam condensing mode will be abandoned in-place, or removed from the plant. The valves'
handswitches which are part of the remote shutdown panel (RSP) controls, will be physically removed from the RSP,
since they will not perform any function (i.e., the associated valves will have the electrical power removed). The
flanges and penetration caps that will become part of the primary containment boundary will be periodically tested
for leakage as required by TS and 10CFR50, Appendix J. All piping and components that will remain operable will meet
the original design requirements. The other modes of operation of the RHR system (e.g., Low Pressure Coolant Injection
(LPCI), Shutdown [C]ooling (SDC)) will not be affected by these changes. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not
involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No new failure modes of RHR or HPCI systems are created by the proposed TS changes. The proposed changes will have no
impact on the existing High Energy Line Break (HELB) analysis for Limerick Generating Station (LGS). All valves or
piping removed and/or abandoned in place, are dedicated specifically for the RHR system steam condensing mode, and
will not affect the operation of any components or piping required for other modes of operation of the RHR or HPCI systems.
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The steam condensing mode is a non-safety related function of the RHR system and, therefore, is not addressed in the
TS. This mode will be physically separated from the other modes of operation of RHR and HPCI systems, and consequently,
will not preclude them from performing their safety-related functions. The remote shutdown system control valves
to be abandoned in place are not being used presently, and the proposed changes will not impact the safety operation
of LGS Unit 2. The primary containment penetration caps, safety-related pipe caps and the flanges replacing the removed
PCIVs will be designed, fabricated and installed in accordance with the original design requirements, i.e., American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&amp;PV) Code, Section III, 1971 Edition with
Addenda through Winter 1971. The added penetration caps and flanges will be capable of maintaining the primary containment
pressure boundary and isolation capabilities that were required of the PCIVs and will be tested for leakage periodically,
as required by TS and 10 CFR 50, Appendix J. Additionally, all piping and components that will remain operable will
meet original design requirements. Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

This amendment will change the Technical Specification 3.1.5 for each unit for the standby liquid control system

1. This proposal does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5*
(OPERATIONAL CONDITION 5 with any control rod withdrawn) does not affect the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. Design basis accident mitigation scenarios for SSES in OPCON 5 do not depend on, or require,
SLC operability; therefore, the proposed change to delete SLC operability in OPCON 5* does not affect the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater
operability check, does not affect the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Regarding
the SLC heater function, the operability of the SLC system depends on maintaining the temperature of the sodium pentaborate
solution above 70
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to prevent the boric acid from precipitating out of solution. SLC heater 'A' is used to maintain tank temperature
between 85
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F and 95
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, thus ensuring that the boric acid remains in solution. The operability of the heater 'A' is verified through
the daily performance of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.a.1, which checks SLC solution
temperature, and a control room alarm. Heater 'B' functions to raise SLC solution temperature prior to the mixing
of SLC chemicals - the mixing of sodium pentaborate and water is an endothermic (heat consuming) reaction. The operability
of heater 'B' is verified at the time when chemicals are added to the SLC tank, since a precondition for adding the chemicals
is using heater 'B' to increase tank temperature to 100
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. Heater 'B' does not function to maintain tank temperature during normal operation. Therefore, the proposed
change does not impact Susquehanna's ability to maintain SLC solution temperature and thus does not increase the
probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. This proposal does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5*
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident previously evaluated.
The purpose of the SLC System is to provide backup capability for bringing the reactor from full power to a cold, Xenon-free
shutdown, assuming that none of the withdrawn control rods can be inserted. This bases is consistent with the required
operability of the SLC System in OPCONs 1 &amp; 2. The proposed change does not affect the ability of SLC to meet its design
basis. No credit is taken for SLC in OPCON 5 to mitigate the effects of reactivity transients, and the SLC system is not
designed to terminate an inadvertent criticality event during core alterations (OPCON 5) with vessel water level
at least 22 feet above top of vessel flange. Therefore, no new or different accident scenarios are created by the proposed
change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater
operability check, does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change does not affect systems, structures, or components (SSCs) or the operation
of these [SSCs]. The heating and heater control subsystems of the SLC system will continue to function as they were
designed. The proposed change does not alter the heating limits or the method for maintaining SLC solution temperature.
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident or [sic] from
any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to delete the operability requirement for the SLC System in OPCON 5*
does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The potential for a decrease in the margin of safety,
under this proposed change, would be associated with periods during OPCON 5* when the SLC system was not operable.
Allowing the SLC system to be inoperable during OPCON 5* with the vessel level at least 22 feet above top of vessel flange,
represents no reduction in the margin of safety since the SLC System is not designed to terminate an inadvertent criticality
event with a greater volume of water in the reactor. Having the SLC system inoperable in OPCON 5* with reactor water
levels at normal operating volumes, does not significantly reduce the margin of safety because of the number of other
design and operating features which act to prevent inadvertent criticality events. Adequate shutdown margin is
maintained through design and administrative controls; including, Shutdown Margin Demonstration, Technical
Specification 3.1.1, defueling and refueling procedures, and refueling interlocks. In addition, the Reactor Protection
System monitors for recriticality and actuates the Control Rod Scram function if a significant reactivity addition
is sensed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Technical Specification change to delete Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.d.3, 18 month SLC heater
operability check, does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Adequate controls are in place,
independent of the 18 month heater operability check, to ensure that the temperature of the sodium pentaborate solution
is maintained above 70
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. These controls include Surveillance Requirement 4.1.5.a.1, which checks SLC solution temperature daily,
a control room alarm on low and high temperature, and the ambient temperature conditions in the SLC area which prevent
rapid changes in SLC solution temperature. Operability of the 'B' heater is not needed to maintain SLC solution temperature,
and the operability of this heater is verified at the time when chemicals are added to the SLC tank.

Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment would not involve a significant hazards

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will remove a license condition unrelated to nuclear safety. License condition 2.E incorporated
into the Operating License the requirements of U.S. Department of Interior publication ``Environmental Criteria
for Electric Transmission Systems'' - 1970. The goal of this standard is to ``safeguard aesthetic and environmental
values within the constraints imposed by the current state of high-voltage transmission technology.'' License
condition 2.E addresses the preservation of the environment and natural resources. Removing this condition from
the Facility Operating License has no bearing on plant safety or the health and safety of the public considering its
non-nuclear safety nature. The transmission line right-of-ways maintained by the Authority are subject to regulation
by other State and Federal agencies. Removal of this license condition will not affect operation of safety related
structures, systems or components nor affect the quality assurance program at the FitzPatrick plant. Therefore,
the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.

License condition 2.E of the James A. FitzPatrick Plant Operating License applies to the construction cleanup, restoration,
and maintenance of transmission lines. The Authority's transmission lines are managed under guidelines based on
the ``Generic Transmission Line Right-of-Way Management'' plan requirements. The requirements imposed by the
plan on the FitzPatrick transmission line right-of-ways exceed those of the U.S. Department of Interior publication
referenced in license condition 2.E in both scope and details. Therefore, implementing the proposed change will
not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes would modify paragraph 2.C.(3) of the Facility Operating License and relocate fire protection
requirements from the Technical Specifications to an administrative procedure. These changes are based on the guidance
contained in NRC Generic Letter 86-10, ``Implementation of Fire Protection Requirements,'' and Generic Letter
88-12, ``Removal of Fire Protection Requirements from Technical Specifications.''

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation of the FitzPatrick plant in accordance with the proposed Amendment will not involve a significant hazards
consideration as defined in 10 CFR 50.92, because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) This change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because no modifications, no changes to operating procedure requirements, no reduction in administrative
controls and no reduction in equipment reliability are being made as a result of these changes. This proposed amendment
relocates the fire protection LCOs [Limiting Conditions for Operation] and Surveillance Requirements from the
Technical Specifications to an Administrative Procedure. No significant changes in content are being made to the
Technical Specification requirements that are being relocated. Operating limitations will continue to be in effect,
and required surveillances will continue to be performed in accordance with written procedures and instructions
auditable by the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although future proposed changes to the fire protection program elements previously located in the Technical Specifications
will no longer be controlled by 10 CFR 50.36, proposed changes to the Fire Protection requirements will be controlled
by the License Condition and plant procedures. Programmatic controls will continue to assure that fire protection
program changes do not reduce the effectiveness of the program to achieve and maintain safe shutdown in the event of
a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The possibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than evaluated previously in the safety analysis
report is not created because no reduction to the fire protection requirements, no modifications, no changes to operating
procedure requirements, no reduction in administrative controls and no reduction in equipment reliability are
being made as a result of these changes. Programmatic controls will continue to assure that fire protection program
changes do not reduce the effectiveness of the program to achieve and maintain safe shutdown in the event of a fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) This proposed amendment does not involve a reduction to the approved fire protection program or Fire Protection
Technical Specification requirements because the Technical Specification fire protection requirements are being
relocated, with no significant change in content, to an administrative procedure. Since there is no reduction in
the requirements, no modifications, no changes to operating procedure requirements, no reduction in administrative
controls and no reduction in equipment reliability are being made as a result of these changes, there is no reduction
in the margin of safety.

The licensee has requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TS) to revise Table 3.6-1 (Non-Automatic
Containment Isolation Valves Open Continuously or Intermittently for Plant Operation) and Table 4.4-1 (Containment
Isolation Valves) to delete valves SI-1833A(B) and add valves SI-MOV-1835A(B). The valves being deleted no longer
perform a containment isolation function as a result of a modification which removed the boron injection tank. The
valves being added are needed for testing the safety injection pumps.

Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any
accident previously evaluated. The change permits the removal of the two containment isolation valves on the Boron
Injection Tank (BIT) bypass line. A previous amendment [Amendment No. 139, issued on October 15, 1993] to the Operating
License removed the functional requirement for the BIT. Consequently, the function of the BIT bypass line to provide
a Safety Injection [SI] pump test flow path has been rendered obsolete, permitting removal of the bypass line and associated
valves. The bypass line will be cut and capped to assure containment integrity, therefore eliminating the need for
containment isolation valves SI-1833A and SI-1833B. Opening the BIT outlet valve [SI-MOV-1835A or B] permits operability
testing of the SI pumps, and is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves.
The changes do not impact the current operability and surveillance requirements for the Safety Injection System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated. The change proposes to eliminate two containment isolation valves on the BIT bypass line whose function
has been rendered obsolete by a previous amendment to the Operating License. The bypass line will be cut and capped
to assure containment integrity, therefore eliminating the need for these containment isolation valves. Intermittent
opening of the BIT outlet valve is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves,
thereby allowing operability testing of the SI pumps. The changes do not impact the operability or surveillance requirements
for the Safety Injection System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety for the following reasons.
Currently, an orientation deficiency with the inboard BIT bypass isolation valve exposes its stem packing to the
non-isolable side of the valve. The modification corrects this problem by removing both isolation valves and capping
the pipes to assure integrity of the Containment and Safety Injection System. Additionally, removal of the isolation
valves removes the potential for containment leakage resulting from valve degradation. Finally, removal of the
BIT bypass line and its associated isolation valves does not inhibit the ability to test the SI pumps since a previous
modification approved in an Amendment to the Operating License removed the functional requirement for the BIT. Consequently,
the SI pumps may be flow tested with the BIT inservice, rendering obsolete the function of the BIT bypass line. Intermittent
opening the BIT outlet valve is consistent with the current provision permitting opening of the BIT bypass valves,
thereby allowing operability testing of the SI pumps.

(1) [This proposal does] not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fuel oil is used to support mitigation of design basis events involving loss of the
preferred (offsite) source of A.C. power. Fuel oil storage capacity has no effect on the probability of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Onsite fuel oil storage capability is designed to provide assurance of long term diesel operation to mitigate the
consequences of a design basis accident. The proposed change would increase the minimum required volume in the Seismic
Class I Diesel Fuel Oil Storage Tanks (DFOSTs), and would revise the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR),
as part of an effort to reconstitute the basis for SGS fuel oil storage capacity. The DFOST inventory at the proposed
minimum Technical Specification (TS) limit, combined with the emergency fill connection and Seismic Class III Fuel
Oil Storage Tank and transfer capability, would continue to provide a long term onsite fuel oil supply to the EDGs.
Operations and Emergency Preparedness procedures would facilitate the transfer of fuel oil, and procurement from
offsite sources as a contingency measure. Therefore, the ability to provide a long term supply of fuel oil to the EDG's
is maintained, and the proposed change would not result in any significant increase in consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change would increase the minimum DFOST level required by TS, and redefines the fuel oil storage and transfer
systems' capability based on plant specific fuel oil consumption rate and EDG load profiles. These changes would
not result in operation in any configuration prohibited by the present TS, and do not introduce the possibility of
any new type of accident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EDG fuel oil storage and transfer capability would continue to support reliable, long term EDG operation, thereby
maintaining an acceptable margin of safety relative to the ability of onsite A.C. power to support operation of equipment
important to safety. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.

1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes to the HPCI and RCIC steam line space isolation setpoints do not affect any precursor for any design
basis events or operational transients analyzed in the Browns Ferry Final Safety Analysis Report. Therefore, the
probability of an accident previously evaluated is not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HPCI and RCIC steam line space high temperature isolations are provided to ensure automatic closure of each system's
primary containment isolation valves for a HPCI or RCIC steam line break. The isolation occurs when a very small leak
has occurred. If the small leak is allowed to continue without isolation, offsite dose limits may be reached. As a result
of the environmental qualification program, the environmental responses of the reactor building to high energy
line breaks were analyzed. TVA used computer modeling techniques to predict the temperature response of various
reactor building zones to high energy line breaks. The results indicate that the setpoints for the HPCI and RCIC temperatures
switches should be lowered. The lower setpoints assure the timely initiation of a closure signal to the primary containment
isolation valves. Therefore, assuring the maximum allowable temperatures are not exceeded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the HPCI and RCIC steam line space isolation setpoints are in the conservative direction and
provides the same or earlier detection and isolation of HPCI and RCIC steam line breaks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed trip level settings are high enough to ensure that spurious trips do not occur from normal or transient
system operation and low enough to ensure that line breaks are detected and isolated before design conditions are
exceeded. Therefore, the proposed changes will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change to the HPCI/RCIC steam line space high temperature isolations does not involve any modification
to plant equipment or changes in operating procedures. No new failure modes are introduced. There is no effect on the
function or operation of any other plant system. No new system interactions have been introduced by the change. The
results of a break in the HPCI or RCIC steam lines remain as before. The HPCI or RCIC steam line area temperature switches
will still detect a break due to an increase in area temperature and provide an initiation signal to close the system
primary containment isolation valves to prevent reactor coolant loss. The proposed change will conservatively
serve to detect and mitigate HPCI and RCIC line breaks more expeditiously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change will not reduce the margin of safety. The proposed change ensure that HPCI and RCIC steam line breaks
are isolated at the same or lower steam line area temperatures. Computer modeling techniques were utilized to predict
the temperature response in various areas through which the HPCI and RCIC steam lines pass. The revised setpoints
are established above the maximum expected normal room temperatures to avoid spurious actions due to ambient conditions
and below the analytical limits to ensure timely pipe break detection and isolation. Substantial margin exist between
the maximum temperature expected in each area and the minimum actuation temperature determined for each temperature
switch. With the substantial margin between maximum temperatures for the areas and the minimum actuation temperature
of the switches, the maximum temperatures cannot result in actuation of the switches. The design and function of the
affected components has not been changed. Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change involves temporarily (one-year period) extending the 5-day AOT [allowed outage time] for the
250-volt shutdown board control power supplies to 45 days. As such, this change does not increase the probability
of any accident previously analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 250-volt DC Power System is required to function to mitigate the consequences of design basis accidents. The loss
of a single 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply will result in a loss of control power for the 480-volt and
the 4160-volt shutdown board that it serves. Loss of control power results in loss of only those engineered safeguards
supplied by its respective shutdown boards. Redundant safe shutdown equipment exists to mitigate the consequences
of design basis accidents. As discussed in Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) subsection 8.6.4.3, a single failure
of a shutdown board control power supply is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loss of a single 250-volt plant DC power supply will not prevent Unit 2 safe shutdown. The 250-volt plant DC power supply
system is designed so that any two out of the three power supplies carry the entire load needed for safe shutdown. As
discussed in FSAR subsection 8.6.4.2 a single failure of a 250-volt plant DC power supply is acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At no time will control power be unavailable to the shutdown boards during the system upgrades. The proposed change
will only increase the time allowed to operate the plant while a 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply is
out of service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change allows an additional 40 days to perform system upgrades and results in a small increase in risk.
This small increase in risk is associated with the probability and consequences of a 250-volt plant DC power supply
malfunction while it is supplying shutdown board control power. The increase in risk associated with extending the
AOT was analyzed in a Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) and determined to be approximately 0.3 percent. This
small increase in risk is determined to be insignificant and well within the uncertainty bounds of the PSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change does not change the function of any plant structure, system or component. The proposed change
allows for improvements to the 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply system. The improvements will increase
the capability and reliability of the system. Qualified backup power will be utilized at all times during system modifications.
Only one power supply will be out of service at a time during the modifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The small increase in risk is more than offset by the increased capability, capacity, and reliability of the new power
supplies. Therefore, the power supply modifications will result in a net overall safety benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[The licensee has also committed to implement compensatory measures while performing the power supply modifications.
These measures provide additional confidence that potential accident consequences are not increased.]
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extending the 5-day AOT for the 250-volt shutdown board control power supplies to 45 days does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident, nor does it increase the probability that an accident will occur. The AOT extension
does not involve plant modifications that could create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any of those discussed in the FSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 250-volt DC shutdown board control power supply modifications involve replacement of the existing components
with more reliable, increased capacity equipment having the same functions as before.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change involves a risk increase of approximately 0.3 percent. TVA [the Tennessee Valley Authority,
the licensee] considers this small increase to be insignificant. TVA also considers that the small increase in risk
is offset by the benefits associated with replacing the control power supplies with new, upgraded equipment. Therefore,
the proposed TS change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[The licensee has also committed to implement compensatory measures while performing the power supply modifications.
These measures provide additional capability to mitigate an accident, minimizing any effect on safety margin.]

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would modify Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specification (TS) 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary
Electrical Systems,'' by including an allowed outage time for one of the four connected station battery chargers
and subsequent shutdown requirements. The basis for Section 15.3.7 would also be revised to support the above changes.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the requirements of 10 CFR 50.91(a), Wisconsin Electric Power Company (Licensee) has evaluated
the proposed changes against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that the operation of Point Beach Nuclear
Plant, Units 1 and 2, in accordance with the proposed amendments, does not present a significant hazards consideration.
A proposed facility operating license amendment does not present a significant hazards consideration if operation
of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Create a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will not create a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment allows operation for up to two hours with one out of the four connected station battery chargers
out of service. The 2-hour outage time is based on Regulatory Guide 1.93 and reflects a reasonable time to assess plant
status and either connect an operable battery charger to the affected DC bus or prepare to effect an orderly and safe
shutdown of the operating unit(s). Since the batteries, chargers, and their associated vital instrument buses provide
sufficient redundancy to assure the initiation of proper protective actions during degraded system conditions,
operation of PBNP in accordance with these proposed amendments cannot create an increase in the probability or consequences
of an accident previously evaluated, create a new or different kind of accident, or result in a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. Therefore, the proposed changes do not present a significant hazards consideration.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment revises the Technical Specifications (TSs) by changing the Unit 1 heatup and cooldown pressure-temperature
(P-T) curves (i.e., Figures 3.4-2a and 3.4-3a) to incorporate a newly determined reactor pressure vessel (RPV) reference
nil-ductility temperature, RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This new value of RT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
NDT
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was determined from the licensee's analysis of the first irradiation sample removed from Unit 1. The setpoint curve
contained in Figure 3.4-4a for the Unit 1 Low Temperature Overpressure Protection System (LTOPS) is also revised
to reflect the changes in the P-T curves and to provide a margin for uncertainties in measuring the reactor pressure.
Additionally, the amendment updates the removal schedule of RPV surveillance capsules for both units in accordance
with the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard ASTM E185-82. Finally, the amendment incorporates
an editorial change for Unit 2 in which some clarifying text was added in the Table of Contents to indicate the lifetime
applicability of Figure 3.4-4b for Unit 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the LaSalle County Station, Units 1 and 2 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report Section 11.5.2.1.4
to specify that operator action is required to trip the mechanical vacuum pump upon receipt of a main steam line high
radiation alarm, rather than the action of an automatic trip, which is currently described in the UFSAR. NRC approval
was required because the required operator action, an existing condition, is contrary to that described in the UFSAR
and the NRC's Safety Evaluation Report related to the operation of LaSalle County station (NUREG-0519), and involved
an unreviewed safety question.

Brief description of amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Technical Specifications amendment revised Section 3.1.C.3 and Table 4.1-1 of Appendix A of the Operating License.
These changes require that the reactor coolant average temperature (T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

&cir;F within 15 minutes or be in hot shutdown within the following 15 minutes. Additionally, the change in Table 4.1-1
entitled, ``Minimum Frequencies for Checks, Calibrations and Tests,'' adds the requirement for T

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
avg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 banks are above zero steps. Furthermore, the revision to the Bases indicates that the minimum temperature for criticality
provides assurance that the reactor is operated within the bounds of the safety analyses. Also included is an administrative
change to correct some typographical errors on page 3.1-25 of the Technical Specifications.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revised the Technical Specification (TS) for Combustible Gas Control (3/4.6.4.1) by changing the
surveillance frequency for performing the channel functional test to once-per-quarter and the channel calibration
to once-per-refueling. Also, the TS for the Auxiliary Feedwater System (3/4.7.1.2) were changed to reduce the surveillance
frequency for performing pump operability tests to once-per-quarter on a staggered test basis. These changes are
consistent with the provisions of Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to
Reduce Surveillance Requirements For Testing During Power Operations.''

During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By September
16, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is publishing a document entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Final Report: Principles of Neurotoxicity Risk Assessment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, which was prepared by the Working Party on Neurotoxicology under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Risk Assessment
of the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology (FCCSET). The purpose of this report
is to articulate a view of neurotoxicology that scientists generally hold in common today and to draw on this understanding
to generate a series of general principles that can be used to establish guidelines for assessing neurotoxicity risk.
It is not the intent of this report to provide specific directives for how neurotoxicity risk assessment should be
performed. The intent of this document is to provide the scientific basis for the development of a cogent strategy
for neurotoxicity risk assessment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document is the result of the combined efforts of senior scientists of 13 Federal agencies comprising the ad hoc
Interagency Committee on Neurotoxicology, including the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Center
for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Environmental
Protection Agency, National Center for Toxicological Research, National Institutes of Health, National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, and National Toxicology Program. Discussions were held under the auspices of
the Working Party on Neurotoxicology of the Subcommittee on Risk Assessment of the Federal Coordinating Council
for Science, Engineering, and Technology. The draft report, a product of the Working Party on Neurotoxicology, contains
six chapters: an introduction, an overview of the discipline of neurotoxicology, a review of methods for assessing
human neurotoxicity, a review of methods for assessing animal neurotoxicity, an overview of principles of neurotoxicity
risk assessment, and a general summary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft report was prepared in view of the decision-making processes currently used by many regulatory agencies
relating to neurotoxicity risk assessment. It is intended that the principles reviewed in this document will serve
as the basis for consistent regulatory neurotoxicity guidelines to be used by Federal agencies to meet their respective
legislative mandates. This document is not meant to be used to perform risk assessment nor does it recommend one approach
or strategy. The document reviews the science of neurotoxicology and attempts to formulate general assumptions
and principles that could lead to such approaches or strategies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft report has undergone interagency review under the auspices of the Subcommittee on Risk Assessment of FCCSET.
Public comments received were used in the preparation of the final report by the Working Party on Neurotoxicology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, agencies and programs have been established to deal with hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances, with a focus on deleterious long-term effects, including noncancer endpoints such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as neurotoxicity (Reiter, 1987). Recent evidence indicates that exposure to neurotoxic agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may constitute a significant health problem (WHO, 1986; OTA, 1990; chapter 2). Table 1&hyph;1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lists the four Federal regulatory agencies with authority to regulate either exposure to or use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of chemicals and that require data reporting on assessment of hazards. Regulatory bodies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary greatly in their mandate to require approval of chemicals prior to entering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketplace and to regulate subsequent exposure (Fisher, 1980) (Table 1&hyph;2). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cannot require chemical testing by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer whereas all other agencies can. Only the Food and Drug Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have authority for premarketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing of chemicals (i.e., FDA for drugs and food additives and EPA for pesticides). EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can, under some circumstances, require premarket testing of industrial and agricultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) regulates a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer products including household chemicals and fabric treatments. Laws administered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by CPSC require cautionary labeling on all hazardous household products whether the hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on acute or chronic effects. These laws also provide the authority to ban hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and to ask for data in support of product labeling.

1.2. Purpose of This Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The purpose of this document is to: (1) articulate a view of neurotoxicity that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientists generally hold in common today and (2) draw upon this understanding to compose, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as was done here by senior scientists from a number of Federal agencies, a series of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles that can be used to establish general guidelines for assessing neurotoxicity risk. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not the intent of this report to provide specific directives to agencies with respect to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
own approach for neurotoxicity risk assessment. This document is intended to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific basis for the development of a cogent strategy for neurotoxicology risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as needed by each agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of present gaps in understanding, the principles contained in this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are based on the best judgment of those involved in writing this document, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statements of what is generally accepted as fact. There has been, however, an attempt to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish where possible between the different types of information presented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principles contained in this document can serve as the basis for consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory neurotoxicology guidelines that the Federal agencies can tailor to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the legislative acts they are charged to implement. This document should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viewed broadly as part of an ongoing process within the Federal Government to periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
update and review the current scientific understanding and regulatory utility of neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment.

1.3. Context of This Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This document was prepared in light of a decision-making process used by many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory agencies pertaining to the assessment of neurotoxicity risks posed by chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents. The scientific basis for such assessment can be best understood by examining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision-making process in some detail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk can be thought of as being composed of two aspects, each of which can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by science, i.e., hazard and exposure assessment. Although other definitions have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been used historically, this document conforms to present usage. Hazard generally refers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the toxicity of a substance and is deduced from a wide array of data, including those from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological studies or controlled clinical trials in humans, short- and long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicological studies in animals, and studies of mechanistic information and structure-activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationships. Exposure generally refers to the amount of a substance with which people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
come in contact. The risk in a quantitative risk assessment is estimated by considering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of the exposure and hazard assessments. As either the hazard or exposure approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zero, the risk also approaches zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a first step in assessing the neurotoxic risk associated with the use of a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical substance, the qualitative evidence that a given chemical substance is likely to be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human neurotoxicant must be evaluated. In this step, as in the whole process, a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions and approximations must be made in order to deal with inherent limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the existing data bases. Then, estimates of human exposure and distribution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures likely to be encountered in the population are made. In the absence of dose-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response relationships in humans, one or more methods for estimating the dose-response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship including doses below those generally used experimentally must also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated. Finally, the exposure assessment is combined with the dose-response relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to generate an estimate of risk. The various ways in which these steps are conducted and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined and their attendant uncertainties constitute what is generally referred to as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``neurotoxicity risk assessment.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some legislation calls for action in the presence of any risk. Other forms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislation use the concept of unreasonable risk, defined in some acts as a condition in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risks outweigh the benefits. A spectrum of regulatory responses, from simply informing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public of a risk through restricted use to a complete ban, may be available to bring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risks and benefits into appropriate balance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document does not perform a risk assessment nor does it suggest that one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method of neurotoxicology risk assessment is better than another. Rather, it attempts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review the science of chemical neurotoxicology and develops from this review a set of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general principles. It is not a comprehensive review nor a document written for the lay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public; this document is a semitechnical review that evaluates the impact of scientific findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the last decade on general assumptions or principles important to risk assessment. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the belief that elucidation of the basic mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of neurotoxic agents and conditions, when coupled to research aimed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying and characterizing the problems caused by such agents, should provide the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific bases for making sound and reasonable judgments. These overlapping approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to evaluating the problems of neurotoxicology should form a strong foundation for decision-making.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Including the Introduction (chapter 1), this document contains six chapters. Chapter 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides an overview of the discipline of neurotoxicology. It is important to understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of the problem as it relates to neurotoxicology, including: (1) Definitions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity and adverse effect, (2) examples of neurotoxicity and incidents of exposure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) Federal response to neurotoxicology. Chapter 2 also discusses the basic principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicology that apply generally to the evaluation of neurotoxicity. Issues such as dose, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, target site, and the intended use of the chemical are discussed, as are principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacodynamics, chemical interactions, and the concept of threshold. Chapter 2 also lays 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the neurobiological basis for understanding how and where chemicals can affect the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and provides examples of such chemical types. Finally, chapter 2 discusses special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations for neurotoxicology including the issue of susceptible populations, the blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brain barrier, and the limited capability of the nervous system to repair following chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 3 examines methods for assessing human neurotoxicity. Neurologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations, neuropsychological testing, and applicability of methods used in clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations and case studies are discussed in this chapter. Epidemiologic study designs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints, and methods are also discussed, as well as problems of causal inference and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications and limitations of epidemiologic and field study methods for risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 3 also describes human laboratory exposure studies, including methods for assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral function, self-report methods for assessing subjective states, and a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other methodological issues. This chapter also discusses the comparability of human and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal laboratory methods and special considerations in human neurotoxicity assessments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 4 assesses methods for evaluating animal neurotoxicity. Discussed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chapter is the role that animal models play in the assessment of chemicals for neurotoxicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the validity of animal models, and experimental design considerations in animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicological studies. Also included in this chapter is a discussion of tier-testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches in chemical evaluations. Specific endpoints used in animal neurotoxicological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies are also discussed, including methods for neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuroanatomical, and neurochemical assessments. Developmental neurotoxicology and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vitro neurotoxicology are also described in this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 5 of this document discusses principles of neurotoxicity risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This chapter evaluates the generic assumptions in neurotoxicity risk assessment, ending with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a discussion of uncertainty reduction and identification of knowledge gaps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chapter 6 is a general summary of the material presented in the first five chapters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Chemicals are an integral part of our lives, with the capacity to both improve as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as endanger our health. The general population is exposed to chemicals with neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties in air, water, foods, cosmetics, household products, and drugs used therapeutically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or illicitly. Naturally occurring neurotoxins, such as fish and plant toxins, present other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards. During the daily life of an ordinary person, there is a multitude of exposures, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntary and unintentional, to neuroactive substances. Under conditions of multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures, identifying the substance responsible for an adverse response may be difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA's inventory of toxic chemicals is greater than 65,000 and increasing yearly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerns have been raised about the toxicological data available for many compounds used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercially (NRC, 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not known how many chemicals are neurotoxic to humans. However, estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been made for subsets of substances. A large percentage of the more than 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered active pesticide ingredients are neurotoxic to varying degrees. Of 588 chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed by the American Conference of Government and Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), 167 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected the nervous system or behavior (Anger, 1984; CDC, 1986). Using a generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad definition of neurotoxicity, Anger (1990a) estimated that of the approximately 200 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals to which 1 million or more American workers are exposed, more than one-third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have adverse effects on the nervous system at some level of exposure. Anger (1984) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recognized neurotoxic effects as one of the ten leading workplace disorders. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a number of therapeutic substances, including some anticancer and antiviral agents and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abused drugs, can cause adverse or neurotoxicological side effects (OTA, 1990). It has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated that there is inadequate toxicological information available for more than three-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fourths of the 12,860 chemicals with a production volume of 1 million pounds or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NRC, 1984). It should be noted, however, that estimates concerning the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicants vary widely. O'Donoghue (1989), for example, reported that of 488 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds assessed in his chemical evaluation process, only 2.7% had effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous sytem.

2.1.2. Examples of Neurotoxicity and Incidents of Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
There is a long-standing history associating certain neurological and psychiatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disorders to exposure to a toxin or chemical of an environmental origin (OTA, 1990) (Table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2&hyph;1). Lead is one of the earliest examples of a neurotoxic chemical with widespread 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. This metal is widely distributed with major sources of inorganic lead including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial emissions, lead-based paints, food, beverages, and the burning of leaded gasolines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic lead compounds such as tetraethyl lead have been reported to produce a toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
psychosis (Cassells and Dodds, 1946). If exposure occurs at relatively low levels during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development, lead can cause a variety of neurobehavioral problems, learning disorders, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered mental development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Needleman, 1990). Over the years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government regulations have been developed to decrease human exposure to lead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and as a goal an intervention level of 10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dcl whole blood has been recommended (CDC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991). Lead exposure in the United States has decreased significantly during the last several years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mercury compounds are potent neurotoxic substances and have caused a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human poisonings, with symptoms of vision, speech, and coordination impairments (Chang, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980). Erethism, a syndrome with such neurologic features as tremor and behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms as anxiety, irritability, and pathologic shyness, is seen in people exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elemental mercury (Bidstrup, 1964). One major incidence of human exposure occurred in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mid-1950's when a chemical plant near Minamata Bay, Japan, discharged mercury as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of waste sludge. An epidemic of mercury poisoning developed when the local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhabitants consumed contaminated fish and shellfish. Congenitally affected children 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displayed a progressive neurological disturbance resembling cerebral palsy and manifested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other neurological problems as well. In 1971, an epidemic occurred in Iraq from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methylmercury used as a fungicide to treat grain (OTA, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manganese is used in metal alloys and has been proposed to replace lead in gasoline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is an essential dietary substance for normal body functioning yet parenteral exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manganese can be neurotoxic, producing a dyskinetic motor syndrome similar to Parkinson's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease (Cook et al., 1974). Exposed miners in several countries have suffered from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``manganese madness'' characterized by hallucinations, emotional instability, and numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological problems. Long-term manganese toxicity produces muscle rigidity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staggering gait similar to that seen in patients with Parkinson's disease (Politis et al., 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Parkinsonian-like syndrome was also observed in people who accidentally ingested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Langston et al., 1983). MPTP was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
byproduct of a meperidine derivative sold illicitly as ``synthetic heroin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organic solvents are encountered frequently in occupational settings. Most solvents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are volatile, i.e., they can be converted from a liquid to a gaseous state and readily inhaled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the worker. They are also lipid soluble and readily accumulate in the fat deposits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed organism. An example of a solvent exposure in humans is carbon disulfide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers exposed to high levels of this solvent were found to have an increased frequency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depression and suicide (Seppalainen and Haltia, 1980). Furthermore, repeated exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic solvents is suspected of producing chronic encephalopathy. Workers exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methyl-n-butyl ketone, a dye solvent and cleaning agent, displayed peripheral nervous system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuropathy involving degeneration of nerve fibers (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solvents including ether, ketones, alcohols, and various combinations are commonly used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glues, cements, and paints and when inhaled can be neurotoxic. Repeated abuse of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents can lead to permanent neurological effects due to severe and permanent loss of nerve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells (OTA, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pesticides are one of the most commonly encountered classes of neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances. These can include insecticides (used to control insects), fungicides (for blight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and mildew), rodenticides (for rodents such as rats, mice, and gophers), and herbicides (to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control weeds). Active ingredients are combined with so-called inert substances to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thousands of different pesticide formulations. Workers who are overexposed to pesticides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may display obvious signs of poisoning, including tremors, weakness, ataxia, visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disturbances, and short-term memory loss (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Chlordecone exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in nervousness and tremors (Cannon et al., 1978). The organophosphorous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insecticides have neurotoxic properties and account for approximately 40 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registered pesticides. A delayed neurotoxicity can be seen as a result of exposure to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organophosphate pesticides, producing irreversible loss of motor function and an associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuropathology (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to interfere with a specific enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Davis and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Richardson, 1980). Paralysis has also been reported following consumption of nonpesticide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organophosphate products such as tri-o-cresylphosphate (TOCP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxicities in humans, domestic livestock, and poultry associated with fungal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxins (mycotoxins) have been well documented (Kurata, 1990; Aibara, 1986; Wyllie and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Morehouse, 1978). Mycotoxins not only have a negative economic effect on animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, but they also represent a definite threat to human health. Mycotoxins occur in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forages, field crops, and grains used for livestock; they also are incorporated into cereals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grains, and grain-based products used for human consumption. Therefore, human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may occur either through direct consumption of these products or secondarily through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of meat, milk, or eggs. An example of human exposure to fungal toxins is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-infected wheat, barley, and oats used for bread and as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietary supplement for livestock. These fungal toxins are notorious for producing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gangrenous and convulsive forms of the disease known as ``ergotism'' (Bove, 1970). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fungi are in the family 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clavicipitaceae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and produce a group of compounds known as ergot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alkaloids, which have neurotropic, uterotonic, and vasoconstrictive activities. They may act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as dopamine agonists or serotonin antagonists, and also block alpha-adrenergic receptors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there are numerous naturally occurring ergot alkaloids, this represents only part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their pharmacopoeia (Berde and Schield, 1978). These alkaloids are highly toxic and cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both acute and chronic poisonings. Although guidelines now limit the amount of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Claviceps
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-contaminated, or ``ergot''-contaminated, grains, these compounds may enter human food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources through secondary mechanisms. Other fungi associated with ergot-like syndromes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
livestock include

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This mycotoxin is suspected of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causing ``kodua poisoning'' in humans who consumed kodo millet seed in India (Rao and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Husain, 1985). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Fusarium moniliforme
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a common fungal infection in corn (Bacon et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992) and directly related to neurotoxic syndrome in horses known as equine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leukoencephalomalaisia (ELEM). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Natural plant toxins also represent a health risk to both livestock and humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Movement toward limited uses of herbicides, fungicides, and no-till agricultural practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the possibility of noxious weeds and weed seeds being incorporated into food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Ergot alkaloids also are produced by morning glories 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(Ipomea violacea)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be incorporated into soybeans, corn, peas, etc., during harvest. Export regulations limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morning glory-contaminated soybeans because of the hallucinogenic and other effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by ergot alkaloids. Jimson weed

have parasympatholytic (anticholinergic) activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2.1.3. Federal Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the United States, several agencies, including EPA, FDA, OSHA, CPSC, NIOSH, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ATSDR, have been given the mandate to regulate or evaluate public exposure to toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals (Tilson, 1989).

2.1.3.1. Food and Drug Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDA has the authority to regulate the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food and color additives as well as to determine whether or not various foods are unsafe for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human consumption because of adulteration by environmental contaminants. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer must supply adequate data to establish the safety of the food additives. Before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketing approval, the potential toxicity of proposed food and color additives is established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a battery of animal toxicity studies. During all of these studies, clinical signs of toxicity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including abnormal behavior, are monitored and abnormalities recorded. At the termination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these studies, tissues from all organs, including the brain, are sectioned and evaluated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both gross and histopathological changes, in addition to being evaluated for their clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemistry and hematology. None of the routinely required tests is specifically designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess neurotoxicity. If neurotoxic effects are detected during any of the standard toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests, however, they must be reported. Specific neurotoxicity testing may then be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA is currently revising its guidelines for the safety assessment of direct food and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
color additives to include neurotoxicity as a routine element in toxicological testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA is also authorized to regulate substances in food considered to be poisonous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or deleterious. Unavoidable environmental contaminants in food fall into this category. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA determines a level at which the risks from realistically possible intakes are negligible or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable. Based on this risk assessment, an action level or tolerance is established. Once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the action level or tolerance is formally established, the FDA may take appropriate action to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrict adulterated food from the market if these standards are exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA is responsible for assessing the toxicity of human therapeutic products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many products have been shown to produce adverse effects on the nervous system at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard therapeutic doses as well as at higher doses. Before marketing approval is given, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the toxicity of potential new products is assessed. A battery of animal toxicity study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters relevant to the nervous system, including gross behavioral observation and gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and histopathological examination of the nervous tissue, are evaluated. This information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to help guide the surveillance of human subjects for adverse effects that are assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during clinical trials.

2.1.3.2. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA has been given the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility to ensure that the working environment is a safe and healthy place of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment. In the early 1970's, OSHA adopted the existing Federal standards, most of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which were developed under the Walsh-Healy Act (including the 1968 ACGIH Threshold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limit Values), and approximately 20 consensus standards of the American National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards Institute (ANSI) as Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs). Of the 393 remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original PELs, 145 were set in part to protect the individual from neurotoxic effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the adoption of the initial standards, OSHA has issued new or revised health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards or work practices for 23 substances. Of these, the one concerning lead was based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in part on nervous system effects. Four other compounds, inorganic arsenic, acrylonitrile, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethylene oxide, and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane, were cited as causing various disturbances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the nervous system, but the standards for these were based primarily on carcinogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, OSHA updated 428 exposure limits for air contaminants. Of these, 25 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances were categorized by OSHA as ``substances for which limits are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``substances for which limits are based on avoidance of narcosis.'' However, OSHA stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the categorization was intended as a tool to manage the large number of substances being

regulated and not to imply that the category selected identified the most sensitive or the

exclusive adverse health effects of that substance.

The Occupational Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Health Act established NIOSH as a Public Health Service (PHS) agency to develop and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommend criteria for prevention of disease and hazardous conditions in the workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIOSH also performs research on occupational health issues and conducts worksite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations of suspected hazards. OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health Administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MSHA) use NIOSH recommendations in the promulgation of new or revised health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing recommended exposure limits (RELs) for chemicals, NIOSH examines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all relevant scientific information about a given compound and attempts to identify exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits that will protect all workers from adverse effects. NIOSH has recommended standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for approximately 644 chemicals or classes of chemicals. For 214 (33 percent) of these, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity was cited as a health effect considered when formulating the REL (NIOSH, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992).

The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) provide the legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority for EPA to require data collection for premarket approval of chemicals. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5 of TSCA, after a manufacturer has notified EPA of its plans to produce a ``new'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical that has not yet been listed on the inventory, EPA has the responsibility to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible health hazards. Potential neurotoxicity is included in the health hazards assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are reasons to suspect neurotoxicologic effects (e.g., from structure-activity analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the literature, or data submitted by the manufacturer), EPA can issue a test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule requiring the manufacturer to develop data directed toward these effects. At the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, EPA can restrict the chemical or prohibit it entirely from entering commerce until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required data are submitted and reviewed. In addition, for ``old'' chemicals (under section 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of TSCA), if EPA suspects neurotoxicity, a test rule would be the mechanism used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining the data. Many other statutes provide authority to regulate chemicals through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting of standards, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxicity is recognized as a health effect of concern under FIFRA, and there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity testing requirements for premarketing submission of data to EPA for

registration of a pesticide under FIFRA.

ATSDR has a mission to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent or mitigate adverse effects to both human health and the quality of life resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to hazardous substances in the environment. The ATSDR publishes a National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority List (NPL) of hazardous substances that are found at National Priority Waste Sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The order of priority is based on an algorithm, taking into consideration frequency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which substances are found at NPL sites, toxicity, and potential for human exposure; this list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is reranked on a yearly basis. So far, 129 toxicological profiles have been developed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority hazardous substances, and 92 substances have a profile with a neurological health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect endpoint (HAZDAT, 1992). Neurotoxicity has been selected by the ATSDR to be one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the seven high-priority health conditions resulting from exposure to environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicants.

2.2.1. Basic Toxicological Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A chemical must enter the body, reach the tissue target site(s), and be maintained at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient concentration for a period of time in order for an adverse effect to occur. Not all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals have the same level of toxicity; some may be very toxic in small amounts while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others may have little effect even at extremely high amounts. Thus, the dose-response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship is a major concept in determining the toxicity of a specific substance. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors in determining toxicity include the physical and chemical properties of the substance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the route and level of exposure, the susceptibility of the target tissue, and the health, gender, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and age of the exposed individual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the toxic substance has entered the body, usually through the lungs (inhalation), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the skin (absorption), or the gastrointestinal tract (ingestion), it is partitioned into various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body tissues where it can act on its target sites. The substance is eliminated from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bloodstream by the process of accumulation into the various sites in the body, with the liver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and kidney being major sites of accumulation of toxic substances. This is thought to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with these organs' large blood capacity and major role in elimination of substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the body. Lipophilic chemicals accumulate in lipid-rich areas of the body and present a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant potential problem for the nervous system. The nervous system is unique in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high percentage content of lipid (50 percent of dry weight) and may be particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerable to such chemicals. The site or sites of accumulation for a specific toxic substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may or may not be the primary sites of action. Examples include two known neurotoxicants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon monoxide in the red blood cells and lead in the bone. It must be noted that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances are not distributed throughout the body, partially as a function of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insolubility, polarity, or molecular weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect that a substance has will generally depend on the body burden or level in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tissue and duration of exposure. The time course of the levels is determined by several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, including the amount at time of exposure, duration of exposure, and metabolic fate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the chemical. The study of such metabolic processes, pharmacokinetics, has demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complex patterns in the absorption, distribution, possible biotransformation, and elimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of various substances (Klaassen, 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many substances are removed by the kidney and excreted through the urine. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liver can detoxify substances like organic lead, which are excreted from the liver into the bile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and then the small intestines, bypassing the blood and kidney. Lipophilic toxic substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are primarily removed from the body through feces and bile, and water-soluble metabolites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are removed in the urine, through the skin, and through expiration into the air. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biotransformation is a biochemical process that converts a substance into a different chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound, allowing it to be excreted more easily. Substances are more easily removed if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are biotransformed into a more hydrophilic compound. Biotransformation can either aid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the detoxification of a substance or produce a more toxic metabolite. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original substance may not be the substance that is producing the toxicity on the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system or any other system. Thus, several factors must be taken into consideration when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluating the potential neurotoxicity of a chemical. They include the pharmacokinetics of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the parent compound, the target tissue concentrations of the parent chemical or its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or metabolite into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cell and/or membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical or metabolite with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumed receptor sites.

2.2.2. Basic Neurotoxicological Principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurotoxicity can be manifest as a structural or functional adverse response of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system to a chemical, biological, or physical agent (Tilson, 1990b). It is a function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both the property of the agent and a property of the nervous system itself. Neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers broadly to the adverse neural responses following exposure to chemical or physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents (e.g., radiation) (Tilson, 1990b). Adverse effects include any change that diminishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability to survive, reproduce, or adapt to the environment. Neuroactive substances may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also impair health indirectly by altering behavior in such a way that safety is decreased in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of numerous activities. Toxicity can occur at any time in the life cycle, from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conception through senescence, and its manifestations can change with age. The range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses can vary from temporary responses following acute exposures to delayed responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following acute or chronic exposure to persistent responses. Neurotoxicity may or may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reversible following cessation of exposure. The responses may be graded from transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to fatal and there may be different responses to the same neurotoxicant at different dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels but similar responses to exposure to different agents. Displays of a neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response may be progressive in nature, with small deficits occurring early in exposure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing to become more severe over time. Expression of neurotoxicity can encompass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple levels of organization and complexity including structural, biochemical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physiological, and behavioral measurements.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Caution must be exercised in labeling a substance neurotoxic. The intended use and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of the chemical, the dose, exposure scenario and whether or not the chemical acts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly or indirectly on the nervous system, must be taken into consideration. A substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may be neurotoxic at a high concentration may be safe and beneficial at a lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration. For example, vitamin A, vitamin B6, are required in the diet in trace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts, yet all result in neurotoxicity when consumed in large quantities. Pharmaceutical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents may also have adverse effects at high dose levels or where the beneficial effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outweigh the adverse side effects. For example, antipsychotic drugs have allowed many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people suffering from schizophrenia to lead relatively normal lives; however, chronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed use of some of these drugs may result in severe tardive dyskinesia characterized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, and limbs. Other examples include toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuropathies induced by chemotherapeutic agents like cis-platinum, toxic anticholinergic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of high doses of tricyclic antidepressants, disabling movement disorders in patients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated with anti-Parkinsonian agents and major tranquilizers, and hearing loss and balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disruption triggered by certain antibacterials (Sterman and Schaumburg, 1980). Drugs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse such as ethanol also have neurotoxic potential. Opiates such as heroin may lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dependence, which is considered to be a long-term adverse alteration of nervous system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning. Simultaneous exposure to drugs or toxic agents may produce toxic interactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either in the environment or occupational settings. For example, exposure to noise and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain antibiotics can exacerbate the loss of hearing function (Boettcher et al., 1987; Lim, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986; Bhattacharyya and Dayal, 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nervous system is a highly complex and integrated organ. It is possible that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonlinear dose-response relationships or a threshold effect could exist for some agents. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been hypothesized that the nervous system has a reserve capacity that masks subtle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage and any exposure that does not overcome this reserve capacity may not reach the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold and no observable impairment will be evident (Tilson and Mitchell, 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the functional reserve may be depleted over time and the manifestations of toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be delayed in relationship to the exposure. The reserve may be depleted by a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors including aging, stress, or chronic exposure to an environmental insult, in which case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning will eventually be impaired and toxicity will become apparent. If a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events occur simultaneously, the response is progressive in nature, or there is a long latency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between exposure and manifestation of toxicity, the identification of a single cause of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional impairment may not be possible.

2.3.1. Structure of the Nervous System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nervous system is composed of two parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). Within the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, there exist predominantly two general types of cells_nerve cells (neurons) and glial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells. Neurons have many of the same structures found in every cell of the body; they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unique, however, in that they have axons and dendrites, extensions of the neuron along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which nerve impulses travel. The structure of the neuron consists of a cell body, 10 to 100 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
m in diameter, containing a nucleus and organelles for the synthesis of various components 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for the cell's functioning, e.g., proteins and lipids. There are numerous branch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patterns of elongated processes, the dendrites, that emanate from the cell body and increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the neuronal surface area available to receive inputs from other sources. Neurons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicate with each other by releasing chemical signals onto specific surface regions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receptors, of the other neuron. The axon is a process specialized for the conduction of nerve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impulses away from the cell toward the terminal synapses and eventually toward other cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(neurons, muscle cells, or gland cells). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurons are responsible for the reception, integration, transmission, and storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information (Raine, 1989). Certain nerve cells are specialized to respond to particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimuli. For example, chemoreceptors in the mouth and nose send information about taste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smell to the brain. Cutaneous receptors in the skin are involved in the sensation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure, pain, heat, cold, and touch. In the retina, the rods and cones sense light. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, the length of the axon is tens to thousands of times greater than the cell body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diameter. For example, the cell body whose processes innervate the muscles in the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foot is found in the spinal cord at the level of the middle back. The axons of these cells are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than a meter in length. Many, but not all, axons are surrounded by the layers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membrane from the cytoplasmic process of glial cells. These layers are called myelin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheaths and are composed mostly of lipid. In the PNS, the myelin sheaths are formed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schwann cells, while in the CNS the sheaths are formed by the oligodendroglia. The myelin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheath formed by one glial cell covers only a short length of the axon. The entire length of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the axon is ensheathed in myelin by numerous glial cells. Between adjacent glial sheaths, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very short length of bare axon exists called the node of Ranvier. In unmyelinated axons, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nerve impulse must travel in a continuous fashion down the entire length of the nerve. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of myelin accelerates the nerve impulse by up to 100 times by allowing the impulse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to jump from one node to the next in a process called ``saltatory conduction.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nerve cells of the PNS are generally found in aggregates called ganglia. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brain and spinal cord make up the CNS and the neurons are segregated into functionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related aggregates called nuclei. They synthesize and secrete neurotransmitters, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specialized chemical messengers that interact with receptors of other neurons in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communication process. Various nuclei together with the interconnecting bundles of axonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibers are functionally related to one another to form higher levels of organization called 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. For example, there is the motor system, the visual system, and the limbic system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the base of the brain, several small nuclei in the hypothalamus form the neuroendocrine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system, which plays a critical role in the control of the body's endocrine (hormone-secreting) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glands. Nerve cells in the hypothalamus secrete chemical messengers into a short loop of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blood vessels that carries the messengers to the pituitary gland which, in turn, releases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical messengers into the general circulation. These pituitary messengers regulate other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
glands (e.g., the thymus and the gonads). The entire system maintains a state of optimal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physiological function for all of the body's organ systems.

2.3.2. Transport Processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All types of cells must transport proteins and other molecular components from their site of production near the nucleus
to the other sites in the cell (Hammerschlag and Brady, 1989). Neurons are unique in that the neuronal cell body must
maintain not only the functions normally associated with its own support, but it must also provide support to its various
processes. This support may require transport of material over relatively vast distances. Delivery of necessary
substances by intracellular transport down the axon (axonal transport) represents a supply line that is highly vulnerable
to interruption by toxic chemicals. In addition, the integrity of the function of the neuronal cell body is often dependent
on a supply of trophic factors from the cells that it innervates. These factors are continually supplied to the neural
cells by the process of retrograde axonal transport, often as a process of normal exchange between two or more cells.
They play a significant factor in the normal growth and maintenance of the neural cells, and a continual supply of certain
trophic factors is necessary for cell functioning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of axonal transport occurs along longitudinally arranged fiber tracks called neurofilaments. This
movement along neurofilaments requires energy in the form of oxidative metabolism. Toxicants that interfere with
this metabolism or that disrupt the spatial arrangement or production of neurofilaments may block axonal transport
and can produce neuropathy (Lowndes and Baker, 1980). This can be seen following exposure to many substances, such
as n-hexane and methyl n-butyl ketone as well as the drugs vincristine, vinblastine, and taxol. Acrylamide produces
a dying-back axonopathy but by an alternative mechanism involving altered axonal transport.

2.3.3. Ionic Balance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The axonal membrane is semipermeable to positively and negatively charged ions (mostly potassium, sodium, and chloride)
within and outside of the axon. There are several enzyme systems that maintain an ionic balance that changes following
depolarization of the membrane (Davies, 1968). This is maintained only by the continual active transport of ions
across the membrane, which requires an expenditure of energy. The nerve impulse is a traveling wave of depolarization
normally originating from the cell body; however, in sensory neurons it originates at the terminal receptive end
of specialized axons (Davies, 1968). The wave is continued by openings in the membrane that allow ions to rush into
the axon. This sudden change in the charge across the axon's membrane is the nerve impulse. It is an amplified depolarization
that reaches the threshold value and spreads down the axon from one length to another until the next length of membrane
reaches the threshold value. It continues in this fashion until it reaches the synaptic terminal regions. There are
a number of varieties of membrane channels (e.g., calcium) that rapidly open and close during impulse generation;
the common ones are the sodium and potassium channels. They are very small and allow only ions of a certain size to pass.
Several classes of drugs (e.g., local anesthetics) and natural toxins (e.g., tetrodotoxin) inhibit nerve impulse
conduction by blocking these channels.

2.3.4. Neurotransmission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terminal branches of the axon end in small enlargements called synaptic ``boutons.'' It is from these boutons
that chemical messengers will be released in order to communicate with the target cell at the point of interaction,
the synapse (Hammerschlag and Brady, 1989). When the nerve impulse reaches the terminal branches of the axon, it depolarizes
the synaptic boutons. This depolarization causes the release of the chemical messengers (neurotransmitters and
neuromodulators) stored in vesicles in the axon terminal (Willis and Grossman, 1973). Classical neurotransmitters
include serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine and are typically secreted by one neuron into the
synaptic cleft where they are on the postsynaptic membrane. Neuropeptides, however, may travel long distances through
the bloodstream to receptors on distant nerve cells or in other tissues. Following depolarization, the amount of
secretion is dependent on the number of nerve impulses that reach the synaptic bouton, i.e., the degree of depolarization.
The chemical messengers diffuse across the synaptic cleft or into the intraneuronal space and bind to receptors on
adjacent nerve cells or effector organs, thus triggering biochemical events that lead to electrical excitation
or inhibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When information is transmitted from nerves to muscle fibers, the point of interaction is called the neuromuscular
junction and the interaction leads to contraction or relaxation of the muscle. When the target is a gland cell, the
interaction leads to secretion. Synaptic transmission between neurons is slightly more complicated, but still
dependent on the opening and closing of ion channels in the membrane. The binding of the messenger to the receptor of
the receiving cell can lead to either the excitation or inhibition of the target cell. At an excitatory synapse, the
neurotransmitter-receptor interaction leads to an opening in certain ion-specific channels. The charged ions
that move through these opened chambers carry a current that serves to depolarize the cell membranes. At inhibitory
synapses, the interaction leads to an opening in a different type of ion-specific channel that produces an increase
in the level of polarization (hyperpolarization). The sum of all the depolarizing and hyperpolarizing currents
determines the transmembrane potential and when a threshold level of depolarization is reached at the axon's initial
segment, a nerve impulse is generated and begins to travel down the axon.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The duration of neurotransmitter action is primarily a function of the length of time it remains in the synaptic cleft.
This duration is very short due to specialized enzymes that quickly remove the transmitter either by degrading it
or by reuptake systems that transport it back into the synaptic bouton. A toxic substance may disrupt this process
in several different ways. It is important that the duration of the effect of synaptically released chemical messengers
be limited. Some neurotoxicants, e.g., cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorous pesticides, inhibit the
enzyme (AChE), which serves to terminate the effect of the neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) on its target. The result
is an overstimulation of the target cell. Other substances, particularly biological toxins, are able to interact
with the receptor molecule and mimic the action of the neurotransmitter. Some toxic substances, like neuroactive
pharmaceuticals, may interfere with the synthesis of a particular neurotransmitter, while others may block the
neurotransmitter's access to its receptor molecule.

2.4. Types of Effects on the Nervous System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The normal activity of the nervous system can be altered by many toxic substances. A variety of adverse health effects
can be seen ranging from impairment of muscular movement to disruption of vision and hearing to memory loss and hallucinations
(WHO, 1986; Anger, 1984, 1990). Toxic substances can alter both the structure and the function of cells in the nervous
system. Structural alterations include changes in the morphology of the cell and its subcellular structures. In
some cases, agents produce neuropathic conditions that resemble naturally occurring neurodegenerative disorders
in humans (Calne et al., 1986). Cellular alterations can include the accumulation, proliferation, or rearrangement
of structural elements (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules) or organelles (mitochondria) as well as the
breakdown of cells. By affecting the biochemistry and/or physiology of a cell, a toxic substance can alter the internal
environment of any neural cell. Intracellular changes can result from oxygen deprivation (anoxia) because neurons
require relatively large quantities of oxygen due to their high metabolic rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many times the response of the nervous system to a toxic substance can be a slow degeneration of the nerve cell body or
axon that may result in permanent neuronal damage. Substances can act as a cytotoxicant after having been transported
into the nerve terminal. A complete loss of nerve cells can occur following exposure to a number of toxic substances.
Sensory nerve cells may be lost following treatment with megavitamin doses of vitamin B6; hippocampal neurons undergo
degeneration with trimethyltin and trimethyl lead poisoning; motor nerve cells are affected in cycad toxicity,
which has been loosely linked to Guam-ALS-Parkinsonism dementia. Acute carbon monoxide poisoning can produce a
delayed, progressive deterioration over a period of weeks of portions of the nervous system that may lead to psychosis
and death. Substances such as mercury and lead can cause central nervous system dysfunction. In children, mercury
intoxication can cause degeneration of neurons in the cerebellum and can lead to tremors, difficulty in walking,
visual impairment, and even blindness. Lead affects the cortex of the immature brain, resulting in mental retardation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the cellular level, a substance might interfere with cellular processes like protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synthesis, leading to a reduced production of neurotransmitters and brain dysfunction (Bondy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985). Nicotine and some insecticides mimic the effects of the neurotransmitter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acetylcholine. Organophosphorous compounds, carbamate insecticides, and nerve gases act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by inhibiting AChE, the enzyme that inactivates the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in a buildup of acetylcholine and can lead to loss of appetite, anxiety, muscle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
twitching, and paralysis. Amphetamines stimulate the nervous system by releasing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blocking reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from nerve cells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cocaine affects the release and reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs can cause paranoia, hyperactivity, aggression, high blood pressure, and abnormal heart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rhythms. Opium-related drugs such as morphine and heroin act at specific opioid receptors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the brain, producing sedation, euphoria, and analgesia. They also tend to slow the heart 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate and cause nausea, convulsions, and slow breathing patterns. Other substances can alter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the synthesis and release of specific neurotransmitters and activate their receptors in specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuronal pathways. They may perturb the system by overstimulating receptors, blocking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitter release and/or inhibiting transmitter degradation, or blocking reuptake of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotransmitter precursors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also at the cellular level, the flow of ions such as calcium, sodium, and potassium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across the cell membrane may be changed and the transmission of information between nerve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells altered. A substance may interfere with the ionic balance of a neuron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides produce autonomic dysfunction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organochlorine insecticides increase sensorimotor sensitivity, produce tremors and in some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases cause seizures and convulsions (Ecobichon and Joy, 1982). Lindane, DDT, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pyrethroids, and trimethyltin also produce convulsions. Conversely, solvents act to raise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold for eliciting seizures or act to reduce the severity or duration of the elicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convulsions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The role of excitatory amino acid (EAA)-mediated synaptic activation is critical for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal function of the CNS. Because endogenous EAA-mediated synaptic transmission is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widespread excitatory system in the brain and is involved in the process of learning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
memory, the issue of the effects of endogenous and exogenous EAA-related toxicity has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad implications for both CNS morbidity and mortality in humans. Much of the injury and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuronal death associated with toxicity is mediated by receptors for excitatory amino acids, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially glutamic acid. When applied in sufficient excess from either endogenous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exogenous sources, EAAs have profound neurotoxic effects that can result in the destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of neurons and, as a consequence, lead to acute phase confusion, seizures, and generalized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weakness or to persistent impairments such as memory loss (Choi, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A final common path in the activation of these receptor classes is an increase in free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cytosolic Ca

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that can result in the release and activation of intracellular enzymes (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
break down the cytoskeleton) and in further release of glutamate, both of which can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cytotoxic (Choi, 1988). Critical to an understanding of the etiopathology associated with at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least some of the neurotoxic degeneration may be the link that impaired energy metabolism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have with excitotoxic neuronal death. It is likely that reduced oxidative metabolism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in the partial depolarization of resting membrane potential, the activation of ionotropic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membrane receptor/channels, and the influx of Ca

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nervous system is dependent on an extensive system of blood vessels and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capillaries to deliver large quantities of oxygen and nutrients as well as to remove toxic waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Damage to the capillaries in the brain can lead to the swelling characteristic of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encephalopathy. This can be seen following exposure to higher concentrations of lead. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other metals (e.g., cadmium, thallium, and mercury) and organotin (e.g., trimethyltin) cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rupturing of vessels that can also result in encephalopathy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One large aspect of function that may be affected by neurotoxicants is behavior, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is the product of various sensory, motor, and associative functions of the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Neurotoxic substances can adversely affect sensory or motor functions, disrupt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learning and memory processes, or cause detrimental behavioral effects; however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying mechanisms for these effects have yet to be determined. Although changes may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be subtle, the assessment of behavior may serve as a robust means of monitoring the well-being of the organism (Tilson
and Cabe, 1978).

2.5.1. Susceptible Populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Everyone is at a certain level of risk of being adversely affected by neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances. Individuals of certain age groups, health states, and occupations, however, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be at a greater level of risk. Fetuses, children, the elderly, workers in occupations involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to relatively high levels of toxic chemicals, and persons who abuse drugs are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among those in high-risk groups. Neurotoxic substances may exacerbate existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological or psychiatric disorders in a population. Although controversial (Waddell, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993), recent evidence suggests that there may be a subpopulation of people who have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become sensitive to chemicals and experience adverse reactions to low-level exposures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental chemicals (Bell, et al., 1992). Confounded in all of these groups is the role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that nutrition plays in the response of the organism to exposure. Both general nutritional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status and specific nutritional deficiencies (for example, protein, iron, and calcium) can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly influence the response to a toxic substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is widely accepted that during development adverse effects can result from exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to some chemicals at lower levels than would be necessary for the average adult (Suzuki, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1980). The developing nervous system appears to be differentially sensitive to some kinds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage (Cushner, 1981; Pearson and Dietrich, 1985; Annau and Eccles, 1986; Hill and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennyson, 1986; Silbergeld, 1986). During the developmental period, the nervous system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actively growing and establishing intricate cellular networks. Both the blood-brain and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blood-nerve barriers that will eventually protect much of the adult brain, spinal cord, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peripheral nerves are incomplete. The protective mechanisms by which the organism deals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with toxic substances, such as the detoxification systems, are not fully developed. Exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to chemicals during development can result in a range of effects. At the highest exposure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects include death, gross structural abnormalities, or altered growth. Larger populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are generally exposed to more moderate levels resulting in more subtle functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairments. The qualitative nature of some injuries during development may differ from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those seen in the adult, such as changes in tissue volume, misplaced or misoriented neurons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or delays or acceleration of the appearance of functional or structural endpoints (Rodier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986). In many cases, the results of early injuries may become evident only as the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system matures and ages (Rodier, 1990). There are several instances in which functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alterations have resulted from exposure during the period between conception and sexual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maturity (Riley and Vorhees, 1986; Vorhees, 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Early exposure to relatively low levels of lead can result in reduced scores on tests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mental development (Bellinger et al., 1987; Needleman, 1990). Early gestational exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to neurotoxicants such as cocaine can produce long-term neurobehavioral abnormalities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Anderson-Brown et al., 1990; Hutchings et al., 1989); heavy alcohol exposure produces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
craniofacial abnormalities and mental retardation (Jones and Smith, 1973), while moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of alcohol consumption during gestation can delay motor development (Little et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With aging, the level of risk for a number of health-related factors increases; it has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been hypothesized that the risk for toxic perturbations to the nervous system also increases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with age (Weiss, 1990). It is generally believed that with increasing age comes a decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the nervous system to respond to adverse events or to compensate for either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological, physical, or toxic effects. At the tissue and cellular level, the aging process can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in nerve cell loss, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (abnormal accumulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain filamentous proteins) and neuritic plaques (abnormal clusters of proteins and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances near synapses). As cells die, the complex neuronal circuitry of the brain becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impaired. Neurotransmitter concentrations and the enzymes involved in their synthesis may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be altered. Some axons can gradually lose their myelin sheath, resulting in a slowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduction of nerve impulses along the axon. It has been postulated that with age, not only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might the nervous system become more susceptible to new insults, but the effects of previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures also may become evident, with a diminished capacity for compensation (Weiss, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). The increased incidence of multiple drug-taking in the elderly population might also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead to interactions, either drug/drug or drug/chemical, which can adversely affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system. Nutritionally, the aged experience increased incidences of both general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undernutrition and deficits of specific nutrients such as iron or calcium, which might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the response to toxic substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the geriatric population, the clinical manifestation of neurodegenerative disorders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have a contributing component of past exposures to environmental chemical agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Calne et al. (1986) hypothesized that various agents contribute to Alzheimer's disease, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parkinson's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, motoneurone disease, or Lou 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gehrig's disease) by depleting neuronal reserves to an extent that perturbations become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observable in the context of the natural aging process. B-N-methylamino-L-alanine, from the

amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Spencer et al., 1987). Alzheimer-type syndromes have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported in individuals occupationally exposed to organic solvents or metal vapors (Freed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kandel, 1988). Severe cognitive dysfunction has been noted in Alzheimer's disease and

At any age, preexisting physical as well as mental disorders of the individual may play a significant role in the manifestation
of a toxic response following exposure to a potentially toxic substance. Both types of disorders compromise the system
in some way so that either the defense mechanisms of the organism are not able to deal with the toxic substance or are
not able to repair themselves quickly. In addition to the basic altered biology, for individuals with a physical or
mental disorder who are under some form of medical intervention, the combination of therapeutic drugs and toxic substances
may have an interactive effect on the nervous system. For example, due to the delicate electrochemical balance of
the nervous system, mental disorders may be exacerbated by exposure to a toxic substance.

2.5.2. Blood-Brain and Blood-Nerve Barriers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bioavailability of a specific chemical to the nervous system is a function of both the target tissue and the chemical.
The brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves are surrounded by a series of semipermeable tissues referred to as the
blood-brain and blood-nerve barriers (Katzman, 1976; Peters et al., 1991). In the central nervous system, the blood-brain
barrier is composed of tight junctions formed by endothelial cells and astrocytes. These tight junctions and cellular
interactions forming the barrier restrict the free passage of most bloodborne substances. By doing this, they create
a finely controlled extracellular environment for the nerve cells. Certain regions of the brain and nerves are directly
exposed to chemicals in the blood because the barrier is not present in some areas of the nervous system. For example,
it is absent in the circumventricular area, around the dorsal root ganglion in the peripheral nervous system, and
around the olfactory nerve, which may allow chemicals to penetrate directly from the nasal region to the frontal cortex.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of these blood-brain and blood-nerve barriers suggests that proper functioning of the nervous system
is dependent on control of the substances to which nerve cells are exposed. The term ``barrier,'' however, is somewhat
of a misnomer. Although water-soluble and polar compounds enter the brain poorly, lipophilic substances readily
cross the barrier. In addition, a series of specific transport mechanisms exist through which required nutrients
(hormones, amino acids, peptides, proteins, fatty acids, etc.) reach the brain (Pardridge, 1988). If toxicants
are lipid soluble or if they are structurally similar to substances that are normally transported into the brain,
they can achieve high concentrations in brain tissue. It has been proposed that one reason why the developing nervous
system may be differentially sensitive to some toxicants is that the blood-brain barrier is less effective than in
an adult. The effectiveness of the blood-brain barrier may also be changed by chemical-induced physiological events
such as metabolic acidosis and nutritional deprivation.

2.5.3. Metabolism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The central nervous system has a very high metabolic rate and, unlike other organs, the brain depends almost entirely
on glucose as a source of energy and raw material for the synthesis of other molecules (Damstra and Bondy, 1980). The
absence of an alternative energy source makes the CNS critically dependent on an uninterrupted supply of oxygen as
well as the proper functioning of enzymes that metabolize glucose. Substances can be toxic to the nervous system if
they perturb neuronal metabolism. Without glucose, nerve cells usually begin to die within minutes. Despite its
relatively small size, the energy demands of the brain require 14 percent of the heart's output and consumes about
18 percent of the oxygen absorbed by the lungs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2.5.4. Limited Regenerative Ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The nervous system has a combination of special features not found in other organ systems. It is composed of a variety
of metabolically active neurons and supporting cell types that interact through a multitude of complex chemical
mechanisms. Each cell type has its own functions and vulnerabilities. At the time of puberty, the system is fully developed
and neurogenesis (the birth of new neurons from cell division of precursor cells called neuroblasts) ceases. This
is in marked and significant contrast to almost all other tissues, where cell replacement is continual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is this loss of neurogenesis that limits the nervous system's ability to recover from damage and influences the
plasticity of the system. Neurons are unable to regenerate following damage; therefore, they are no longer able to
perform their normal functions. Toxic damage to the brain or spinal cord that results in cell loss is usually permanent.
If nerve cell loss is concentrated in one of the CNS's functional subsystems, the outcome could be debilitating; for
example, a relatively small loss of neurons that use acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter may produce a profound
disturbance of memory. A relatively minor insult concentrated in a subsystem that relies on dopamine as its neurotransmitter
may drastically impair motor coordination. However, in response to injury, neurons are able to show considerable
plasticity both during development and after maturation. Damage to the nervous system alters connectivity between
the surviving neurons, permitting functional adjustments to occur to compensate for the damage. Such responsiveness
may, in and of itself, have profound consequences for neurological, behavioral, and related body functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After damage to axons in the peripheral nerves, if the neurons are not damaged, the axons have the ability to regenerate
and to attempt to reach their original target site. This is the basis, for example, of the eventual return of sensation
and muscle control in a surgically reattached limb. Neurons in the CNS also have the ability to regenerate interrupted
axons; however, they have a much more difficult task in reaching their original targets due to both the presence of
scar tissue formed by proliferating glia and to the increased complexity of the connectivity in the CNS.

This chapter outlines and discusses current methods for detecting neurotoxicity in humans. In contrast to studies
of neurotoxicity in animals where functional changes readily can be correlated with neuroanatomic and neurochemical
alterations, there are ethical and technical barriers to the direct observation of neuronal damage in humans. Neurotoxicity
in humans is most commonly measured by relatively noninvasive neurophysiologic and neurobehavioral methods that
assess cognitive, affective, sensory, and motor function. The evaluation of human neurotoxicity and the relevance
to risk assessment will be discussed within the context of clinical evaluation, epidemiologic/worksite studies,
and human laboratory exposure studies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurobehavioral assessment methods are used extensively in clinical neurology and neuropsychology to evaluate
patients suspected of having neurologic disease. An extensive array of examiner-administered and paper and pencil
tasks are used to assess sensory, motor, cognitive, and affective functions and personality states/traits. Neurobehavioral
data are synthesized with information from neurophysiologic studies, imaging techniques, medical history, etc.,
to derive a working diagnosis. Clinical diagnostic approaches have provided a rich conceptual framework for understanding
the functions (and malfunctions) of the central and peripheral nervous systems and have formed the basis for the development
of methods for measuring the behavioral expression of nervous system disorders. Human neurobehavioral toxicology
has borrowed heavily from neurology and neuropsychology for concepts of nervous system impairment and functional
assessment methods. Neurobehavioral toxicology has adopted the neurologic/neuropsychologic model, using adverse
changes in behavioral function to assist in identifying chemically or drug-induced changes in nervous system processes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assessment of neurobehavioral function by the clinical examination of a patient has long been used as a primary tool
in neurologic diagnosis. The domains of cognitive function, motor function, sensation, reflexes, and cranial nerve
function are a standard part of the clinical neurologic exam. Movement and gait, speech fluency and content, verbal
memory, deep tendon reflexes, muscle strength, symmetry of movement and strength, ocular movements, sensory function
(pressure, vibration, visual, auditory), motor coordination, and logical reasoning are only a few of the functions
assessed by neurologists (Denny-Brown et al., 1982). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trained and experienced clinicians gather these data by observation, verbal exchange, and direct examination.
Neurologic exams are sensitive indicators of neurologic disease; the data have predictive value for the diagnosis
of underlying nervous system disease, and the methods have been extensively validated against other diagnostic
procedures (e.g., imaging, neurophysiologic testing), the course of the illness, and autopsy findings. Examination
of the patient in a semistructured procedure can yield a wealth of information and insights about functional impairment
and the underlying neuropathology.

3.2.2. Neuropsychological Testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neuropsychologists have developed quantitative methods to supplement clinical neurologic exam and laboratory
data for the diagnosis of neurologic disease. Currently, two assessment batteries, the Luria-Nebraska and the Halstead-Reitan,
and shorter versions are used in clinical practice. The batteries consist of subtests that quantify a wide spectrum
of cognitive, motor, sensory, intellectual, affective, and personality functions. The pattern of relative performance
on the subtests can be interpreted along with historical and medical data to suggest the presence or absence of neurologic
disease and the possible anatomic location of any focal lesions or degeneration. Clinical interpretation of the
data is enhanced by data on age-related population norms for many subtests and by the systematic observation of the
patient during testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several neurotoxicity assessment batteries use components of neuropsychological tests and have adapted and shortened
analogs of some subtests. Tests derived from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale_Revised (WAIS&hyph;R) have
been used frequently to assess neurobehavioral impairment from chemical agents, and other abbreviated variations
of neuropsychological battery subtests have been incorporated into neurobehavioral toxicity batteries and used
in field and laboratory studies.

3.2.3. Applicability of Clinical Methods to Neurotoxicology Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurologic and neuropsychologic methods have long been employed to identify the adverse health effects of environmental
workplace exposures. Peripheral neuropathies (with sensory and motor disturbances), encephalopathies, organic
brain syndromes, extrapyramidal syndromes, demyelination, autonomic changes, and dementia are well-characterized
consequences of acute and chronic exposure to chemical agents. The range of exposure conditions that produce clinical
signs of neurotoxicity also has been defined by using these clinical methods. It is very important to make external/internal
dose measurements in humans in order to determine the actual dose(s) which can cause unwanted effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aspects of the clinical neurologic examination approach limit its usefulness for neurotoxicologic risk assessment.
Information obtained from the neurologic exam is mostly qualitative and descriptive rather than quantitative.
Estimates of the severity of functional impairment can be reliably placed into only three or four categories (for
example, mild, moderate, severe). Much of the assessment depends on the subjective judgment of the examiner; the
magnitude and symmetry of muscle strength are often judged by having the patient push against the resistance of the
examiner's hands. The datum is therefore the absolute and relative amount of muscle load sensed by the examiner in
his or her arms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compared with other methods, the clinical neurologic exam may be less sensitive in detecting early neurotoxicity
in peripheral sensory and motor nerves. While clinicians' judgments are equal in sensitivity to quantitative methods
in assessing the amplitude of tremor, tremor frequency is poorly quantified by clinicians. Thus, important aspects
of the clinical neurologic exam may be insufficiently quantified and lack sufficient sensitivity for detecting
early neurobehavioral toxicity produced by environmental or workplace exposure conditions. However, a neurologic
evaluation of persons with documented neurobehavioral impairment would be helpful for identifying nonchemical
causes, such as diabetes and cardiovascular insufficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration of a neuropsychological battery also requires a trained technician, and interpretation requires
a trained and experienced neuropsychologist. Depending on the capabilities of the patient, 2 to 4 hours may be needed
to administer a full battery; 1 hour may be needed for the shorter screening versions. These practical considerations
may limit the usefulness of neuropsychological assessment in large field studies of suspected neurotoxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to logistical problems in administration and interpretation, neuropsychological batteries and neurologic
exams share two disadvantages with respect to neurotoxicity risk assessment. First, neurologic exams and neuropsychological
test batteries are designed to confirm and classify functional problems in individuals selected on the basis of signs
and symptoms identified by the patient, family, or other health professionals. Their usefulness in detecting low-base
rate impairment in workers or the general population maybe generally thought to be limited, decreasing the usefulness
of clinical assessment approaches for epidemiologic risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, neurologic exams and neuropsychologic test batteries were largely developed to assess the functional correlates
of the most common forms of nervous system dysfunction: brain trauma, focal lesions, and degenerative conditions.
The clinical tests were primarily validated against these neurologic disease states. There has been insufficient
research to demonstrate which tests designed to assess functional expression of neurologic disease are most useful
in characterizing the modes of CNS impairment produced by chemical agents and drugs. More research is needed to validate
the usefulness of neuropsychologic test methods in neurotoxicology.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chemical agents directly or indirectly affect a wide range of nervous system activities. Many of these chemical actions
are expressed as alterations of behavior; Anger (1990a) lists 35 neurobehavioral effects of chemical exposure that
illustrate alterations in sensory, motor, cognitive, affective, and personality function. Professional judgment
is important in the interpretation of data from studies using neurobehavioral methods since some endpoints can be
subjective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dozens of tests of neurobehavioral function have been proposed or used in field or laboratory studies to assess the
neurotoxicity of chemical agents. Table 3&hyph;1 lists some frequently used tests of motor, sensory, cognitive,
and affective neurobehavioral function.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In contrast to the individual focus in clinical evaluation, neurobehavioral tests primarily have been used to evaluate
differences between groups, comparing unexposed groups with persons environmentally or occupationally exposed
to a suspected neurotoxic agent. An ideal evaluation of groups for quantitative evidence of chemically induced neurobehavioral
impairment would involve the assessment of a wide variety of functions, but testing all possible neurobehavioral
functions that might be affected in a group of exposed workers, for example, would be impossible. Therefore, a testing
strategy has been to use limited number tests that sample representative neurobehavioral functional domains such
as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dexterity, visual memory, and reaction time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many field and laboratory studies have selected neurobehavioral methods according to available information about
the spectrum of effects of the suspected neurotoxic agent(s). This focused strategy is useful for answering specific
questions about known neurotoxins. To identify unspecified neurotoxic effects in groups of workers or to characterize
the effects of less well-studied chemicals or mixtures of chemicals, several tests that sample a representative
range of functional domains have been grouped into test batteries. The advantage of a standardized battery is that
data from different study populations and chemical classes can be compared, and similarities in effects observed
(Johnson, 1987). Standardized batteries can be categorized into investigator-administered and computer-administered
types.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The WHO-recommended Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery (NCTB) (Johnson, 1987), the Finnish Institute of Occupational
Health (FIOH) (Hanninen, 1990), and the Pittsburgh Occupational Exposures Test Battery (POET) (Ryan et al., 1987)
are three commonly used batteries. The NCTB is frequently used in field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies worldwide and can be fit inside a medium-sized suitcase for transport. The NCTB consists of the following
tests: simple reaction time task, digit-symbol coding task, timed motor coordination test (Santa Ana pegboard),
digit span memory test, Benton Visual Retention test, pursuit aiming test, and the Profile of Mood States (POMS).
Based on factor-analytic studies (Hooisma et al., 1990), these tests are believed to measure the functional domains
of immediate memory, attention, dexterity/hand-eye coordination, reaction time, and mood. Long-term memory,
verbal and language functions, auditory sensation, judgment, and so forth are not assessed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Computerized tests and batteries have been developed for field and laboratory use. The Neurobehavioral Evaluation
System (NES) (Baker et al., 1985), MicroTox (Eckerman et al., 1985), the SPES (Iregren et al., 1985), and the NCTR Operant
Battery (Paule et al., 1990) are computerized systems developed for neurotoxicity assessment. Current versions
of the NES, for example, consist of about 15 different neurobehavioral tests, and the battery has been used in epidemiologic
studies of groups exposed to solvent, pesticide, and mercury, and in laboratory studies of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although many computerized tests appear to tap similar neurobehavioral domains as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncomputerized batteries, the visual mode of presentation, the manual mode of response, and the emphasis on speed
of responding are believed to have led to significant differences in results obtained from computerized versus noncomputerized
forms of similar tests. Attempts to clarify the differences between computerized and noncomputerized test batteries
have met with difficulty. Although some tests are similar in each type of battery, size and duration of stimuli, presentation
and response modality, number of trials, and scoring vary arbitrarily, preventing direct comparison. An example
is the digit-symbol test on the NCTB and the symbol-digit test on the NES. Although almost identical in task requirements,
procedural and scoring differences prevent direct comparison of the results from these two tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postural stability is an aspect of integrated sensory and motor function that increasingly is being evaluated in
clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory investigations of effects of pesticides and solvents, and would be useful
for assessing therapeutic drug-induced movement disorders such as neuroleptics. Measurement of postural stability
requires a computer, special software, monitor, and a force transduction platform on which the subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must stand (Dick et al., 1990). Mechanical and capacitive field methods for assessing the amplitude and frequency
of tremor also are seeing more frequent use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An advantage of computerized testing is the standardization of test presentation, but a disadvantage is the need
for delicate, expensive computers and measurement devices that require transport for field studies. Noncomputerized
test batteries may be less costly to purchase and easier to transport, enhancing their desirability in field studies,
but test administrators require training and small differences in test administration may affect the data.

3.3.2. Neurophysiologic Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With improvements in the capabilities and size of equipment, quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiologic measurement of sensory and motor function will be increasingly useful in human neurotoxicity
evaluations. A major advantage of these methods for risk assessment is that they can be assessed in both human and animal
subjects and the data can be interpreted in an homologous manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electromyographic responses (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) have been used in the assessment of peripheral
nerve neurotoxicity. Some techniques require that needle electrodes be placed beneath the skin for stimulation
and recording and are therefore somewhat uncomfortable for the subject. However, the methods are quantitative,
provide multiple endpoints of PNS function, and have clinical relevance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adverse effects of solvents, pesticides, and metals have been identified with EMG/NCV neurophysiologic measures.
Although not reduced as a function of duration of employment, maximum nerve conduction velocity (MCV) has been reported
to vary systematically with cumulative exposure to carbon disulfide (Johnson et al., 1983), suggesting that this
measure may be particularly valuable for quantitative risk assessment of some types of peripheral motor nerve toxicity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noninvasive neurophysiologic test methods used in neurotoxicity evaluations include the electroencephalogram
(EEG), visually evoked response (VER), somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), and the brainstem auditory evoked
response (BAER). The EEG is the summed electrical activity of neurons measured with scalp electrodes; voltage and
frequency are primary measures. Evoked methods employ specific eliciting stimuli applied to the sense organs to
measure nervous system electrical response. Visual patterns, sounds, and cutaneous stimuli are presented to the
subject, and ``evoked'' voltage changes in the nervous system are measured with skin electrodes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While EEGs were developed as a tool in the neurologic diagnosis of seizure disorders and other brain diseases, dose-related
EEG changes in chemically exposed (especially solvents and styrene) individuals have been noted (Seppalainen and
Harkonen, 1976). EEG measurement requires large recording devices that can be used in the laboratory or clinic, but
are difficult to use in field studies. However, compact computerized recording equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been developed, and automated spectral analyses of EEGs have recently been applied to neurotoxicity evaluation
(Piikivi and Tolonen, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to EEGs, evoked response technology is improving, and equipment, while expensive, is becoming more portable.
VERs have been used to detect the sensory toxicity of solvents and carbon monoxide in human subjects, and a relationship
has been suggested between BAER and blood lead levels in children exposed to lead-containing dust in the environment
(Otto and Hudnell, 1990). Evoked potentials also may be conditioned, allowing the use of sensory methods to investigate
associative processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-response functions have been found with evoked methods. A curvilinear relationship was found between BAER
and blood lead concentrations in children (Otto and Hudnell, 1990), and a biphasic function described visual evoked
potential (VEP) latency and visual contrast sensitivity and perchloroethylene exposure concentration in a laboratory
study (Altmann et al., 1991). In the latter study, the direction of the response was jointly dependent on dose and stimulus
parameters. In addition, changes over time in the effect of the solvent on VEP were dose and stimulus parameter dependent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two important methodologic considerations are illustrated by BAER and VEP data. One is that low concentrations of
some chemical agents may produce effects (shorter latencies in these examples) that could be inaccurately interpreted
as facilitation rather than impairment. Changes in neuronal latencies in either direction could be a result of a neurotoxic
process. The second is that the detection of neurotoxic effects is dependent on dose-time-testing parameter interactions.
A thorough understanding of the effects of testing parameters on the dose-response relationship and the time course
of chemical effect will be necessary for interpreting neurotoxicity studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of neurophysiologic methods, such as evoked and conditioned potentials, for neurotoxicity risk
assessment should be encouraged. These methods provide relatively unambiguous quantitative data on sensory function
that may have clear implications for health, are influenced by fewer extraneous variables than are self-report and
neurobehavioral performance tests, and allow relatively direct extrapolation of effects between animals and humans.

3.3.3. Neurochemical Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the major difficulties in risk assessment is estimating exposure parameters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dose or body burden actually absorbed by the individual. In epidemiologic studies, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual absorption and bioavailability of a chemical from an exposure are frequently unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Measurement of chemical concentrations in biologic fluids or tissues is one way to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure more precisely the concentration at the site(s) of toxic effect. In epidemiologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies, this has been possible only for chronic exposure and for acute exposure to chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with long biologic half-lives in the body, such as lead, other metals, and bromides. Blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead levels show correlations with neurobehavioral impairment, but blood lead levels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative correlates of toxicity only for relatively acute doses. In children, for example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the majority of lead-related impairment is the result of chronic, rather than acute, absorption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cumulative amount of lead sequestered in tissues (such as deciduous teeth) may be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more representative indicator of the area under the time-concentration curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For chemicals with half-lives in the body too short for estimating absorbed dose, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biochemical products from the chemical or from the physiologic effects of the chemical may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve as an index of exposure. Serum enzyme concentrations (cholinesterase) and esterases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in other tissues (lymphocyte target esterase) have been employed in field studies to detect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pesticide exposure, while vanillylmandelic acid (product of catecholamine neurotransmitter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biotransformation) and erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations have been used with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
varying success in differentiating between lead-exposed and control workers. The addition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar ``exposure biomarker'' measures to laboratory studies may allow the development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative estimates of absorbed dose under various exposure conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The measurement of metabolic products of neurotoxic agents may be extremely useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in risk assessment; an example comes from cancer risk assessment. Human data from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
early 1970s on saturation of microsomal methylene chloride biotransformation to carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monoxide (Stewart et al., 1972), along with subsequent animal carcinogenesis data garnered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the 1980s, provided a quantitative basis for a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of methylene chloride cancer risk assessment (Andersen et al., 1991). The information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human CO pathway kinetics provided the homologous key that allowed extrapolation of risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from animals to humans on a comparative physiologic basis rather than using default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3.3.4. Imaging Techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of recently developed computerized imaging techniques for evaluating brain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity and cerebral/peripheral blood flow have added valuable information to the neurologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diagnostic process. These imaging methods include thermography, positron emission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tomography, passive neuromagnetic imaging (magnetoencephalography), magnetic resonance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, computerized tomography, doppler 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultrasonography, and computerized EEG recording/analysis (brain electrical activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mapping). The research application of these invasive and noninvasive quantitative methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has primarily been in neurology, schizophrenia research, drug abuse, AIDS research and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic encephalopathy (Hagstadius et al., 1989). Although the equipment for brain imaging is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive and not portable, neuroimaging techniques promise to be valuable clinical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory research tools in human neurotoxicology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.3.5. Neuropathologic Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neuropathologic examination of nervous system tissue has been used to confirm data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from clinical testing and to contribute to the understanding of mechanisms of action of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. Peripheral nerve biopsies have confirmed chemically induced peripheral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuropathies and evaluated rates of recovery (Fullerton, 1969). Postmortem examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous tissue also has elucidated the neuropathological effects of carbon disulfide, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clioquinol, and doxorubicin (Spencer and Schaumburg, 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.3.6. Self-Report Assessment Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Self-report measures relevant to neurotoxicity risk assessment consist of histories of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms, events, behaviors, and environmental conditions. Information is obtained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
face-to-face interviews, structured interviews (often conducted for diagnostic purposes), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical histories, questionnaires, and survey instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Self-report instruments are the only means for measuring some symptoms and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interoceptive states, such as pain and nausea. Self-reports also are used to obtain information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on behaviors and events (e.g., exposure conditions) especially when practical, legal, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethical limitations prevent direct observation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subjective symptoms elucidated from self-report instruments are responsive to dose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hanninen et al. (1979) found that subjective symptoms were positively correlated with blood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead levels in exposed workers. Subjective pain estimations are correlated with dose and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of centrally and peripherally acting analgesics, and anxiety scores on a variety of scales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are responsive to the size of the anxiolytic dose.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Symptom checklists are used in epidemiologic research to identify the pattern of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjective complaints, which can be used to guide the selection of objective assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. The distribution of symptoms can be correlated with indices of exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if particular symptoms are more prevalent in exposed persons (Sjogren et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Self-report data are notable for biases that may influence them; these biases are well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known in epidemiology, clinical practice, and social science. Even in the most superficial of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions, respondents may consciously or unknowingly bias the answer to fit what they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe to be the examiner's expectations. Details of objective events or subjective states are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to alteration; recall and reporting of remembered occurrences may be biased to fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretations and expectations. The socioeconomic status, gender, and affiliation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tester also have been identified as biasing variables. Bias occurs when information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested about behaviors, beliefs, or feelings believed by the respondent to be socially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undesirable or when reinforcement contingencies (e.g., litigation) strongly favor selective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biases in self-report data can be reduced by making the questionnaire anonymous or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly confidential; objective data can be used to validate self-reports. Ethnographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations, objective measurement of behavior, biologic samples, and the observations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant others are employed to validate self-report data. Consistent descriptions of events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by several persons lend credence to the reliability of the report. Many clinical interviews 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and self-report assessment instruments include some mechanisms for detecting self-report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bias, either by looking for endorsement of improbable behaviors, or by examining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency of information gathered in several ways or from several sources. Concordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among biologic indices, observations, and physical examinations increases the judged validity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of self-reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3.3.6.1. Mood scales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes in mood and emotionality can be consequences of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. For example, case reports have identified mood changes from exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercury, lead, solvents, and organophosphate insecticides. The Taylor Manifest Anxiety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scale and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) are standardized self-report assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments for which there is some evidence of sensitivity to chemical insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The POMS, a component of the Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery, is a self-report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure that asks respondents to use a 5-point scale to rate the magnitude of 65 subjective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states, such as ``tense,'' ``relaxed,'' ``hopeless,'' ``guilty,'' etc., that they have experienced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the past week. The responses are scored according to six mood factors, and a Total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mood Disturbance Score also may be calculated. Liang et al. (1990) used the POMS to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate lead-exposed workers (mean blood lead concentration of 41 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/dL) from a battery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant and a control group from a fabric-weaving manufacturer. Exposed workers were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly higher on tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion scales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mood scales were developed to aid in assessment of psychological disorders, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depression, and to track treatment response. In addition, mood is modulated by metabolic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and endocrine variables in health and disease and can change rapidly in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpersonal, workplace, and environmental events. The large number of nonchemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables and the lability of mood make inclusion of carefully selected controls essential in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using affect as an endpoint in neurotoxicity research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The validity of mood scales may be limited to the specific populations in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity studies were performed. As characterizations of internal states, the meaning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
descriptors in the POMS established for one culture may not be the same as the meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that concept or term in other cultures or in other language systems. There may be variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interpretation of the terms by respondents across English-speaking subcultures, perhaps as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a function of education or the size of the verbal community. While these differences may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not impede a global clinical interpretation, the reduction in generalizability across study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations may be sufficient to decrease the usefulness of subjective scales in quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity risk assessment.

3.3.6.2. Personality scales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattell 16 PF, and the Eysenck Personality Inventory have occasionally been used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity research. Exposed and nonexposed groups have differed on several scales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from these standardized questionnaires. The diagnostic power of the MMPI, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, is not in the individual scales but in the pattern of scores on the 10 clinical and 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity scales. Because interpretation of the MMPI requires a trained diagnostician with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience in the population of interest, it is less likely to be useful in quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.4.1. Epidemiologic Studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Epidemiology has been defined as ``the study of the distributions and determinants of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease and injuries in human populations'' (Mausner and Kramer, 1985). Knowing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of illness in groups and the factors that influence the distribution is the tool of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiology that allows the evaluation of causal inference with the goal of prevention and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cure of disease. Epidemiologic studies are a means of evaluating the effects of neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances in human populations, but such studies are limited because they must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed shortly after exposure if the effect is acute. Most often these effects are suspected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be a result of occupational exposures due to the increased opportunity for exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial and other chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.4.1.1. Case reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first type of human study undertaken is the case report or case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
series, which can identify cases of a disease and are reported by clinicians or discerned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through active or passive surveillance, usually in the workplace. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological hazards of exposure to Kepone, dimethylaminopropionitrile, and methyl-n-butyl 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ketone were first reported as case studies by physicians who noted an unusual cluster of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases in persons later found to have been exposed to these chemicals (Cone et al., 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, case histories where exposure involved a single neurotoxic agent, though 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informative, are rare in the literature; for example, farmers are exposed to a wide variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially neurotoxic pesticides. Careful case histories assist in identifying common risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors, especially when the association between the exposure and disease is strong, the mode 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of action of the agent is biologically plausible, and clusters occur in a limited period of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case reports are inexpensive compared with other types of epidemiologic studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be obtained more quickly than more complex studies. They provide little information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about disease frequency or population at risk, but their importance has been clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated, particularly in accidental poisoning or acute exposure to high levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicant. They remain an important source of index cases of new diseases and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance in occupational settings. These studies require confirmation by additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiologic research employing other study design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.4.1.2. Cross-sectional studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cross-sectional studies or surveys, both the disease and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected risk factors are ascertained at the same time and the findings are useful in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generating hypotheses. A group of people is interviewed, examined, and tested at a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point in time to ascertain a relationship between a disease and a neurotoxic exposure. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study design does not allow the investigator to determine whether the disease or the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
came first, rendering it less useful in estimating risk. These studies are intermediate in cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and time required to complete compared with case reports and more complex analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.4.1.3. Case-control (retrospective) studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Last (1986) defines a case-control study as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one that ``starts with the identification of persons with the disease (or other outcome variable) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of interest, and a suitable control population (comparison, reference) group of persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the disease.'' He states that the relationship of an ``attribute'' to the disease is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured by comparing the diseased with the nondiseased with regard to how frequently the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attribute is present in each of the groups. The cases are assembled from a population of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons with and without exposure and the comparison group is selected from the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population; the relative distribution of the potential risk factor (exposure) in both groups is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated by computing an odds ratio that serves as an estimate of the strength of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association between the disease and the potential risk factor. The statistical significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ratio is determined by calculating a p-value and is used to approximate relative risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The case-control approach to the study of potential neurotoxins in the environment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided a great deal of information. In his recent text, Valciukas (1991) notes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-control approach is the strategy of choice when no other environmental or biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicator of neurotoxic exposure is available. He further states: ``Considering the fact that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the vast majority of neurotoxic chemical compounds, no objective biological indicators of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure are available (or if they are, their half-life is too short to be of any practical value), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case-control paradigm is a widely accepted strategy for the assessment of toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causation.'' The case-control study design, however, can be very susceptible to bias. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential sources of bias are numerous and can be specific to a particular study, and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed only briefly here. Many of these biases also can be present in cross-sectional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies. For example, recall bias or faulty recall of information by study subjects in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questionnaire-based study can distort the results of the study. Analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case-comparison study design assumes that the selected cases are representative persons with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disease_either all cases with the disease or a representative sample of them have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ascertained. It further assumes that the control or comparison group is representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nondiseased population (or that the prevalence of the characteristic under study is the same in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control group as in general population). Failure to satisfy these assumptions may result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in selection bias, but violation of assumptions does not necessarily invalidate the study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional source of bias in case-control studies is the presence of confounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables, i.e., factors known to be associated with the exposure and causally related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease under study. These must be controlled either in the design of the study by matching 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases to controls on the basis of the confounding factor or in the analysis of the data by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical techniques such as stratification or regression. Matching requires time to identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequate number of potential controls to distinguish those with the proper characteristics, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while statistical control of confounding requires a larger study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of exposure is critical in epidemiologic studies. In occupational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settings, exposure assessment is based on the job assignment of the study subjects, but can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more precise if detailed company records allow the development of exposure profiles.

3.4.1.4. Prospective (cohort, followup) studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a prospective study design, a healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of people is assembled and followed forward in time and observed for the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of disease. Such studies are invaluable for determining the time course for development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease (e.g., followup studies performed in various cities on the effects of lead on child 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development). This approach allows the direct estimate of risks attributed to a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure since disease incidence rates in the cohort are determined and allows the study of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronic effects of exposure. One major strength of the cohort design is that it allows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculation of rates to determine the excess risk associated with an exposure. Also, biases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reduced by obtaining information before the disease develops. This approach, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be very time-consuming and costly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cohort studies information bias can be introduced when individuals provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distorted information about their health because they know their exposure status and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been told of the expected health effects of the exposure under study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A special type of cohort study is the retrospective cohort study in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigator goes back in time to select the study groups and traces them over time, often to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present. The studies usually involve specially exposed groups and have provided much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance in estimating risks due to occupational exposures. Occupational retrospective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort studies rely on company records of past and current employees that include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the dates of employment, age at employment, date of departure, and whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseased (or dead in the case of mortality studies). Workers can then be classified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration and degree of exposure. A retrospective cohort study was performed in which a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cohort of 1,790 bricklayers and 2,601 men exposed to paint solvents was retrospectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and, if a disability pension had been awarded, the subjects were examined for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of presenile dementia. This study found a rate ratio of 3.4 for presenile dementia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among the painters as compared with the bricklayers (Johnson, 1987).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurotoxicity assessment has an advantage not afforded the evaluation of other toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints, such as cancer or reproductive toxicity, in that the effects of some chemicals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short in duration and reversible. Under certain circumstances, it is ethically possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform human laboratory exposure studies and obtain data relevant to the risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. Information from experimental human exposure studies has been used to set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational exposure limits, mostly for organic solvents that can be inhaled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory exposure studies have contributed to risk assessment and the setting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure limits for several solvents and other chemicals with acute reversible effects. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals include methylene chloride, perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and p-xylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Dick and Johnson, 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Human exposure studies offer advantages over epidemiologic field studies. Combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with appropriate biological sampling (breath or blood), it is possible to calculate body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations, to examine toxicokinetics, and identify metabolites. Bioavailability, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elimination, dose-related changes in metabolic pathways, individual variability, time course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of effects, interactions between chemicals, interactions between chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental/biobehavioral factors (stressors, workload/respiratory rate) are some processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be evaluated in laboratory studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other goals of laboratory studies include the indepth characterization of effects, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of new assessment methods, and the examination of the sensitivity, specificity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reliability of neurobehavioral assessment methods across chemical classes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory is the most appropriate setting for the study of environmental and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biobehavioral variables that affect the action of chemical agents. The effects of ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, task difficulty, the rate of ongoing behavior, conditioning variables, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tolerance/sensitization, sleep deprivation, motivation, etc., can be studied.

3.4.2.1. Methodologic aspects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From a methodologic standpoint, human laboratory studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be divided into two categories_between-subjects and within-subjects designs. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
former, the neurobehavioral performance of exposed volunteers is compared with that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonexposed participants. In the latter, preexposure performance is compared with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral function under the influence of the chemical or drug. Within-subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs have the advantage of requiring fewer participants, eliminating individual differences 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a source of variability, and controlling for chronic mediating variables, such as caffeine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use and educational achievement. A disadvantage of the within-subjects design is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral tests must be administered more than once. Practice on many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral tests often leads to improved performance that may confound the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the chemical/drug. It is important to allow a sufficient number of test sessions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preexposure phase of the study to allow performance on all tests to achieve a relatively stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in laboratory exposure studies may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be recruited from populations of persons already exposed to the chemical/drug or from naive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. Although the use of exposed volunteers has ethical advantages, can militate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against novelty effects, and allows evaluation of tolerance/sensitization, finding an accessible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed population in reasonable proximity to the laboratory is difficult. Naive participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are more easily recruited, but may differ significantly in important characteristics from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of exposed persons. Naive volunteers are often younger, healthier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and better educated than the populations exposed environmentally, in the workplace, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacotherapeutically. For example, phase I drug trial data from relatively young and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
healthy volunteers may not adequately predict the incidence of neurotoxic side effects in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
older persons with chronic health problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3.4.2.3. Exposure conditions and chemical classes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compared with workplace and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental exposures, laboratory exposure conditions can be controlled more precisely, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but exposure periods are much shorter. Generally only one or two relatively pure chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are studied for several hours while the population of interest may be exposed to multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals containing impurities for months or years. Laboratory studies are therefore better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at identifying and characterizing effects with acute onset and the selective effects of pure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most laboratory studies of neurobehavioral function have employed individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents, combinations of two solvents, or very low concentrations of chemicals released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from household and office materials (volatile organic compounds). This selection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily because solvent effects are reversible, because there are wide margins of safety for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acute effects of solvents, because solvents can be administered via inhalation methods that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow calculation of body concentrations by breath sampling methods that do not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needle sticks, because over 1 million workers may have occupational solvent exposure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the extensive use of solvents in household products. Chemicals studied in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory over the past 40 years have included ozone, NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, CO, styrene, lead, anesthetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases, pesticides, irritants, chlorofluorocarbon compounds, and propylene glycol dinitrite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Caffeine, diazepam, and ethanol have been used in laboratory studies as positive control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Neurobehavioral test methods may be selected according to several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategies. A test battery that examines multiple neurobehavioral functions may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful for screening and the initial characterization of acute effects. Selected neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests that measure a more limited number of functions in multiple ways may be more useful 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for elucidating mechanisms or validating specific effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both chemical and behavioral control procedures are valuable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examining the specificity of the effects. A concordant effect among different measures of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same neurobehavioral function (e.g., reaction time) and a lack of effect on some other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of psychomotor function (e.g., untimed manual dexterity) would increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence in a selective effect on motor speed and not on attention or on nonspecific motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. Likewise, finding concordant effects among similar chemical or drug classes along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with different effects from dissimilar classes would support the specificity of chemical effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, finding that the effects of a solvent were similar to those of ethanol but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caffeine would support the specificity of solvent effects on a given measure of neurotoxicity.

3.4.2.6. Ethical issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most human exposure studies in the laboratory have been justified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of data indicating that the chemical or drug exposure produces only temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reversible functional effects. The use of occupationally, environmentally, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapeutically exposed populations as a source of participants also makes the risks from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research exposure small relative to nonlaboratory sources of risk. Protection of human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjects is also provided by the informed consent process; the health risks (known and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unknown) and benefits of the research are thoroughly explained to each participant, who may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminate participation in the study at any time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite safeguards, several chemicals and drugs thought at the time of the exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study to produce only temporary neurobehavioral effects are now (20 years later) suspected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of being potential human carcinogens on the basis of animal and human data (e.g., methylene 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride, perchloroethylene). Other chemicals, however, are now thought to be less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenic or otherwise less toxic in humans than once believed. Rapid advances in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of toxicology make it difficult to communicate, to potential subjects, reliable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the likelihood of long-term, latent, or delayed adverse effects on health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent to the study. The communication of uncertainty about potential long-term effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to research participants is essential if human exposure studies are to be conducted ethically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are to continue their contributions to neurotoxicology and risk assessment.

3.5.1. Developmental Deficits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While adult neurotoxicology evaluates the effects of chemical exposure on relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable nervous system structure and function, developmental neurotoxicology addresses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special vulnerabilities of the young and the old. Neurobehavioral assessment of chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity is complicated by having to measure functional impairment within a sequential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
progression of emergence, maturation, and gradual decline of nervous system capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods in developmental neurotoxicity assessment must reflect the diversity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral functions, from neonates to the elderly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure of pregnant women to alcohol, drugs of abuse, therapeutic drugs, nicotine, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and environmental chemicals may result in the immediate or delayed appearance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral impairment in children (Kimmel, 1988; Nelson, 1991a). Postnatal exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of children to chemical agents in the environment, such as lead, also may impair IQ and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other indices of neurobehavioral function (Needleman et al., 1979). Neurotoxic effects may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impair speech and language, attention, general intelligence, ``state'' regulation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsiveness to external stimulation, learning and memory, sensory and motor skills, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visuospatial processing, affect and temperament, and responsiveness to nonverbal social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimuli. Chemical neurotoxicity may be manifested as decreases in functional capabilities or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delays in normative developmental progression. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxic effects are not limited to direct exposure of the fetus or child to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical. Animal studies suggest that altered neurobehavioral development in offspring may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result from exposure of males (Joffe and Soyka, 1981) and females to chemical substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to conception. In this case, altered postnatal development may reflect chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influences on mechanisms of inheritance, copulatory behavior, nutritional status, hormonal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status, or the uterine environment. In animals and humans, chemical exposure of parents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may indirectly impair postnatal development through changes in milk composition, parenting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behaviors, and other aspects of the environment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In older adults the normal aging process alters the response to neurotoxicants. Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic changes may underlie altered sensitivities to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic effects of drugs and chemicals. An example well known in geriatric medicine is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the apparent increase in sensitivity of the elderly to the toxic effects of anxiolytics (Salzman, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1981). Decreases in biotransformation rate and renal elimination of parent drug and active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolites, not related to disease processes, may partially account for the increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerability (Friedel, 1978). Chronic disease states in older persons may result in decreased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional capabilities and increased vulnerability to neurotoxic effects. Chronic diseases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also may prompt pharmacotherapy that may impair neurobehavioral function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cardiovascular, psychopharmacologic, and antineoplastic medications may result in patterns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of neurobehavioral impairment not typically seen in younger individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3.5.2. Methodologic Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standardized methods are being developed for pediatric neurotoxicity assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurobehavioral functions emerge during developmental phases from neonatal stage through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
secondary school, and nervous system insult may be reflected not only in impairment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergent functions, but also as delays in the appearance of new functions. Both the severity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and type of deficit are affected by the dose and duration of exposure (Nelson, 1991b), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different sensitivities to chemical effects may be exhibited at different stages of nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system development. Early episodes of exposure may produce structural damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system that may not be developmentally expressed in behavior for several months or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selection of appropriate testing methods and conditions is more important when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing children because of shorter attention spans and increased dependence on parental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and environmental supports. In addition, because of the increasing complexity of functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities during early development, only a few tests appropriate for infants can be validly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readministered to older children. Given the complexity of these variables, the task of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devising sensitive, reliable, and valid assessment instruments or batteries for pediatric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations will be challenging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment methods in older adults must be capable of distinguishing chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug effects from the effects of aging processes and chronic disease states (Crook et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983). Assessment methods must be valid and reliable with repeated administration across a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant portion of the lifespan, and take into consideration the time (days, months, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years) that may intervene between exposure/insult and the expression of neurotoxicity as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional impairment. Research on nonexposed populations to develop age-appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normative scores for neurobehavioral functions will be important for the interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment instruments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental exposure to neurotoxic chemicals and drugs is correlated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
socioeconomic and ethnic status. Assessment methods will therefore have to be adapted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse ethnic, cultural, and language groups. While gender differences in early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development have been noted, differential responses of males and females to neurotoxicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been less well explored and should receive attention.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The value of human neurobehavioral test methods for quantitative risk assessment is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the number of the following criteria that can be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Demonstrate sensitivity to the kinds of neurobehavioral impairment produced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals; that is, able to detect a difference between exposed and nonexposed populations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
field studies or between exposure and nonexposure periods in human laboratory research or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within exposed populations over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Show specificity for neurotoxic chemical effects and not be unduly responsive to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
host of other nonchemical factors, and show specificity for the neurobehavioral function 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed to be measured by the test method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Demonstrate adequate reliability (consistency of measurement over time) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validity (concordance with other behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, or anatomic measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of neurotoxicity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Show graded amounts of neurobehavioral change as a function of exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter, absorbed dose, or body burden along some ordinal or continuous metric (dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. For representative classes or subclasses of CNS/PNS-active chemicals, identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single effects or patterns of impairment across several tests or functional domains that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably consistent from study to study (structure-activity). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Be amenable to the development of a procedurally similar counterpart that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to assess homologous behaviors in animals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individual neurobehavioral tests and test batteries have detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences between exposed and nonexposed populations in epidemiologic studies and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory studies. Effects have been detected by neurobehavioral methods at concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thought by other kinds of evaluation not to produce neurotoxicity. Workplace exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits to many chemicals have been set on the basis of neurobehavioral studies. While the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall sensitivity of neurobehavioral methods is sufficient to be useful in neurotoxicology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment, some methods are notably insensitive across several chemical classes while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sensitivity of other neurobehavioral tests varies according to the spectrum of neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of the chemical or drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sensitivity is sometimes negatively correlated with reliability; selecting for tests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
show little change over time may also select for tests that are not sensitive to neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having more control over the testing environment and using a repeated measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design may decrease variability and increase statistical power, but these tactics may introduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other problems. There is some suggestion that experience in highly structured laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments with explicit stimulus conditions may reduce the sensitivity of humans and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals to the effects of drugs and chemicals, and the sensitivity of neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures to impairment by a chemical or drug may depend on neurobehavioral training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
history (Terrace, 1963; Brady and Barrett, 1986). Sensitivity may also be decreased if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline behaviors are stable and well practiced or an escape/avoidance procedure is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The systematic introduction of stimulus or response changes to induce transitional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behaviors, such as in a transitional state or repeated learning paradigms, may be one way to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retain the advantage of a stable baseline, have sufficient sensitivity, and avoid practice effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Anger and Setzer, 1979).

3.6.1.2. Specificity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are two kinds of specificity in neurobehavioral assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical or drug neurotoxicity. Chemical specificity refers to the ability of a test to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical or drug effects and to be relatively resistant to the influence of nonchemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables. The second type of specificity refers to the ability of a test method to measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in a single neurobehavioral function (e.g., dexterity) or a restricted number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions, rather than a broad range of functions (attention, reasoning, dexterity, and vision). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The neurobehavioral expression of neurotoxic chemical or drug effects is a function of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the joint interaction of ongoing nervous system processes with the chemical substance and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with biopsychosocial variables that also influence nervous system activity. In laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure studies numerous environmental, behavioral, and biologic variables can influence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the type or magnitude of neurotoxic effects of chemical agents and drugs (MacPhail, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These variables include ambient temperature, physical workload, task difficulty, the social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and tangible reward characteristics of the laboratory setting, redundancy of stimuli, the rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and form of the behavioral response, conditioning factors, and the interoceptive stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties of the chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laboratory research participant's history and habits outside the laboratory also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may affect chemical-neurobehavioral interactions by influencing the baseline level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance on neurobehavioral tests or directly affecting the response of the CNS to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. Age, gender, educational level, intellectual functioning, economic status, acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and chronic health conditions (including developmental or current neurologic conditions), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol/drug/tobacco effects or withdrawal, emotional status or significant life events, sleep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation, fatigue, and cultural factors are only a few of the variables that may affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance in laboratory studies (Williamson, 1991; Cassitto et al., 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The influence of these selection and biopsychosocial variables on the neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of workplace chemicals is poorly understood, although their effects on drug-behavior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interactions have been more thoroughly explored. Controlling or understanding chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonchemical variables will be important for ensuring adequate specificity for risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes.

3.6.1.3. Reliability and validity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reliability refers to the ability of a given test to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closely similar results when administered more than once over a period of time or in similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. Reliability is meaningful only with respect to the measurement of functions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be expected to change significantly over the time period. Test-retest reliability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coefficients are between 0.6 and 0.9 (Beaumont, 1990) for most of the tests in the NCTB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With notable exceptions, other neurobehavioral tests have similar reliabilities. Reliabilities in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 0.8 to 0.9 range are usually thought acceptable. As reliability decreases, measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error is more likely to mask neurotoxic chemical effects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The validity of a given neurotoxicity test relies on evidence that it adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures the domain of interest and is not highly correlated with tests that are believed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure unrelated functions. These convergent and divergent aspects of validity are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently divided into construct, content, and criterion subcategories. Construct validity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to the ability of a given test to measure the intended function or construct (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention), content to how well the test measures the major aspects of the function, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion to how highly the test correlates with other tests of the same function or predicts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic impairment after similar insult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many neurobehavioral tests purport to measure the same or similar cognitive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensory, or motor functions, but correlations between these tests under chemical exposure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control conditions can be disappointingly low. This is not surprising given the procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences that exist among neurobehavioral tests. Tests intended to measure the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function often have different presentation and response modalities (visual, verbal, manual), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have differing numbers of trials or a different time limit, and have different methods for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scoring the results. Many tests have such large procedural differences that direct comparison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is difficult. Assessment of validity for neurobehavioral tests of specific constructs, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention, is further complicated in that sensory input, other cognitive processes, and motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses are unavoidable contributors to the test result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.6.1.4. Dose response. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dose in this discussion refers to the measurement of chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolite concentrations in the body and to estimations of exposure. Both exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment and biologic concentrations should be measured whenever possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-response relationships have been observed both in field and laboratory studies. Two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent human solvent exposure studies used lower exposure concentration that resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mucosal membrane effects reported by subjects as odors or irritation (Dick et al., 1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hjelm et al., 1990). Neurobehavioral impairment was not detected in these studies. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of over 50 organic solvent human exposure experiments found that neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment generally occurred at mean concentrations higher than those associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irritation, although there was often overlap among the irritant and impairment concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranges (Dick, 1988). Defining neurotoxic dose-response relationships in humans decreases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the uncertainties of extrapolation from animal data and allows a more accurate risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent human solvent exposure studies have employed low concentrations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which neurobehavioral impairment was not observed. Rather, these studies have primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected the effects of solvents on mucosal membranes reported by subjects as odors or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irritation (Dick, unpublished observation). While these data may be relevant to setting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workplace and environmental exposure limits, they can be expected to provide little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about the neurobehavioral impairment that occurs at higher concentrations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between irritant/odor concentration-effect functions and neurobehavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment concentration-effect functions is not known, but it is probably not linear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-dependent mechanisms of toxic effect can be expected to complicate risk extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across the dose-response range in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further complication in dose-response extrapolation is that low concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals may appear to improve performance as measured by neurobehavioral tests, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher doses are more likely to impair performance. Improved performance does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily indicate the absence of neurotoxicity; both increases and decreases in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral performance may result from deleterious chemical interactions with neurons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-response extrapolation is further complicated by the observation that facilitative or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment effects within a given dosage range may occur at some parameters of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimulus or aspects of the response (response rate-dependent) but not at others (Altmann et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
al., 1991). Therefore, dose extrapolations are more difficult when there is uncertainty about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shape of the dose-response function (biphasic, linear, etc.) at the relevant test stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and response parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk assessment process with animal data involves extrapolation from the effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of high doses in animals to predict the effects of chronic low-dose exposure in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With data from laboratory studies of humans in a risk assessment, however, the extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in the other direction, from very low-dose laboratory exposure to predict the effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronic exposure at higher (but still low) concentrations in the environment and workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low- to high-dose extrapolation within the same species may require different assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and risk assessment procedures. Although high-dose human exposures have occurred in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents, those data are primarily descriptive in nature and cannot easily be plugged into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative risk extrapolation process. Low dose laboratory data may be combined with data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from epidemiologic studies of persons exposed to higher concentrations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Structure-activity relationships for well-known chemicals have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largely been established by clinical methods (and animal studies) and verified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral and neurophysiologic testing. Although an area of active research, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral testing of humans has not yet been able to identify reliable patterns of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impairment among chemical classes. This endeavor has been hampered by most laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research having been limited to the evaluation of low concentrations of solvents and a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other reversible toxicants and by the exposure uncertainties, biases, and confounding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables found in cross-sectional or cohort field studies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Uncovering behavioral and neurophysiologic mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of action is a potential contribution of human laboratory exposure studies to neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment. For example, Stewart et al. (1972) demonstrated that methylene chloride 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was metabolized to carbon monoxide in humans, and further studies (Putz et al., 1979) found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that CO production could account for some of the neurobehavioral impairment observed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that chemical. Recent human laboratory studies of solvents employed low concentrations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced mucosal irritation and strong odor, but little neurobehavioral impairment (Dick, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpublished observation). The mechanisms of action that produce mucosal irritation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic mechanisms that are expressed in neurobehavioral impairment may be quite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different. Data on mucosal irritation and odor may therefore provide limited information for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a neurotoxicity risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.6.2.2. Exposure duration 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A criticism of extrapolation from animal studies to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure conditions is that the effects of short-term exposure (months to 1&hyph;2 years) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals may not accurately predict the effects of chronic exposure (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10 years) in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laboratory studies rarely expose human subjects to solvents for more than 4&hyph;6 hours per day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 2&hyph;5 days while environmental and workplace exposures of concern involve 6&hyph;8 hours of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure per day for years. The uncertainties of extrapolating from relatively acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures to predict the risks from chronic exposure will not be eliminated by using human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory exposure data in risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.6.2.3. Time-dependent effects 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acute exposures that are possible in human laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies may provide little information on chronic time-dependent neurobehavioral effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effects of initial exposure may remain the same, decrease (tolerance), or increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sensitization) with continued or repeated exposure to the chemical. All effects will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in unison; tolerance and sensitization may be observed simultaneously on different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures of neurobehavioral function. The multiple toxicodynamic effects of chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (neurobehavioral and other) seem to follow individual time courses suggestive of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple mechanisms of action. In addition, the processes of tolerance and sensitization can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be influenced by testing conditions and the nature of the behavioral task. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One also must be concerned about latent effects that do not appear for some time after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a brief exposure and ``silent'' cumulative neurotoxic effects that are not observable in acute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human studies. Latent and silent effects not only bring up the possibility of unknown risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for human subjects, but also make more difficult the extrapolation of chronic neurotoxic risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the basis of acute exposures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, the acute exposure conditions possible in human laboratory studies may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide us with very limited information about the long-term effects of chronic exposure.

3.6.2.4. Multiple exposures 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the environment and the workplace, persons are seldom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to only a single chemical. Rather, they are most often exposed to complex mixtures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of chemicals, the relative concentrations of which may vary over time. For example, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
farmer had more than 50 different chemical products (pesticides, herbicides, solvents, metals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gases) with nervous system effects that he used, prepared, or stored in his work shed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemicals used in industrial processes may also contain impurities or contaminants that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce neurotoxic effects or alter the neurotoxicity of the more abundant chemical species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical mixtures may have additive or potentiating effects not predictable from studies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single chemicals (Strong and Garruto, 1991). Human laboratory exposure studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditionally have employed one highly purified chemical or combinations of two chemicals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(usually solvents) and thus may produce a spectrum of neurotoxic effects different from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental and occupational exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been used in human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies (Otto and Hudnell, 1991). VOCs consist of multiple volatile compounds administered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at concentrations commonly found in indoor air from emissions by laminates, carpet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plastics, and other building and decorating materials. Although VOCs are thought to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily mucosal irritation and odors, reports of ``sick building syndrome'' and individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitivity to indoor air contaminants suggest that other neurobehavioral mechanisms also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be operating.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.6.2.5. Generalizability and individual differences 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of field studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory exposure studies are most valuable when they can be extrapolated to the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. Studies conducted in male workers or in young, healthy volunteers may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited applicability to women or to people in other age ranges. It therefore is important to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct studies that include males and females of different ages and ethnic heritage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Culture-sensitive neurobehavioral test methods are being developed and validated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States and other countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is important to increase the generalizability of results, it is equally important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to know when results cannot be generalized. Studies should be specifically directed toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying subsets of individuals who are more or less sensitive to neurotoxic insult or differ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in mode of expression. There are many examples of individual differences that alter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to chemicals and drugs: phenylketonurics are more sensitive to dietary tyramine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and persons with variants of plasma pseudocholinesterase are more affected by some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuromuscular blocking agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3.6.2.6. Veracity of neurobehavioral test results 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In most epidemiologic and human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory studies, research volunteers are highly motivated to perform well on tests of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral function. Under voluntary conditions, actual neurobehavioral performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may serve as a reasonable index of nervous system capabilities. Some studies, however, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted in response to complaints of symptoms thought to be related to workplace, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, or therapeutic exposure to chemicals and drugs. The performance of research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participants with symptoms and complaints may be significantly affected (consciously or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unconsciously) by monetary rewards, emotional relief, or social gains from the validation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their complaints. Under these conditions, performance may or may not accurately reflect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capabilities of the nervous system and may lead to inaccurate conclusions about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude of nervous system dysfunction or about putative chemical or drug etiologies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to suboptimal performance engendered by potential reinforcers or rewards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research participants involved in disputes over suspected neurotoxic exposures or in litigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for monetary damages are likely to be experiencing significant emotional and behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactions from situational sources that can alter the outcome of neurobehavioral assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, fatigue, worry, obsessive thoughts, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distractibility may contribute to less than optimal performance on motor and cognitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral tasks, especially where speed and sustained concentration are important. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under stressful conditions, it may be extremely difficult to differentiate between neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and situational sources of observed functional impairment. Functional neurobehavioral tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not well equipped to distinguish between impairment from neurotoxicity and from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonchemical variables. The use of functional tests in symptomatic populations requires great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care in interpretation. The development of validity scales and other control procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessing nonchemical influences on performance is greatly needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3.6.3. Cross-Species Extrapolation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many neurobehavioral tests were developed according to constructs of human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cognitive processes. The diverse measures of cognitive, sensory, and motor performance in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans are therefore not easily compared with neurobehavioral function in animals. While it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be possible to conceptually relate some animal and human neurobehavioral tests (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grip strength or signal detection), many procedural differences prevent direct comparison 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more direct extrapolation from animals to man might be possible if the tests were

chosen on the basis of procedural similarity rather than on a conceptual basis (Anger, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stebbins and colleagues (1975) were successful in developing homologous procedures in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonhuman primates for the psychophysical evaluation of antibiotic ototoxicity. Efforts to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop comparable tests of memory and other neurobehavioral functions in animals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans are under way (Stanton and Spear, 1990, Paule et al., 1990), and such efforts may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aid in cross-species extrapolation. Other procedurally defined methods, such as Pavlovian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioning (Solomon and Pendlebury, 1988), operant conditioning (Cory-Slechta, 1990), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signal detection, and psychophysical scaling techniques (Stebbins and Coombs, 1975), could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be used to facilitate interspecies risk extrapolation. Deriving comparable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral assessment methods in animals and humans that will allow a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straightforward extrapolation across species is of paramount importance for neurotoxicity risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Determining the risk posed to human health from chemicals requires information about the potential toxicological
hazards and the expected levels of exposure. Some toxicological data can be derived directly from humans. Sources
of such information include accidental exposures to industrial chemicals, cases of food-related poisoning, epidemiological
studies, as well as clinical investigations. While human data are available from clinical trials for therapeutics
and they provide the most direct means of determining effects of potentially toxic substances, for other categories
of substances, it is generally difficult, expensive, and, in some cases, unethical to develop this type of information.
Quite often, the nature and extent of available human toxicological data are too incomplete to serve as the basis for
an adequate assessment of potential health hazards. Furthermore, for a majority of chemical substances human toxicological
data are simply not available. Consequently, for most toxicological assessments it is necessary to rely on information
derived from animal models, usually rats or mice. One of the primary functions of animal studies is to predict human
toxicity prior to human exposure. In some cases, species phylogenetically more similar to human, such as monkeys
or baboons, are used in neurotoxicological studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, animals resemble humans in many ways and can serve as adequate models for toxicity studies (Russell,
1991). This is particularly true with regard to the assessment of adverse effects to the nervous system, whereby animal
models provide a variety of useful information that helps minimize exposure of humans to the risk of neurotoxicity.
There are many approaches to testing for neurotoxicity, including whole animal (in vivo) testing and tissue/cell
culture (in vitro) testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At present, in vivo animal studies currently serve as the principal approach to detect and characterize neurotoxic
hazard and to help identify factors affecting susceptibility to neurotoxicity. Data from animal studies are used
to supplement or clarify limited information obtained from clinical or epidemiological studies in humans, as well
as provide specific types of information not readily obtainable from humans due to ethical considerations. Frequently,
results from animal studies are used to guide the design of toxicological studies in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In vitro tests have been proposed as a means of complementing whole animal tests, which could ultimately reduce the
number of animals used in routine toxicity testing. It also has been proposed that in vitro testing, when properly
developed, may be less time-consuming and more cost-effective than in vivo assessments (Goldberg and Frazier, 1989;
Atterwill and Walum, 1989). By understanding the biological structures or functions affected by toxic substances
in vitro, it also may be possible to predict neurotoxicological effects in the whole animal. An added advantage of
in vitro testing is the growing availability of human cell lines that could be used for directly assessing potential
neurotoxic effects on human tissue. The currently available strategies for in vitro testing have certain limitations,
including the inability to model neurobehavioral effects such as loss of memory or sensory dysfunction or to evaluate
effectively the influence of organ system interactions (e.g., neuronal, endocrinological, and immunological)
on the development and expression of neurotoxicity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In using animal models to predict neurotoxic risk in humans, it is important to understand that the biochemical and
physiological mechanisms that underlie human biological processes, particularly those involving neurological
and psychological functions, are very complex and are sometimes difficult, if not impossible, to model exactly in
a lower species. While this caveat does not preclude extrapolating the results of animal studies to humans, it does
highlight the importance of using valid animal models in well-designed experimental studies.

4.1.2. Validity of Animal Models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whether animal tests or methods actually measure what they are intended to measure, whether the data from such tests
can be obtained reliably, and whether such data can be logically extrapolated to humans are problems for most disciplines
in toxicology. Various proposals have been made for the standardization and validation of methods used in neurotoxicological
research. It is generally agreed that validation is an ongoing process that establishes the credibility of a test,
building an increasing level of confidence in the effective utility of any model of evaluation. The credibility of
a method, as it applies to testing, is usually discussed within several different contexts, including construct
validity, criterion validity, predictive validity, and detection accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construct validity concerns the ability of a method to measure selectively a particular biological function and
not other dimensions. Construct validity is frequently established empirically. For example, sensory dysfunction
such as hearing loss is reported by humans exposed to some chemicals, and tests are designed to detect and quantify
those changes. Such tests are designed to measure changes in auditory function, while other sensations are unaffected
(Tilson, 1987; Moser, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion validity refers to the ability of a method to measure a characteristic relative to some standard. For example,
Horvath and Frantik (1973) noted that the significance of a test measurement as an index of an actual treatment effect
should be validated relative to the effects of a defined reference substance or positive control. Furthermore, each
specific test or type of effect may require an appropriate reference substance for which the given type of effect is
a determining factor of the toxicity. Use of reference agents has obvious advantages in the assessment of unknown
chemicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Predictive validity refers to the ability of a method to predict effects from an incomplete or partial data set. An
animal model of neurotoxicity with good predictive validity would reliably predict neurotoxicity in humans, i.e.,
the animal to human extrapolation would be good. There are several examples in neurotoxicology where animal models
have been developed based on neurotoxicological reports from humans. Presumably, the predictive validity of such
models would enable detecting similar kinds of effects produced by uncharacterized chemicals having a similar mechanism
of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been proposed (Tilson and Cabe, 1978) that the most logical approach to validate animal methods in neurotoxicology
is to evaluate chemicals with and without known neurotoxicity in humans in tests designed for animals (predictive
validity). By using such an approach, it is possible to generate a profile of effects characteristic of each type of
neurotoxicant (criterion validity). This profile could then be used to assess the construct validity of various
tests. That is, procedures assumed to measure the same neurobiological dimension should show similar effects; measures
designed to detect changes in other functions should not be affected. This approach to test validation has been described
as the multitrait-multimethod process of validation (Campbell and Fiske, 1959). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of particular importance in establishing the credibility of a method is the accuracy of detecting a treatment-related
effect (Gad, 1989). Accuracy is a function of two interacting elements, specificity and sensitivity. Specificity
is the ability of a test to respond positively only when the toxic endpoint of interest is present. Sensitivity is the
ability to detect a change when present. This aspect depends on the inherent design of the procedure and experiment.
Increasing the specificity of a test may reduce the possibility of classifying a chemical as neurotoxic when, in fact,
it is not (false positive), but it may increase the probability of missing a true neurotoxicant (false negative).
Increasing sensitivity of a test may reduce the possibility of false negatives, but may increase the probability
of false positives.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like most other measures of toxicological effect, neurotoxic endpoints are subject to a number of experimental variables
that may affect susceptibility to the biological effects of toxicants. In this regard, genetic variation (Festing,
1991) is a particularly important issue in neurotoxicology. For example, most neurotoxicological assessments
are carried out with only one or two species. This may pose problems, however, since species may differ in sensitivity
to neurotoxicants. For example, nonhuman primates are more sensitive than rats (Boyce et al., 1984) or mice (Heikkila
et al., 1984) to the neurodegenerative effects of MPTP, a byproduct in the illicit synthesis of a meperidine analog
(Langston et al., 1983). In the assessment of delayed neuropathology produced by some cholinesterase inhibitors,
it is well known that hens are much more sensitive than rodents (Cavanagh, 1954; Abou-Donia, 1981, 1983). In addition,
rat strains also may be differentially sensitive to some neurotoxicants (Moser et al., 1991). Although it is preferred
that more than one species be tested, the cost required for routine multispecies testing must be considered. Whenever
possible, the choice of animal models should take into account differences in species with regard to pharmacodynamic,
genetic composition and sensitivity to neurotoxic agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to species, other factors such as gender of the test animal must be taken into consideration. Some toxic
substances may have a greater neurotoxicological effect in one gender (Squibb et al., 1981; Matthews et al., 1990).
Thus, screening evaluations frequently require both male and female animals. Another important variable is the
age of the animal (Veronesi et al., 1990). Whether a chemical produces neurotoxicity may depend on the maturational
stage of the organism (Rodier, 1986). Most preliminary assessments are designed to provide information on adults,
which have the greatest probability of being exposed. However, populations undergoing rapid maturation or aged
individuals may be especially vulnerable to neurotoxic agents. Longitudinal studies that assess both genders at
any stage of development address many of the problems associated with differentially sensitive populations.

4.1.3.2. Dosing scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dosing strategy used in experimental studies is an important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variable in the development and expression of neurotoxicity (WHO, 1986). Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicants can produce neurotoxicity following a single exposure, while others require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repeated dosing. Repeated dosing represents the typical pattern of human exposure to many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical substances. Significant differences in response may occur when an acutely toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of material is administered over different exposure periods. For some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicants the onset of neurotoxicity can occur immediately after dosing, while others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may require time after exposure for the toxicity to develop. Effects of repeated exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may result in a progressive alteration in nervous system function or structure, while latent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual effects may be discovered only in association with age-related changes or after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable environmental or pharmacological challenge (Zenick, 1983; MacPhail et al., 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure adequate assessment of neurotoxicity, study designs should include multiple dosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regimens, e.g., repeated exposure, with appropriate dose-to-response intervals of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conduct of neurotoxicological evaluations in studies utilizing excessively toxic doses should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be avoided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4.1.3.3. Other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are a number of other factors that should be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design and interpretation of studies using animal models (WHO, 1986). Design factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include such issues as using properly trained personnel to conduct the studies, the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate numbers of animals per group to achieve reliable statistical significance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling the time-of-day variability. Time of testing relative to exposure is also important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for assessing neurotoxic endpoints such as behavior, and experiments should be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generate a time course of effects, including recovery of function, if any. Housing is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important environmental design factor, because animals housed individually and animals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housed in groups can respond differently to toxic agents. Temperature, as an experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variable, may also affect the outcome of neurotoxicological studies. The responsiveness to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some chemicals (e.g., triethyltin, methamphetamine) varies with ambient temperature (Dyer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Howell, 1982; Bowyer et al., 1992). Some neurobiological endpoints, such as sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evoked potentials, can be influenced by the endogenous temperature of the animal (Dyer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1987). Therefore, changes in body temperature, whether due to fluctuations in ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature or to some chemically induced effect such as inhibition of sweating, can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confound the interpretation of measures such as evoked responses unless proper controls are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the experimental design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because a variety of other physiological changes can influence neuronal functions, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is important to recognize that chemical-related neurotoxicity could result from treatment-induced physiological
changes, such as altered nutritional state (WHO, 1986). As part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicological profile, correlative measures, such as relative and absolute organ weights, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food and water consumption, and body weight and weight gain, may be signs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physiological change associated with systemic toxicity and may be useful in determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative contribution of general toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4.1.3.4. Statistical considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Experimental designs for neurotoxicological studies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently complex, with two or more major variables (e.g., gender, time of testing) varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any single experiment. In addition, such studies typically generate varying types of data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including continuous, dichotomous, and rank-order data. Knowledge and experience in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental design and statistical analyses are important. There are several key statistical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concepts that should be understood in neurotoxicological studies (WHO, 1986; Gad, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The power, or probability, of a study to detect a true effect is dependent on the size of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study group, the frequency of the outcome variable in the general population, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude of effect to be identified. Statistical evaluation of a treatment-related effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves the consideration of two factors or types of errors to be avoided. A Type I error 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to the attribution of an exposure-related neurotoxicological effect when none has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred (false positive), while a Type II error refers to the failure to attribute an effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when an exposure-related effect has actually occurred (false negative). In general, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of a Type I error should not exceed 5 percent and the probability of a Type II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
error should not exceed 20 percent. Power is defined as one minus the probability of a Type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Determination of power also requires knowledge of the difference in magnitude of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome measures observed between exposed and control groups and the variability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome measure among subjects. The sample size required to achieve a given level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistical power increases as variability increases or the difference between groups decreases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous data (i.e., magnitude, rate, amplitude), if found to be normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed, can be analyzed with a general linear model using a grouping factor of dose and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if necessary, repeated measures across time. Post hoc comparisons between control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other treatment groups can be made following tests for overall significance. In the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple endpoints within a series of evaluations, correction for multiple observations (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bonferroni's) might be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Descriptive data (categorical) and rank data can be analyzed using standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonparametric techniques. In some cases, if it is believed that the data fit the linear model, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the categorical data modeling procedure can be used for weighted least-squares estimation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for a wide range of general linear models, including repeated measures analyses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The weighted least-squares approach to categorical and rank data allows computation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistics for testing the significance of sources of variation as reflected by the model.

4.2. Tiered Testing in Neurotoxicology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The utility of tiered testing as an efficient and cost-effective approach to evaluate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical toxicity, including neurotoxicity, has been recognized (NRC, 1975). Briefly, first-tier tests are designed
to determine the presence or absence of neurotoxicity, while second- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tier tests characterize the neurotoxic effect (NRC, 1992). There are at least two aspects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tiered testing, one involving the type of test used (Tilson, 1990a) and the other involving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosing regimen (Goldberg and Frazier, 1989).

4.2.1. Type of Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tests designed to measure the presence or absence of an effect are usually different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from those used to assess the degree of toxicity or the lowest exposure level required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce an effect (Tilson, 1990a). Screening procedures are first-tier tests that typically permit the testing
of many groups of animals. Such procedures may not require extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources and are usually simple to perform. However, these techniques may be labor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intensive, provide subjective measures, yield semiquantitative data, and may not be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive to subtle effects as those designed to characterize neurotoxic effects or second-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. Specialized tests are usually more sensitive and employed in studies concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms of action or the estimation of the lowest effective dose. Such testing procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are usually referred to as secondary tests and may require special equipment and more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive resources. Secondary tests are usually quantitative and yield graded or continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data amenable to routine parametric statistical analyses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing at the first tier is used to determine if a chemical might produce neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following exposure, i.e., hazard detection. In this case, there may be little existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information concerning the neurotoxic potential of an agent. Examples of first-tier tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include functional observational batteries (FOB), including an evaluation of motor activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and routine neurohistopathology. For some chemicals or types of chemicals, there may be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific interest in screening for a particular presumed mechanism of toxicity (e.g., inhibition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cholinesterase or neurotoxic esterase) or neurobiological response (e.g., a site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuronal degeneration). In these cases, specific neurochemical or neuropathological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints can be used in conjunction with first-tier tests. It is desirable that tests selected for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in hazard detection provide a suitable level of sensitivity using the smallest number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A decision to test at the next tier is based on data suggesting that an agent produces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. The information used to make a decision to test a chemical at the secondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level can come from a variety of sources, including neurotoxicological data already in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
literature, structure-activity relationships, data from first-tier testing, or following reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific neurotoxic effects in humans exposed to the agent. Testing at the secondary level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes detailed neuropathological evaluation as well as specific behavioral tests, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to assess learning and memory, or sensory function. Tests at the second tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually measure the most sensitive endpoints of neurotoxicity, and are the most suitable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the no observable adverse effect level or benchmark dose. At this stage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, the use of a second species is considered to address the issue of cross-species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extrapolation. At the present time, tiered testing approaches in neurotoxicology rely heavily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on functional endpoints. It is possible that future testing protocols will employ a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strategy as more information concerning neurotoxic mechanisms of action become available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and biologically based dose-response models are developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4.2.2. Dosing Regimen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Goldberg and Frazier (1989) have indicated that first-tier evaluations identify effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of substances following acute or repeated exposure over a wide range of doses. Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are simple, focused on detection of effects, and results are used to help establish parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the second tier of testing. The subsequent stage(s) of tier testing are designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize more fully the toxicity of repeated dosing. In this case, animals are exposed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As applied to the safety assessment of chemical substances, neurotoxicity is any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse change in the development, structure, or function of the central and peripheral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system following exposure to a chemical agent (Tilson, 1990b). Measures used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal neurotoxicological studies are designed to assess these changes. Neurotoxicity can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described at multiple levels of organization, including chemical, anatomical, physiological, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavioral levels. At the chemical level, for example, a neurotoxic substance might inhibit protein 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or transmitter synthesis, alter the flow of ions across cellular membranes, or prevent release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of neurotransmitter from nerve terminals. Anatomical changes may include destruction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the neuron, axon, or myelin sheath. At the physiological level, neuronal responsiveness to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimulation might be enhanced by a decrease of inhibitory thresholds in the nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical-induced effects at the behavioral level can involve a variety of alterations in motor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensory, or cognitive function, including increases or decreases in frequency or accuracy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding. Although behavioral and neurophysiological endpoints may be very sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators of neurotoxicity, they can be influenced by other factors. The uncertainties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with data from functional endpoints can be reduced if interpreted within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of other neurotoxicological measures (neurochemical or neuropathological) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systemic toxicity endpoints, particularly if such measures are taken concurrently. Behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects that reflect an indirect effect secondary to systemic toxicities may also be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse. Table 4&hyph;1 provides examples of potential endpoints of neurotoxicity at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavioral, physiological, chemical, and structural levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Neurotoxicants produce a wide array of functional deficits, including motor, sensory, and learning or memory dysfunction
(WHO, 1986; Tilson and Mitchell, 1984). Many procedures have been devised to assess overt as well as relatively subtle
changes in those functions; hence their applicability to the detection of neurotoxicity and to hazard characterization.
Many of the behavioral tests have been developed and validated with well-characterized neurotoxicants. Behavioral
tests and agents that affect them have been reviewed recently (WHO, 1986; Cory-Slechta, 1989). Examples of such tests,
the nervous system function being measured, and neurotoxicants known to affect these measures are listed in Table

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
 Functional observational batteries are first-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests designed to detect and quantify major overt behavioral, physiological, and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic effects (Moser, 1989). A number of batteries have been used (Tilson and Moser, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992), each consisting of tests generally intended to evaluate various aspects of sensorimotor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. Most FOB are similar to clinical neurological examinations that rate presence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence and, in some cases, the relative degree of neurological signs. A typical FOB, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarized in Table 4&hyph;3, evaluates several functional domains, including neuromuscular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., weakness, incoordination, gait, and tremor), sensory (i.e., audition, vision, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
somatosensory), and autonomic (i.e., pupil response and salivation) function.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The major advantages of FOB tests are that they can be administered within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of other ongoing toxicological tests and provide some indication of the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological alterations produced by exposure. Potential problems include insufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interobserver reliability, difficulty in defining certain endpoints, and the tendency toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observer bias. The latter can be controlled by using observers unaware of the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment of the subjects. Some FOB tests may not be very sensitive to agent-induced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensory loss (i.e., vision, audition) or alterations in cognitive or integrative processes such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
learning and memory. FOB data may be used to trigger experiments performed at the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tier of testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOB data may be interval, ordinal, or continuous (Creason, 1989). The relevance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant test results from an FOB is judged according to the number of signs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected, the dose(s) at which neurotoxic signs are observed, and the nature, severity, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persistence of the effects. Data from the FOB may provide presumptive evidence of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects and neurotoxicity. If only a few unrelated measures in the FOB are affected or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects are unrelated to dose, there is less concern about neurotoxic potentials of a chemical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If dose is associated with other overt signs of toxicity, including systemic toxicity, large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreases in body weight, or debilitation, the data must be interpreted carefully. In cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where several related measures in a battery of tests are affected and the effects appear to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose dependent, the level of concern about the potential of a chemical is higher.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response and can be affected by environmental agents. Motor activity represents a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class of behaviors involving coordinated participation of sensory, motor, and integrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. Motor activity measurements are noninvasive and can be used to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of acute and repeated exposure to chemicals (MacPhail et al., 1989). Motor activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements have also been used in humans to evaluate disease states, including disorders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the nervous system (Goldstein and Stein, 1985). The assessment of motor activity is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in first-tier evaluations, either as part of the FOB or as a separate quantitated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many different types of activity measurement devices, differing in size, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shape, and method of movement detection (MacPhail et al., 1989). Because of the accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and ease of calibration, devices with photocells are widely used. In general, situating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparatus to minimize extraneous noise, movements, or lights usually requires that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording devices be placed in light- and sound-attenuating chambers during the testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. A number of different factors, including age, gender, and time of day, can affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor activity, and should be controlled or counterbalanced. Different strains of animals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have significantly different basal levels of activity, making comparisons across studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult. A major factor in activity studies is the duration of the testing session. Motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity levels are generally highest at the beginning of the session and decrease to a low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level throughout the session. The rate of decline during the test session is frequently termed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``habituation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motor activity measurements are typically included as part of a battery of tests to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detect or characterize neurotoxicity. Agent-induced alterations in motor activity associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with overt signs of toxicity (e.g., loss of body weight, systemic toxicity) or occurring in non-dose-related fashion
are of less concern than changes that are dose dependent, related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural or other functional changes in the nervous system, or occur in the absence of life-threatening toxicity
and are generally convincing evidence of neurotoxicity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Motor dysfunction is a common neurotoxic effect, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many different types of tests have been devised to measure time- and dose-dependent effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anger (1984) reported 14 motor effects of 89 substances, which could be classified into four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
categories: weakness, incoordination, tremor, and myoclonia or spasms. Chemical-induced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in motor function can be determined with relatively simple techniques such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FOB. More specialized tests to assess weakness include measures of grip strength, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swimming endurance, suspension from a hanging rod, discriminitive motor function, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hindlimb splay. Rotarod and gait assessments measure incoordination, while rating scales 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and spectral analysis techniques quantify tremor and other abnormal movements (Tilson and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitchell, 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example of a second-tier procedure to assess motor function has been described by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Newland (1988), who trained squirrel monkeys to hold a bar within specified limits (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement) to receive positive reinforcement. The bar was also attached to a rotary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device, which allowed measurement of chemical-induced tremor. Spectral analysis was used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to characterize the tremor, which was found to be similar to that seen in humans exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicants or with such neurologic diseases as Parkinson's disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Incoordination and performance changes can be assessed with procedures that measure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical-induced alterations in force (Fowler, 1987). The accuracy of performance may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect neuromotor function and is sensitive to the debilitating effects of many psychoactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs (Walker et al., 1981; Newland, 1988). Gait, an index of coordination, has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measured in rats under standardized conditions and can be a sensitive indication of specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage to the basal ganglia and motor cortex (Hruska et al., 1979) as well as damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures to characterize chemical-induced motor dysfunction have been used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensively in neurotoxicology. Most require preexposure training (including alterations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motivational state) of experimental animals, but such tests might be useful, in as much as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar procedures are often used in assessing humans.

4.3.2.4. Sensory function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Alterations in sensory processes (e.g., paresthesias and visual or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
auditory impairments) are frequently reported signs or symptoms in humans exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicants (Anger, 1984). Several approaches have been devised to measure sensory deficits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from tests of sensory function must be interpreted within the context of changes in body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, body temperature, and other physiological endpoints. Furthermore, many tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assess the behavioral response of an animal to a specific sensory stimulus; such responses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually motor movements that could be directly affected by chemical exposure. Thus, care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be taken to determine whether proper controls were included to eliminate the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that changes in response to a sensory stimulus may have been related to agent-induced motor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dysfunction.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Several first-tier testing procedures have been devised to screen for overt sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficits. Many rely on orientation or the response of an animal to a stimulus. Such tests are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually included in the FOB used in screening (e.g., tail-pinch or click responses). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses are usually recorded as being either present, absent, or changed in magnitude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Moser, 1989; O'Donoghue, 1989). Screening tests for sensory deficits are typically not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable to characterize chemical-induced changes in acuity or fields of perception. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization of sensory deficits usually necessitates psychophysical methods that study the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the physical dimensions of a stimulus and the behavioral response it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generates (Maurissen, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One second-tier approach to the characterization of sensory function involves the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reflex-modification techniques (Crofton, 1990). Chemical-induced changes in the stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency or threshold required to inhibit a reflex are taken as possible changes in sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. Prepulse inhibition has been used only recently in neurotoxicology (Fechter and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Young, 1983) and can be used to assess sensory function in humans as well as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental animals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various behavioral procedures require that a learned response occur only in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of a specific stimulus (i.e., discriminated or conditioned responding). Chemical-induced changes in
sensory function are determined by altering the physical characteristics of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the stimulus (e.g., magnitude or frequency) and measuring the alteration in response rate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy. In an example of the use of a discriminated conditional response to assess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical-induced sensory dysfunction, Maurissen et al. (1983) trained monkeys to respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the presence of a vibratory or electric stimulus applied to the fingertip. Repeated dosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with acrylamide produced a persistent decrease in vibration sensitivity; sensitivity to electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimulation was unimpaired. That pattern of sensory dysfunction corresponded well to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known sensory deficits in humans. Discriminated conditional response procedures have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to assess the ototoxicity produced by toluene (Pryor et al., 1983) and the visual toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by methylmercury (Merigan, 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures to characterize chemical-induced sensory dysfunction have been used often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in neurotoxicology. As in the case of most procedures designed to characterize nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system dysfunction, training and motivational factors can be confounding factors. Many tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to assess sensory function for laboratory animals can also be applied with some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adaptation to humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

4.3.2.5. Learning and memory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Learning and memory disorders are neurotoxic effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular importance. Impairment of memory is reported fairly often by adult humans as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequence of toxic exposure. Behavioral deficits in children have been caused by lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (Smith et al., 1989), and it is hypothesized (Calne et al., 1986) that chronic low-level exposure to toxic
agents may have a role in the pathogenesis of senile dementia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Learning can be defined as an enduring change in the mechanisms of behavior that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results from experience with environmental events (Domjan and Burkhard, 1986). Memory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a change that can be either short-lasting or long-lasting (Eckerman and Bushnell, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alterations in learning and memory must be inferred from changes in behavior. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in learning and memory must be separated from other changes in behavior that do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not involve cognitive or associative processes (e.g., motor function, sensory capabilities, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motivational factors), and an apparent toxicant-induced change in learning or memory should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be demonstrated over a range of stimuli and conditions. Before it is concluded that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicant alters learning and memory, effects should be confirmed in a second learning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure. It is well known that lesions in the brain can inhibit learning. It is also known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some brain lesions can facilitate some types of learning by removing behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendencies (e.g., inhibitory responses due to stress) that moderate the rate of learning under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal circumstances. A discussion of learning procedures and examples of chemicals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can affect learning and memory have appeared in recent reviews (Heise, 1984; WHO, 1986; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Peele and Vincent, 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One simple index of learning and memory, which can be measured as a first-tier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoint, is habituation. Habituation is defined as a gradual decrease in the magnitude or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency of a response after repeated presentations of a stimulus. A toxicant can affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habituation by increasing or decreasing the number of stimulus presentations needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce response decrements (Overstreet, 1977). Although habituation is a very simple form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of learning, it can also be perturbed by a number of chemical effects not related to learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A more complicated approach to studying the effects of a chemical on learning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
memory involves the pairing of a novel stimulus with a second stimulus that produces a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known, observable, and quantifiable response (i.e., classical ``Pavlovian'' conditioning). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
novel stimulus is known as the conditioned stimulus, and the second, eliciting stimulus is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unconditioned stimulus. With repeated pairings of the two stimuli, the conditioned stimulus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comes to elicit a response similar to the response elicited by the unconditioned stimulus. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure has been used in behavioral pharmacology and, to a lesser extent, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicology. Neurotoxicants that interfere with learning and memory would alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of presentations of the pair of stimuli required to produce conditioning or learning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Memory would be tested by determining how long after the last presentation of the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stimuli the conditioned stimulus would still elicit a response (Yokel, 1983). Other classically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioned responses known to be affected by psychoactive or neurotoxic agents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditioned taste aversion (Riley and Tuck, 1985) and conditioned suppression (Chiba and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ando, 1976). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second-tier procedures to assess learning or memory typically involve the pairing of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response with a stimulus that increases the probability of future response through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcement. Response rate can be increased by using positive reinforcement or removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative reinforcement. Learning is usually assessed by determining the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentations or trials needed to produce a defined frequency of response. Memory can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined specifically as the maintenance of a stated frequency of response after initial training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxicants may adversely affect learning by increasing or decreasing the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presentations required to achieve the designated criterion. Decrements in memory may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by a decrease in the probability or frequency of a response at some time after initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. Toxicant-induced changes in learning and memory should be interpreted within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context of possible toxicant-induced changes in sensory, motor, and motivational factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of instrumental learning procedures used in neurotoxicology are repeated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquisition (Schrot et al., 1984), passive and active avoidance, Y-maze avoidance, spatial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mazes (radial-arm maze), and delayed matching to sample (Heise, 1984; WHO, 1986; Tilson 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Mitchell, 1984).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Another type of second-tier procedure is schedule-controlled operant behavior (SCOB), which involves the maintenance
of behavior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(performance) by response-dependent reinforcement (Rice, 1988). Different patterns of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior and response rates are controlled by the relationship between response and later 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcement. SCOB affords a measure of learned behavior and with appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental design may be useful for studying chemical-induced effects on motor, sensory, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cognitive function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary endpoints for evaluation are agent-induced changes in response rate or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency and the temporal pattern of responding. Response rate is usually related to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective response, such as lever press or key peck, and differs according to the schedule of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reinforcement. Response rates are expressed per unit of time. For some classes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemicals, the direction of an effect on response rate can differ between low and high doses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agent-induced changes in temporal pattern of responding can occur independently of changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the rate and require analysis of the distribution of responses relative to reinforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SCOB has been used to study the effects of psychoactive drugs on behavior and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive to many neurotoxicants, including methylmercury, solvents, pesticides, acrylamides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carbon monoxide, and organic and inorganic lead (Paule and McMillan, 1984; MacPhail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985; Cory-Slechta, 1989; Rice, 1988). The experimental animal often serves as its own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, and the procedure provides an opportunity to study a few animals extensively over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively long period. SCOB typically requires motivational procedures, such as food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deprivation, and training sessions are usually required to establish a stable baseline of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responding. Because of its sensitivity to neuroactive chemicals, SCOB has great potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in second-tier assessments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Neurophysiological studies are those that assess function either directly through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements of the electrical activity of the nervous system (electrophysiology) or indirectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through measurements of peripheral organ functions controlled or modulated by the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system (general physiology) (Dyer, 1987). When performed properly, neurophysiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
techniques provide information on the integrity of defined portions of the nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the endpoints used in animals have also been used in humans to determine chemical-induced alterations in neurophysiological
function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``electrophysiology'' refers to the set of neurophysiological procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study neural function through the direct measurement of the electrical activity generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nervous system (Dyer, 1987). A variety of electrophysiological procedures are available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for application to neurotoxicological problems, which range in scale from procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employ microelectrodes to study the function of single nerve cells or restricted portions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them, to procedures that employ macroelectrodes to perform simultaneous recordings of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summed activity of many cells. The latter types of procedures have historically been used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies to detect or characterize the potential neurotoxicity of agents of regulatory interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several macroelectrode procedures are discussed below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
4.3.3.1. Nerve conduction studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Nerve conduction studies are generally performed on peripheral nerves and can be useful in investigations of possible
peripheral neuropathy. Most peripheral nerves contain mixtures of both individual sensory and motor nerve fibers,
which may or may not be differentially sensitive to neurotoxicants. It is possible to distinguish sensory from motor
effects in peripheral nerve studies by measuring activity in purely sensory nerves such as the sural to study sensory
effects or by measuring the muscle response evoked by nerve stimulation to measure motor effects. While a number of
endpoints can be recorded, the most commonly used variables are (1) Nerve conduction velocity, and (2) response amplitude.
In well-controlled studies, decreases in nerve conduction velocity typically are evidence of neurotoxicity (Dyer,
1987). While a decrease in nerve conduction velocity is a reliable measure of demyelination, it frequently occurs
rather late in the course of axonal degradation because normal conduction velocity may be maintained for some time
in the face of axonal degeneration. For this reason, a measurement of normal nerve conduction velocity does not necessarily
rule out peripheral axonal degeneration if other signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction are present. Increases in
conduction velocity of adult organisms following treatment with neurotoxic compounds, in the absence of hypothermia,
are atypical responses and may, in fact, reflect experimental or statistical errors. Decreases in response amplitude
reflect a loss of active nerve fibers, and may occur prior to decreases in conduction velocity in the course of peripheral
neuropathy. Hence changes in response amplitude may be more sensitive measurements of axonal degeneration than
conduction velocity. Measurements of response amplitude, however, are more variable and require careful experimental
techniques, a larger sample size, and greater statistical power than measurements of velocity to detect changes.
Alterations in peripheral nerve function are associated with abnormal peripheral sensations such as numbness,
tingling, or burning or with motor impairments such as weakness. Examples of compounds that alter peripheral nerve
function in humans or experimental animals at some level of exposure include acrylamide, carbon disulfide, hexacarbons,
lead, and some organophosphates.

4.3.3.2. Sensory evoked potentials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Sensory evoked potentials are electrophysiological procedures that involve measuring the response elicited by
the presentation of a defined sensory stimulus such as a tone, a light, or a brief electrical pulse to the skin. Sensory
evoked potentials reflect sensory function, and can be used to investigate visual, auditory, or somatosensory (body
sensation) systems (Rebert, 1983; Mattsson and Albee, 1988). The data are in the form of a voltage record over time,
which can be quantified in several ways. Commonly, the positive and negative voltage peaks are identified and measured
as to their latency (time from stimulus onset) and amplitude (voltage). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in peak amplitudes or equivalent measures reflect changes in the magnitude of the neural population that
is responsive to stimulation. Both increases and decreases in amplitude are possible following exposure to neurotoxicants
because (1) The brain normally operates in a careful balance between excitatory and inhibitory systems, and disruption
of this balance can produce either positive or negative shifts in the voltages recorded in evoked potential experiments,
and (2) excitatory or inhibitory neural activity is translated into a positive or negative deflection in the sensory
evoked potential depending on the physical orientation of the electrode with respect to the tissue generating the
response, which is frequently unknown. Within any given sensory system, the neural circuits that generate the different
evoked potential peaks differ as a function of peak latency. In general, early latency peaks reflect the transmission
of afferent sensory information, and changes in either the latency or amplitude of these peaks generally indicate
a neurotoxic change that is likely to be reflected in deficits in sensory perception. The later latency peaks, in general,
reflect not only the sensory input, but also the more nonspecific factors such as the behavioral state of the subject
including such factors as arousal level, habituation, or sensitization. Thus, the neurotoxicological significance
of changes in later latency evoked potential peaks must be interpreted in light of the behavioral status of the subject.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Observable behavioral convulsions in animals may be indicative of central nervous system seizure activity. However,
behavioral convulsions that occur only at lethal or near lethal dose levels may reflect an indirect effect secondary
to systemic toxicity and not directly on the nervous system. Convulsions occurring at dose levels that are clearly
sublethal, and in the absence of apparent systemic toxicity, are more likely due to a direct effect on the nervous system.
In such cases, neurophysiological recordings of electrical activity in the brain that are indicative of seizures
may provide additional evidence of direct neurotoxicity. In addition to producing seizures, chemicals may also
affect seizure susceptibility, altering the frequency, severity, duration, or threshold for eliciting seizures
produced through other means. Such changes can occur after acute exposure or after repeated exposure to dose levels
below the acute threshold, and are considered neurotoxic. Agents that produce convulsions include lindane, DDT,
pyrethroids, and trimethyltin (WHO, 1986). Some agents, including many solvents, act to raise the threshold for
eliciting seizures through other means or otherwise act to reduce the severity or duration of the elicited convulsions.
These agents are difficult to classify as neurotoxic based on such data, but frequently have other effects on which
a determination of neurotoxic potential can be based.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EEG analysis is used widely in clinical settings for the diagnosis of neurological disorders and less often for the
detection of subtle toxicant-induced dysfunction (WHO, 1986; Eccles, 1988). The basis for the use of EEG in either
setting is the relationship between specific patterns of EEG waveforms and specific behavioral states. Because
states of alertness and the stages of sleep are associated with distinct patterns of electrical activity in the brain,
it is generally thought that arousal level can be evaluated by monitoring the EEG. Dissociation of EEG activity and
behavior can, however, occur after exposure to certain chemicals. Normal patterns of transition between sleep stages
or between sleeping and waking states are known to remain disturbed for prolonged periods of time following exposure
to certain chemical classes (e.g., organophosphates). Changes in the pattern of the EEG can be elicited by stimuli
producing arousal (e.g., lights, sounds) and neuroactive drugs. In studies with toxicants, changes in EEG pattern
can sometimes precede alterations in other objective signs of neurotoxicity. EEG experiments must be done under
highly controlled conditions, and the neurotoxicological significance of chemical-induced changes in the EEG
in the absence of other signs of neurotoxicity must be considered on a case-by-case basis. Many chemicals, including
metals, solvents, and pesticides, would be expected to affect the EEG.

EMG involves making electrical recordings from muscle and has been used extensively in human clinical studies in
the diagnosis of certain diseases of the muscle (WHO, 1986). Changes in the EMG include amplitude and firing frequency
of spontaneous firing; evoked muscle responses to nerve stimulation can be used to study alterations in the neuromuscular
junction. EMG has been used to study toxicant-induced changes in neuromuscular function, including organophosphate
insecticides, methyl

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Segmental spinal monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes are relatively simple functions in the central nervous
system that can be evaluated by quantitative techniques (WHO, 1986). Many of the procedures used in animals are similar
to procedures used clinically to perform neurological tests in humans. One approach infers the functional state
of a reflex arc from either the latency and magnitude of the reflex response evoked by stimuli of predetermined intensity
or from the stimulus intensity required to elicit a detectable response (i.e., the threshold). This approach is used
best in a screening context and the significance of effects in this test should be considered on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second more involved approach records electrophysiologically the time required for a stimulus applied to a peripheral
nerve to reach the spinal cord and return to the site of the original stimulation. Data from this procedure can indicate
the excitability of the motoneuron pool, an effect seen with many volatile solvents. Although this approach is more
invasive and time-consuming than the noninvasive procedure, it provides better data concerning the possible site
of action. In addition, the manner in which the invasive procedure is carried out (i.e., in decerebrated animals)
precludes repeated testing on the same animal. The significance of effects in this procedure should also be considered
on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Neuronal function within the nervous system is dependent on synthesis and release of specific neurotransmitters
and activation of their receptors in specific neuronal pathways. With few exceptions, neurochemical measurements
are invasive and therefore used infrequently in human risk assessment. There are many different neurochemical endpoints
that could be measured in neurotoxicological studies (Bondy, 1986; Mailman, 1987; Morell and Mailman, 1987). Neurotoxicants
can interfere with the ionic balance of a neuron, act as a cytotoxicant after being transported into a nerve terminal,
block uptake of neurotransmitter precursors, act as a metabolic poison, overstimulate receptors, block transmitter
release, and inhibit transmitter degradation. Table 4&hyph;4 lists several chemicals with known neurochemical
effects. Many neuroactive agents can increase or decrease neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Dose-related changes
on these endpoints may indicate a chemical effect on the nervous system, but the neurotoxicological significance
of such changes must be interpreted in the context of other signs of neurotoxicity.

Some chemicals, such as the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, are known to interfere with a specific enzyme,
acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Costa, 1988). Inhibition of this enzyme in brain may be considered evidence of neurotoxicity,
whereas decreases in AChE in the blood, which can be easily determined in humans, are only suggestive of a neurotoxic
effect. A subset of organophosphate agents produces organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy (OPIDN) after
acute or repeated exposure. Neurotoxic esterase (or neuropathy target enzyme, NTE) has been associated with agents
that produce OPIDN (Johnson, 1990).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate functional significance of many biochemical changes is not known; therefore it may be difficult to determine
if a specific biochemical change can be considered adverse or convincing evidence of neurotoxicity. Any such change,
however, is potentially adverse and each determination of adversity requires a judgment to be made. Likewise, the
absence of specific biochemical testing protocols does not mean biochemical changes are of no concern, but instead
reflects a lack of understanding of the significance of changes at the biochemical level.

The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) comprises nerve cells or neurons, which consist of a neuronal body,
axon, and dendritic processes. Various types of neuropathological lesions may be classified according to their
nature or the site where they are found (WHO, 1986; Krinke, 1989; Griffin, 1990). Lesions may be classified as neuropathy
(changes in the neuronal body), axonopathy (changes in the axons), myelinopathy (changes in the myelin sheaths),
neurodegeneration (changes in the nerve terminals), and peripheral neuropathy (changes in the peripheral nerves).
For axonopathies, a more precise location of the changes should be described (i.e., proximal, central, or distal
axonopathy). In some cases, agents produce neuropathic conditions that resemble naturally occurring neurodegenerative
disorders in humans (WHO, 1986). Table 4&hyph;5 lists examples of such chemicals, their known site of action, the
type of neuropathology produced, and the disease or condition that each typifies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In general, chemical effects lead to two types of primary cellular alteration: (l) the accumulation, proliferation,
or rearrangement of structural elements (e.g., intermediate filaments, microtubules) or organelles (mitochondria)
and (2) the breakdown of cells, in whole or in part. The latter can be associated with regenerative processes that may
occur during chemical exposure. Such changes are considered to be neurotoxic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While most neurotoxic damage is evident at the microscopic level, gross changes in morphology can be reflected by
a significant change in the weight of the brain. Weight changes (absolute or relative to body weight), discoloration,
discrete or massive cerebral hemorrhage, or obvious lesions in nerve tissue are generally considered neurotoxic
effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical-induced injury to the central nervous system is associated with astrocytic hypertrophy at the site of damage.
Assays of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the major intermediate filament protein of astrocytes, has been
proposed as a biomarker of this response (O'Callaghan, 1988). A number of chemicals known to injure the central nervous
system, including trimethyltin, methylmercury, cadmium, 3-acetylpyridine, and MPTP, have been shown to increase
GFAP. In addition, increases in GFAP may be seen at dosages below those necessary to produce cytopathology as determined
by Nissl-based stains used in standard neuropathological examinations. Because increases in GFAP may be an early
indicator of neuronal injury in the adult, exposure level-dependent increases in GFAP should be viewed with concern.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical-induced alterations in the structure of the nervous system are generally considered neurotoxic effects.
To ensure reliable data, it is important that neuropathological studies minimize fixation artifacts and potential
differences in the section(s) of the nervous system sampled and control for variability due to the age, sex, and body
weight of the subject (WHO, 1986).

Exposure to chemicals during development can result in effects other than death, gross structural abnormality,
or altered growth. There are several instances in which functional alterations have resulted from exposure during
the period between conception and sexual maturity (Riley and Vorhees, 1986; Vorhees, 1987). Table 4&hyph;6 lists
several examples of chemicals known to produce developmental neurotoxicity in experimental animals. Animal models
of developmental neurotoxicity have been shown to be sensitive to several environmental chemicals known to produce
developmental toxicity in humans, including lead, ethanol, methylmercury, and PCBs (Kimmel et al., 1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Sometimes functional defects are observed at dose levels below those at which other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators of developmental toxicity are evident (Rodier, 1986). Such effects may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient or reversible in nature, but generally are considered adverse effects. Data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postnatal studies, when available, are considered useful for further assessment of the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance and severity of findings in the fetus and neonate. Often, the long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequences of adverse developmental outcomes noted at birth are unknown and further data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on postnatal development and function are necessary to determine the full spectrum of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential developmental effects. Useful data also can be derived from well-conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multigeneration studies, although the dose levels used in these studies may be much lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than those in studies with shorter-term exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much of the early work in developmental neurotoxicology was related to behavioral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations. Recent advances in this area have been reviewed in several publications (Riley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Vorhees, 1986; Kimmel et al., 1990). Several expert groups have focused on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions that should be included in a behavioral testing battery, including sensory systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuromotor development, locomotor activity, learning and memory, reactivity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habituation, and reproductive behavior. No testing battery has fully addressed all of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functions, but it is important to include as many as possible, and several testing batteries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been developed and evaluated for use in testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct extrapolation of functional developmental effects to humans is limited in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same way as for other endpoints of developmental toxicity, i.e., by the lack of knowledge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about underlying toxicological mechanisms and their significance. It can be assumed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional effects in animal studies indicate the potential for altered development in humans, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the types of developmental effects seen in experimental animal studies will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily be the same as those that may be produced in humans. Thus, when data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functional developmental toxicity studies are encountered for particular agents, they should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered in the risk assessment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agents that produce developmental neurotoxicity at a dose that is not toxic to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maternal animal are of special concern because the developing organism is affected but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity is not apparent in the adult. More commonly, however, adverse developmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects are produced only at doses that cause minimal maternal toxicity; in these cases, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental effects are still considered to represent developmental toxicity and should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be discounted as secondary to maternal toxicity. At doses causing excessive maternal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity (that is, significantly greater than the minimal toxic dose), information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developmental effects may be difficult to interpret and of limited value. Current information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is inadequate to assume that developmental effects at maternally toxic doses result only from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maternal toxicity; it may be that the mother and developing organism are sensitive to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose level. Moreover, whether developmental effects are secondary to maternal toxicity or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not, the maternal effects may be reversible while effects on the offspring may be permanent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are important considerations for agents to which humans may be exposed at minimally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic levels either voluntarily or involuntarily, because several agents are known to produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse developmental effects at minimally toxic doses in adult humans (e.g., smoking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alcohol). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although interpretation of functional developmental neurotoxicity data may be limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at present, it is clear that functional effects must be evaluated in light of other toxicity data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including other forms of developmental toxicity (e.g., structural abnormalities, perinatal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death, and growth retardation). The level of confidence in an adverse effect may be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important as the type of change seen, and confidence may be increased by such factors as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replicability of the effect either in another study of the same function or by convergence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from tests that purport to measure similar functions. A dose-response relationship is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered an important measure of chemical effect; in the case of functional effects, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monotonic and biphasic dose-response curves are likely, depending on the function being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested.

4.3.7. Physiological and Neuroendocrine Endpoints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
One of the key roles played by the nervous system is to orchestrate the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physiological functions of the body to help maintain homeostasis. To this end, the nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and many of the peripheral organ systems are integrated and functionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interdependent. For example, specific neuronal processes are intimately involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining or modulating respiration, cardiovascular function, body temperature, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gastrointestinal function. Because many peripheral organ functions involve neuronal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components, changes in such physiological endpoints as blood pressure, heart rate, EKG, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body temperature, respiration, lacrimation, or salivation may indirectly reflect possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment-related effects on the functional integrity of the nervous system. However, since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physiological endpoints also depend on the integrity of the related peripheral organ itself, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in physiological function also may reflect a systemic toxicity involving that organ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the neurotoxicological significance of a physiological change must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpreted within the context of other signs of toxicity. A variety of general physiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures can be applied to neurotoxicological problems. These procedures range in scale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from simple measurements, for example, of body temperature, respiration, lacrimation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salivation, urination, and defecation, which may be included in routine functional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observational batteries used for chemical screening, to more involved procedures involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements of blood pressure, endocrine responses, cardiac function, gastrointestinal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function, etc. The latter would be more appropriate for second-level tests to characterize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope of chemically related toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The central nervous system also regulates the outflow of the endocrine system, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together with the influence of the autonomic nervous system, can affect immunologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function (WHO, 1986). Hormonal balance results from the integrated action of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hypothalamus, located in the central nervous system, and the pituitary, which regulates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities of endocrine target organs. Each site is susceptible to disruption by neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents. Neuroendocrine dysfunction may occur because of a disturbance in the regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and modulation of the neuroendocrine feedback systems. One major indicator of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuroendocrine function is secretions of hormones from the pituitary. Hormones from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anterior pituitary are important for reproduction (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hormone), growth (thyroid-stimulating hormone), and response to stress (adrenocorticotropic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hormone). Hypothalamic control of anterior pituitary secretions occurs through the release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hypothalamic-hypophysiotropic hormones. Hormones from the posterior hypothalamus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(prolactin, melanocyte-stimulating hormone, and growth hormone) are also involved in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of important bodily functions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Many types of behaviors (e.g., reproductive behaviors, sexually dimorphic behaviors) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are dependent on the integrity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system, which could represent an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important site for neurotoxic action. Pituitary secretions arise from a number of different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cell types in this gland and neurotoxicants could affect these cells either directly or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirectly. Morphological changes in follicular cells, chromophobe cells, somatotropic cells, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prolactin cells, gonadotropic cells, follicle-stimulating hormone secreting cells, luteinizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hormone-containing cells, thyrotropic cells, and cortico cells might be associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects on the pituitary, which could ultimately affect behavior and the functioning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biochemical changes in the hypothalamus also may be used as indices of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in neuroendocrine function. However, the neuroendocrine significance of changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hypothalamic neurotransmitters and neuropeptides is usually only inferential and data must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most anterior pituitary hormones are subject to negative feedback control by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
peripheral endocrine glands and, if neurotoxicants modify peripheral secretions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuroendocrine changes can result from this altered feedback. Modifications in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning of these endocrine secretions could occur after toxic exposure; a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents have been shown to alter blood levels of glucocorticoids, thyroxine, estrogen, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corticosterone, and testosterone. Although such changes are not necessarily due to direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neuroendocrine effects, target organ changes often can be a first indication of neuroendocrine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes.

4.3.8. Other Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.3.8.1. Structure-activity relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Because of a general lack of epidemiologic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicologic data on most chemical substances, attempts have been made in toxicology to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predict activities based on chemical structure. The basis for inference from structure-activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationships (SARs) can be either comparison with structures known to have biologic activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or knowledge of structural requirements of a receptor or macromolecular site of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, given the complexity of the nervous system and the lack of information on biologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms of neurotoxic action, there are relatively few well-characterized SARs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicology. Since SARs cannot be used to rule out all neurotoxic activity, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to use them as a basis for excluding potential neurotoxicity. Caution is warranted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interpreting SARs in anything other than the most preliminary analyses. Use of SARs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires detailed knowledge not only of structure, but also of each critical step in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenetic mechanism of neurotoxic injury. Such knowledge is still generally unavailable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAR approaches are more successful when the range of possible sites of action or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanisms of action is narrow. Thus, SARs have had more use in relation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenicity and mutagenicity than in other kinds of toxicity. The SAR approaches used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the development of novel neuropharmacologic structures deserve consideration in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicology, but their utility depends on a better understanding of neurotoxic mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
4.3.8.2. In vitro methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In vitro procedures for testing have practical advantages, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies must be done to correlate the results with responses in whole animals. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantage of validated in vitro tests is that they minimize the use of live animals. Some of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the more developed in vitro tests might be simple and might not have to be conducted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
highly trained personnel, but, as with many in vivo tests, the analysis and interpretation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results are likely to require expertise. Experience with the Ames test for mutagenesis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirms the advantages of in vitro procedures, but also illustrates the problems that arise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when an assay is used to predict an endpoint that is not exactly what it measures (e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenicity rather than specific aspects of genotoxicity). In vitro changes can be markers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for toxicity, even when the structural or functional consequences are not known or predicted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in vitro methods can examine the more evolutionarily conserved elements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system and improve neurotoxicity detection and could also provide suitable systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for studying developmental neurotoxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A broad range of tissue-culture systems are available for assessing the neurologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of environmental agents, including cell lines, dissociated cell cultures, reaggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultures, explant cultures, and organ cultures (Veronesi, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neuronal and glial cell lines are used extensively in neurobiology and have potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for neurotoxicological studies. They consist of populations of continuously dividing cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, when treated appropriately, stop dividing and exhibit differentiated neuronal or glial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properties. Neuronal lines can develop electric excitability, chemosensitivity, axon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formation, neurotransmitter synthesis and secretion, and synapse formation. Large quantities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cells can be generated routinely to develop extensive dose-response or other quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
When neural tissue, typically from fetal animals, is dissociated into a suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single cells, and the suspension is inoculated into tissue-culture dishes, the neurons and glia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive, grow, and establish functional neuronal networks. Such preparations have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made from most regions of the CNS and exhibit highly differentiated, site-specific properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that constitute an in vitro model of different portions of the CNS. Most of the neuronal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitter and receptor phenotypes can be demonstrated, and a variety of synaptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interactions can be studied. Glial cells are also present, and neuroglial interactions are a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prominent feature of the cultures. A substantial battery of assays (neurochemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiologic) is now available to assess the development of the cultures and to indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic effects of test agents added to the culture medium. Relatively pure populations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different cell types can be isolated and cultured, so that effects on specific cell types can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessed independently. Pure glial cells or neurons, or even specific neural categories, can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be prepared in this way and studied separately, or interaction between neurons and glial cells 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be studied at high resolution. The neurobiologic measures used to assess the effect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any agent can be very specific (for example, activity of neurotransmitter-related enzyme or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
binding of a receptor ligand) or global (for example, neuron survival or concentration of glial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fibrillary acidic protein). The two-dimensional character of the preparations makes them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly suited for morphologic evaluation, and detailed electrophysiologic studies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily performed. The toxic effects and mechanisms of anticonvulsants, excitatory amino 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acids, and various metals and divalent cations have been assessed with these preparations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cerebellar granular cell culture system, for example, has been exploited recently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies of the mechanism of alkyllead toxicity (Verity et al., 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A related preparation made from single-cell suspensions of neural tissue is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaggregate culture. Instead of being placed in culture dishes and allowed to settle onto the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface of the dishes, the cells are kept in suspension by agitation; under appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, they stick to one another and form aggregates of controllable size and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
composition. Typically, the cells in an aggregate organize and exhibit intercellular relations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are a function of, and bear some resemblance to, the brain region that was the source of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cells. The cells establish a three-dimensional, often laminated structure. Reaggregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cultures lend themselves to large-scale, quantitative experiments in which neurobiologic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables can be examined, although morphologic and ligand-binding studies are performed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less readily than with surface cultures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organotypic explant cultures also are closely related to the intact nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small pieces or slices of neural tissue are placed in culture and can be maintained for long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods with substantial maintenance of structural and cell-cell relations of intact tissue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific synaptic relations develop and can be maintained and evaluated, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
morphologically and electrophysiologically. Because all regions of the nervous system are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amenable to this sort of preparation, it is possible to analyze toxic agents that are active only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in specific regions of the central or peripheral nervous system. Explants can be made from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively thin slices of neural tissue, so detailed morphologic and intracellular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrophysiologic studies are possible. Their anatomic integrity is such that they capture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many of the cell-cell interactions characteristic of the intact nervous system while allowing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct, continuing evaluation of the effects of a potentially neurotoxic compound added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culture medium. The process of myelination has been studied extensively in explant cultures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and considerable neurotoxicologic information has been gained. A preparation similar to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explant culture is the organ culture, in which an entire organ, such as the inner ear or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ganglion, rather than slices or fragments, is grown in vitro. Obviously, only structures so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small that their viability is not compromised can be treated in this way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the technical ease of maintaining a culture varies inversely with the degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which it captures a spectrum of in vivo characteristics of nervous system behavior. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem of biotransformation of potentially neurotoxic compounds is shared by all, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the more complete systems (explant or organ cultures) might alleviate this problem in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific instances. In many culture systems, complex and ill-defined additives_such as fetal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calf serum, horse serum, and human placental serum_are used to promote cell survival. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of thoroughly described synthetic media are now available, however, and such fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined culture systems can be used where necessary.

5. Neurotoxicology Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
5.1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Risk assessment is an empirically based process used to estimate the risk that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure of an individual or population to a chemical, physical, or biological agent will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with an adverse effect. Generally, such effects can be quantified and the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability of their occurrence can be calculated. The risk assessment process usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves four steps: hazard identification, dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and risk characterization (NRC, 1983). Risk management is the process that applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information obtained through the risk assessment process to determine whether the assessed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk should be reduced and, if so, to what extent (NRC, 1983). In some cases, risk is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only factor considered in a decision to regulate exposure to a substance. Alternatively, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk posed by a substance is weighed against social, ethical, and medical benefits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic and technological factors in formulating a risk management decision. The risk-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
balancing approach is used by some agencies to consider the benefits as well as the risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with unrestricted or partially restricted use of a substance. The purpose of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chapter is to describe the risk assessment process as it has currently evolved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicology and present available options for quantitative risk assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 -->
5.2. The Risk Assessment Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
5.2.1. Hazard Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Agents that adversely affect the neurophysiological, neurochemical, or structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity of the nervous system or the integration of nervous system function expressed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified behavior may be classified as neurotoxicants (Tilson, 1990b). For hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification, the best or most generalizable studies would measure these changes in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exclusion of therapeutic agents, information on effects in humans is usually derived 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from case reports of accidental exposures and epidemiological studies. This type of data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affords less certainty regarding generalizability as well as less specific exposure information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in chapter 4, a common alternative method of data generation for hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification is the use of animal models. Animal models that measure behavioral, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiological, neurochemical, and structural effects have been developed and validated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies that employ these models to evaluate specific potential hazards are used to predict the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome of exposure to the same hazard in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
5.2.1.1. Human studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Information obtained through the evaluation of human exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data provides direct identification of neurotoxic hazards. This type of information is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally available from clinical trials required for the approval of therapeutic products for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human use. For the purposes of risk assessment of nontherapeutic substances, data on effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of exposure to humans come primarily from two types of studies, case reports and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiological (Friedlander and Hearn, 1980) (see chapter 3). Case studies can supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence of an agent's toxicity, but are often limited by both the qualitative nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs and symptoms reported and the nature of the exposure data. Epidemiological studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can provide data on the types of neurotoxic effects and the possible susceptibilities of certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations. Under appropriate considerations, they can generally provide convincing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable evidence of potential human neurotoxicity. As with case studies, however, often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only qualitative estimates of exposure can be obtained. Controlled laboratory studies have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential to provide adequate exposure and effects data for accurate hazard identification, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but ethical considerations place moral and practical restrictions on such studies except in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those instances where direct benefit to the subjects, as in the case of therapeutic agents, may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be expected. Excluding instances of therapeutic product development, most studies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to measuring the effects of acute, rather than long-term, exposure. This limits their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility in risk assessment because the effect of long-term, low-level exposure to a potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic agent is often the issue of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods available to evaluate neurotoxicity in humans include examination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurophysiological and behavioral parameters. Specific tests to measure neuromuscular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strength and coordination, alterations in sensation, deficits in learning and memory, changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in mood and personality, and disruptions of autonomic function are frequently employed (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chapter 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
5.2.1.2. Animal studies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
As discussed in chapter 4, animal models for many endpoints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity are available and widely used for hazard identification. Data from animal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies are frequently extrapolated to humans. For example, if exposure to an agent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produces neuropathology in an animal model, damage to a comparable structure in humans is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predicted. Similarly, biochemical and physiological effects observed in animals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commonly extrapolated to humans. Agents that produce alterations in the levels of specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enzymes in one animal species generally have the same effect in other species, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans. Neurophysiological endpoints also tend to be affected by the same manipulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
across species. Thus, an agent interfering with nerve conduction in an animal study is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed to have the same effect in humans. Behavioral studies in animals are also applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human hazard identification, although the correspondence between methods employed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals and humans is sometimes not as obvious. For this reason, behavioral methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed for neurotoxic hazard identification need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

5.2.1.3.1. Animal-to-human extrapolation. The use of animal data to identify hazard to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sexes is a constant concern. Overly conservative risk assessments, based on the assumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that humans are always more sensitive than a tested animal species, can result in poor risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management decisions. Conversely, an assumption of equivalent sensitivity in a case where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans actually are more sensitive to a given agent can result in underregulation that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a negative impact on human health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1.3.2. Susceptible populations. A related controversy concerns the use of data collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from adult organisms, animal or human, to predict hazards in potentially more sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations, such as the very young and the elderly, or in other groups, such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chronically ill. In some cases, identification of neurotoxicity hazard does not generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include subjects from either end of the human life span or from other than healthy subjects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty factors are used to adjust for more sensitive populations. In addition, single or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multigeneration reproductive studies in animals may provide a source of information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurological disorders, behavioral changes, autonomical dysfunction, neuroanatomical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anomalies, and other signs of neurotoxicity in the developing animal (chapter 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.2.1.3.3. Reversibility. For the most part, the basic principles of hazard identification are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the same for neurotoxicity as for any adverse effect on health. One notable exception, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, concerns the issue of reversibility and the special consideration that must be given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the inherent redundancy and plasticity of the nervous system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For many health effects, temporary, as opposed to permanent, effects are repaired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during a true recovery. Damage to many organ systems, if not severe, can be spontaneously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired. For example, damaged liver cells that may result in impaired liver function often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be replaced with new cells that function normally. The resulting restoration of liver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function can be viewed as recovery. In the central nervous system, cells generally do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover from severe damage and new cells do not replace them. When nervous system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery is observed, it may represent compensation requiring activation of cells that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously performing some other function, reactive synaptogenesis, or recovery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderately injured cells. While a damaged liver may recover due to the addition of new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cells, severe damage to nervous system cells results in a net loss of cells. This loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensatory capacity may not be noticed for many years and, when it does appear, it may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be manifest in a way seemingly unrelated to the original neurotoxic event. Lack of ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover from a neurotoxic event later in life or premature onset of signs of normal aging may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result. It is therefore important to consider the possibility that significant damage to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nervous system may have occurred in experiments where effects appear to be reversible.

5.2.1.3.4. Weight of evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
A ``weight of evidence'' approach to identifying an agent as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a neurotoxic hazard is almost always necessary. With the exception of therapeutic products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single, complete, controlled study of an agent's effects on the nervous system, conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an appropriate representative sample of humans, is rarely, if ever, possible. Rather, those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals charged with identifying hazard are usually confronted with a collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imperfect studies, often providing conflicting data (Barnes and Dourson, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several possible approaches, depending on the quality of the evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two examples are the use of data from only the most sensitive species tested and the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data from only species responding most like the human for any given endpoint. In assessing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity of therapeutic products, when human data are available and neurotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endpoints detected in animals can be clinically measured, the human findings supersede those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the nonclinical data base. Assuming that all available evidence is to be included, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations necessary for formulating a conclusion include the relative weights that should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be given to positive and negative studies. Sometimes positive studies are given more weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than negative ones, even when the quality of the studies is comparable. Experimental design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors such as the species tested, the number and gender of subjects evaluated, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of the test are given different weights when data from different studies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined. The route of exposure in a given study and its relevance to expected routes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human exposure are often a weighted factor. The issue of statistical significance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently debated. Some argue that an effect occurring at a statistically insignificant level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may nevertheless represent a biologically or toxicologically significant event, and should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
afforded the same weight as if the finding were statistically significant. In general, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only statistically significant measures should be considered in hazard identification. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power of various statistical measures is also considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
5.2.2. Dose-Response Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the second step of the risk assessment process, the dose-response assessment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the extent of damage or toxicity and dose of a toxic substance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various conditions of exposure is determined. Because several different kinds of responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be elicited by a single agent, more than one dose-response relationship may need to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed (e.g., neurochemical and morphological parameters). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When quantitative human dose-effect data are not available for a sufficient range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposures, other methods must be used to estimate exposure levels likely to produce adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects in humans. In the absence of human data, the dose-response assessment may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on tests performed in laboratory animals. Evidence for a dose-response relationship is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an important criterion in assessing neurotoxicity, although this may be based on limited data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from standard studies that often use only three dose groups and a control group (Barnes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dourson, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The most frequently used approach for risk assessment of neurotoxicants and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noncancer endpoints is the uncertainty- or safety-factor approach (Barnes and Dourson, 1988; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Kimmel, 1990). For example, within the EPA, this approach involves the determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference doses (RfDs) by dividing a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty factors that presumably account for interspecies differences in sensitivity (Barnes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Dourson, 1988). Generally, an uncertainty factor of 10 is used to allow for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially higher sensitivity in humans than in animals and another uncertainty factor of 10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is used to allow for variability in sensitivity among humans. Hence, the RfD is equal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NOAEL divided by 100. If the NOAEL cannot be established, it is replaced by the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) in the RfD calculation and an additional uncertainty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of 10 is introduced (i.e., the RfD equals the LOAEL divided by 1000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If more than one effect is observed in the animal bioassays, the effect occurring at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowest dose in the most sensitive animal species and gender is generally used as the basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimating the RfD (OTA, 1990). Sometimes, different RfDs can be calculated, depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on endpoint or species selected. Selection of safety factors may be influenced by several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations, including data available from humans, weight of evidence, type of toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insult, and probability of variations in responses among susceptible populations (e.g., very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
young or very old). Established guidelines have been accepted by several agencies that use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety-factor approach to account for intraspecies variability, cross-species extrapolation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and exposure duration. In some instances, comparisons between these predicted values and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimental data have been conducted and the results appear comparable for some selected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examples (Dourson and Stara, 1983; McMillan, 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The uncertainty-factor approach is based on the assumption that a threshold does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist, that there is a dose below which an effect does not change in incidence or severity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The threshold concept is complicated and controversial. As described by Sette and MacPhail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1992), there are several different ways in which the term threshold is used. Thresholds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined, in part, by the limit of detection of an assay. As the sensitivity of the analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method or bioassay is improved, the threshold might be adjusted downward, indicating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the true threshold had not been previously determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another problem inherent with an observation of no discernible effects at low doses is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is impossible to determine whether the risk is actually zero (i.e., the dose is below a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threshold dose) or whether the statistical resolving power of a study is inadequate to detect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small risks (Gaylor and Slikker, 1992). Every study has a statistical limit of detection that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depends on the number of individuals or animals involved. For example, it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively unusual to conduct an experiment on a neurotoxicant with as many as 100 animals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per dose. If no deleterious effects were observed in 100 animals at a particular dose, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be concluded that this dose level is below the threshold dose. However, we can only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be 95 percent confident that the true risk is less than 0.03. That is, if 3 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animals in a population actually develop a toxic effect at this dose, there is a 5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chance that a group of 100 animals would not show any effect. The observation of no toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects in an extremely large sample of 1,000 animals only indicates with 95 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence that the true risk is less than 0.003, etc. Because thresholds cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realistically demonstrated, they are therefore assumed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The notion of threshold may be useful in explaining mechanisms associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific types of toxicity. What little is known about mechanisms of neurotoxicity suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that both threshold and nonthreshold scenarios are possible (Silbergeld, 1990). However, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of the most studied neurotoxicants, lead, there has been a steady decline in exposure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels shown to have effects, suggesting to some that no threshold dose is apparent (Bondy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1985). Sette and MacPhail (1992) also consider the threshold as a mathematical assumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and as a population sensitivity and conclude that ``the idea of no threshold seems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimentally untestable.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RfD approach relies on single experimental observations (the NOAEL or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LOAEL) instead of complete dose-response curve data to calculate risk estimations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chemical interactions with biological systems are often specific, stereoselective, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturable. Examples include enzyme-substrate binding leading to substrate metabolism, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport, and receptor-binding, any or all of which may be a requirement of an agent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect or toxicity. Therefore, a chemical's dose-response curve may not be linear. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certainty of low-dose extrapolation has been determined to be markedly affected by the shape 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the dose-response curve (Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee on Protocols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Safety Evaluation, 1971). Therefore, the appropriate use of dose-response curve data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should enhance the certainty of risk estimations when thresholds are not assumed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dose-response models have generated considerable interest as more appropriate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative alternatives to the safety-factor approach in risk assessment. Rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely applying a ``fixed'' safety factor to the NOAEL (based on a single dose) to obtain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``safe'' dose, another approach uses data from the entire dose-response curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two fundamentally different approaches in the use of dose-response data to estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk have been developed. Dews and coworkers (Dews, 1986; Glowa and Dews, 1987; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Glowa et al., 1983) and Crump (1984) demonstrated an approach in which they used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information on the shape of the dose-response curve to estimate levels of exposure associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with relatively small effects (i.e., a 1, 5, or 10 percent change in a biological endpoint). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Dews and Crump fit a mathematical function to the data and provided an estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability in exposure levels associated with a relatively small effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An alternative approach developed by Gaylor and Slikker (1990) first establishes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mathematical relationship between a biological effect and the dose of a given chemical. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second step determines the distribution (variability) of individual measurements of biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects about the dose-response curve. The third step statistically defines an adverse or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``abnormal'' level of a biological effect in an untreated population. The fourth step estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the probability of an adverse or abnormal level as a function of dose utilizing the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the first three steps. The advantages of these dose-response models are that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage the generation and use of data needed to define a complete dose-response curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although more quantitative dose-response assessment models have emerged in recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, uncertainty remains as to what biological endpoints from which species with what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dosing regimen should be analyzed. Within a species, a given agent may produce a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of effects, including neurochemical, neuropathological, and behavioral effects. In other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, a chemical may produce alterations of one endpoint but not others (Slikker et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989). Species selection may also dramatically affect the outcome of risk assessments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parkinson-like syndrome produced by single doses of MPTP in the human or nonhuman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primate is not observed in rats given comparable MPTP doses (Kopin and Markey, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although endpoint and species selection appear to have a tremendous effect on the outcome 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an assessment, only a few studies have systematically investigated the effect on assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome of varying either the species or the endpoint within a species (McMillan, 1987; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hattis and Shapiro, 1990; Gaylor and Slikker, 1992).

5.2.3. Exposure Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This step of the risk assessment process determines the source, route, dose, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duration of human exposure to an agent. The results of the dose-response assessment are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined with an estimate of human exposure to obtain a quantitative estimate of risk. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either the effect of or the exposure to an agent approaches zero, the risk of neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches zero. It should be recognized that exposures to multiple agents may produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
synergistic or additive effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exposure can occur via many routes, including ingestion, inhalation, or contact with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skin. Sources of exposure may include soil, food, air, water, or intended vehicle (e.g., drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formulation). The degree of exposure may be strongly influenced by a number of factors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for example, the occupation of the individual involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The duration of exposure (i.e., acute or chronic) and interval of exposure (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
episodic or continuous) are variables of exposure that are common to all types of risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments, including carcinogenicity (OSTP, 1985). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not routinely used, biological markers or biomarkers of exposure could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
theoretically improve the exposure assessment process and, thereby, improve the overall risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of neurotoxicants. Exposure biomarkers may include either the quantitation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exogenous agents or the complex of endogenous substances and exogenous agents within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system (Committee on Biological Markers, 1987). A limited number of examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biomarkers of exposure have been reviewed by Slikker (1991) and include blood or dentine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead concentrations (Needleman, 1987), cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of dopamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolites following MPTP administration (Kopin and Markey, 1988), cerebrospinal fluid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of a serotonin metabolite following MDMA exposure (Ricaurte et al., 1986), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and serum esterase concentrations following organophosphate exposure (Levine et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986). The use of muscarinic receptor binding in peripheral plasma lymphocytes has also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been described as a potential biomarker of exposure for the organophosphates (Costa et al., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990). These examples suggest that biomarkers of exposure are available for some agents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but more effort will be required to demonstrate that these biomarkers can routinely be used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to improve the exposure assessment process.

5.2.4. Risk Characterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The final step of the risk assessment process combines the hazard identification, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose-response assessment, and the exposure assessment to produce the characterization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk. As previously stated, the current practice is to divide the NOAEL by the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety factor to obtain the RfD. The magnitudes of the safety factors used to determine RfDs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
[interspecies extrapolation (10), intraspecies extrapolation (10), and acute vs. chronic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure (10) = 1000] are based more on conservative estimates than on actual data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Sheehan et al., 1989; McMillan, 1987) and have been questioned for empirical reasons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Gaylor and Slikker, 1990). Uncertainty factors may be decreased as more data become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available. Modifying factors are also employed under certain circumstances to account for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the completeness of data sets. Along with this RfD numerical value, any uncertainties and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions inherent in the risk assessment should also be stated (OTA, 1990). Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RfD provides a single numerical value, it does not provide information concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty of this number nor does the RfD approach attempt to estimate the potential risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a function of dose or consider the potential risk at the NOAEL. The risk at the NOAEL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally is greater than zero and has been estimated to be as high as about 5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Crump, 1984; Gaylor, 1989). Concern has been expressed that the application of the RfD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach to all neurotoxicants is unlikely to be biologically defensible in light of mechanistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data (NRC, 1992). Several other quantitative risk assessment procedures have recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emerged as alternatives to the RfD approach (Kimmel and Gaylor, 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantitative risk assessment may be defined as a data-based process that uses dose-response information and measurements
of human exposure to arrive at estimates of risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assumptions are required to extrapolate results from high to low doses, to extrapolate from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
animal results to humans, and to extrapolate across different routes and durations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a step toward quantitative risk assessment, Crump (1984) suggested the use of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benchmark dose defined as ``a statistical lower confidence limit corresponding to a small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase in effect over the background level.'' The benchmark dose is determined with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mathematical model and is less affected by the particular shape of the dose-response curve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the benchmark approach avoids several problems inherent in the RfD approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., lack of precision in defining the LOAEL; Kimmel, 1990), the same final step of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dividing by arbitrary safety factors is obligatory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another approach to quantitative risk assessment is the statistical or curve-fitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. If quantal information concerning the proportion of response at a given dose is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available but mechanistic information is lacking, statistical models can be used to fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population data (Wyzga, 1990). This approach has been used to fit various models to data of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead toxicity. The data were sufficient to allow discrimination of several models in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goodness of fit; the nerve-conduction velocity data from children exposed to environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead as a function of blood lead concentration fit a ``hockey-stick'' type dose-response curve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than a logistic or quadratic model (Schwartz et al., 1988). These statistical approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not only provide a method to extrapolate data to lower exposure conditions but also can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide circumstantial evidence to support a proposed mechanism of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of quantitative risk assessment approaches depends, in part, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of information on the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics of the agent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question. In the development of a biologically based, dose-response model for MDMA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity, Slikker and Gaylor (1990) considered several factors, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacokinetics of the parent chemical, the target tissue concentrations of the parent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical or its bioactivated proximate toxicant, the uptake kinetics of the parent chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolite into the target cell and membrane interactions, and the interaction of the chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or metabolite with presumed receptor site(s). Because these theoretical factors contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturable step due to limited amounts of required enzyme, reuptake, or receptor site(s), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonlinear, saturable dose-response curve was predicted. In this case of neurochemical effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MDMA in the rodent, saturation mechanisms were hypothesized and indeed saturation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
curves provided relatively good fits to the experimental results. The conclusion was that use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dose-response models based on plausible biological mechanisms provide more validity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prediction than purely empirical models. Concomitant with attempts to develop quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment procedures, it is imperative that regulatory policy or risk management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures also be developed to use appropriately the type of data generated by quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment. However, until alternative risk assessment procedures have been validated, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the available RfD approach with its limitations will most likely continue to be used.

5.3. Generic Assumptions and Uncertainty Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The purpose of risk assessment is to determine the risk associated with human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to a hazard. The quality of the data from toxicological studies differs. In the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of therapeutic products where human effects information is available, risk assessments rely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily on the result of controlled clinical trials. Even when clinical trial data are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available, however, conducting a risk assessment is complicated by many uncertainties. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the face of these uncertainties, conservative assumptions are usually made at several steps in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk assessment process. For example, unless adequate clinical data are available, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most sensitive experimental species is frequently used. While conservative assumptions may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lead to a risk assessment that adequately protects the human population, this may result in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased financial burden on the public (e.g., manufacturing costs or loss of jobs); even then 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is impossible to be certain that the total population will be protected. Conversely, errors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leading to allowable exposure levels that are too high reduce the safety margin for human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and increase health care costs. Thus, there are compelling public health and economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons to obtain more precise risk assessments; all assumptions cannot be completely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated, but the degree of uncertainty associated with certain specific assumptions can at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least be reduced (Sheehan et al., 1989).

Risk assessment for neurotoxicity shares many common features with other noncancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicities such as developmental toxicity and immunotoxicity. As such, there are several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generic assumptions that apply to all traditional, noncancer endpoint risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures (Table 5&hyph;1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One approach to reducing some of the uncertainties is to critically define and examine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the assumptions made in the risk assessment process. Several of the more generic of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions are listed in Table 5&hyph;1. Despite their diversity, these assumptions share the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attribute of being partially replaceable by factual information. If, for example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption of 100 percent absorption of a toxicant from a contaminated food source is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced by data demonstrating that 90 percent of the toxicant is not biologically available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under human exposure conditions, then a revised risk assessment could allow a 10-fold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater exposure from that source; i.e., the former risk assessment was too conservative by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor of 10. As another example, many risk assessments employ data from two species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If experimental animals and humans absorb or metabolize the same fraction of a dose, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potency estimate would not change when extrapolating from animals to humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is necessary to have information on both human and animal rates before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in potency estimates are made. If a toxicant acts via a reactive intermediate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans produce 10-fold more of the intermediate than either of the test species under similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions, then allowable human exposure should be decreased 10-fold (i.e., the allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure levels are 10-fold too high) or an increased danger to human health exists. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings could then replace the ``most sensitive species'' principle with facts concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant human exposure and susceptibility. In these examples, the identification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumption helps define research needs or knowledge gaps (Sheehan et al., 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the knowledge gaps are many and complex, but some can be filled with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical solutions. The combination of ample dose-response data and a quantitative risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment process can eliminate assumptions 1 (existence of a threshold) and 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(reasonableness of safety factors) of the six generic assumptions (Table 5&hyph;1). The uncertainty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of assumption 4 (exposure comparisons) could be at least reduced with the proper application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of appropriate pharmacokinetic data. Likewise, the uncertainty of generic assumption 3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(variability of heterogeneous populations) can theoretically be reduced with the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of effect, to more accurately define the relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between exposure and biological effect in a large population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many assumptions remain, however, and uncertainty reduction by filling knowledge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gaps will ultimately require greater understanding of biological mechanisms underlying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxicity. A single risk assessment model may not be adequate for all conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure, for all endpoints, or for all agents. Risk assessment models of the future may well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include biomarkers of both effect and exposure as well as biologically based mechanistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations derived from both epidemiologic and experimental test system data.

6. General Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is now generally accepted that some chemicals, including industrial agents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pesticides, therapeutic agents, drugs of abuse, food-related chemicals, and cosmetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingredients, can have adverse effects on the structure and function of the nervous system. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has recently been proposed that exposure to neurotoxicants might also be associated with Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's
disease. Several Federal agencies have initiated research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs in neurotoxicology, developed neurotoxicology testing guidelines, and used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic endpoints to regulate chemicals in the environment and workplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scientific basis for identifying and characterizing chemical-induced neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has advanced rapidly during the last several years. The manifestation of neurotoxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depends on the relationship between exposure (applied dose) and the dose at the site of toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action (delivered or target dose) and response. Chemical-induced changes in the structure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function of the nervous system at the cellular or molecular level can be observed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alterations in sensory, motor, or cognitive function at the level of the whole organism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several important features about the nervous system make it particularly vulnerable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical insult, including differential susceptibilities at different stages of maturation, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of blood brain and nerve barriers that may be the target of toxic action, high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metabolic rate, and limited regenerative capability following damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods devised to detect and quantify agent-induced changes in nervous system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function in humans include clinical evaluations and neurotoxicity testing methods such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, imaging, and self-reporting procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Experimental approaches used in human neurotoxicology include epidemiological studies and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a limited extent, human laboratory exposure studies. There are several important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unresolved issues in human neurotoxicology, including the development of commonly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted risk assessment criteria and animal-to-human extrapolation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is generally assumed that if physical or chemical-induced neurotoxicity is observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in animal models, then neurotoxicity will be produced in humans. Considerable research has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been performed to demonstrate the validity of many animal models in an experimental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
context and to show predictive validity. Methods in animal neurotoxicology are frequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in a tier-testing framework with simpler, more cost-effective tests to screen or identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurotoxic potential. In hazard identification, the presence of neurotoxicity at the first tier is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to make decisions about subsequent development of a chemical or about the need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct additional experiments to define the level at which neurotoxicity will be observed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of methods have been devised for studies in animal neurotoxicology, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical techniques. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known that the neuroendocrine system may be affected adversely by neurotoxicants and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are populations that are differentially vulnerable to neurotoxic agents. Considerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research is in progress to employ structure-activity relationships to predict neurotoxicity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
newly developed in vitro procedures are being used to augment or complement currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing in vivo approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Principles of risk assessment for neurotoxicity are evolving rapidly. At the present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, neurotoxicity risk assessment is generally limited to qualitative hazard identification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neurotoxicological risk assessments have been generally based on a no observed adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect level and uncertainty factors. As with other noncancer endpoints, there is a need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider more information about the shape of the dose-response curve and mechanisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect in quantitative neurotoxicology risk assessment. Research is needed to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose-response models that incorporate biologic information and mechanistic hypotheses into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative extrapolation of dose-response relationships across species and from high to low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose exposures.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Maritime Administration (MARAD) announces establishment of the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement (VISA),
pursuant to section 708 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158). This is a new voluntary
agreement and is issued in accordance with the provisions of 44 CFR part 332. The purpose of VISA is to make intermodal
shipping services/systems, including ships, ships' space, intermodal equipment and related management services,
available to the Department of Defense as required to support the emergency deployment and sustainment of U.S. military
forces through cooperation among the maritime industry, the Department of Transportation and the Department of
Defense. Through advance arrangements in joint planning it is intended that the participants will provide capacity
to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements in dry cargo or intermodal equipment emergencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the authority contained in section 708 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158) (Section 708), the Administrator, after consultation
with representatives of ocean carriers providing intermodal shipping services/systems and with representatives
of companies which lease containers, chassis and other intermodal equipment, has developed this standby agreement
for voluntary contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems needed to meet national defense requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USTRANSCOM procures commercial shipping capacity to meet normal peacetime requirements for ships and intermodal
shipping services/systems through arrangements with common carriers (including services contracts), with contract
carriers and by charter. DOD, through USTRANSCOM, maintains and operates a fleet of ships owned by or under charter
to the Federal government, in sufficient numbers to meet those logistic needs of the military services which cannot
be met by commercial service. Ships of the RRF may be selectively activated for peacetime military tests and exercises,
and to satisfy military surge operational requirements which cannot be met by commercial shipping in time of war,
national emergency, or military contingency. Foreign-flag shipping may be used if no U.S.-flag ships can meet the
operational requirement. Through advance arrangements in joint planning described in IX. of this Agreement, it
is intended that Participants will provide capacity to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements
in dry cargo and intermodal equipment emergencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In time of war or national emergency, ships may be requisitioned under authority of section 902 of the Merchant Marine
Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1242) (Section 902). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some military contingency operations, more shipping capacity and related services may be required than are available
under peacetime arrangements, but general mobilization of shipping by requisition may not be appropriate. This
Agreement provides for the voluntary contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems in such a way as to distribute
the burden of such contributions in proportion to the capacity owned and controlled by each Participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Agreement will provide DOD with access to privately-owned intermodal shipping services/systems, will provide
door-to-door intermodal capacity, will create a pool of vessels, vessel capacity and intermodal equipment needed
in support of national defense activities and will provide Participants a defense to civil and criminal action for
violation of antitrust laws in carrying out this Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Agreement establishes the terms, conditions and general procedures under which each Participant agrees voluntarily
to make intermodal shipping services/systems available at the request of the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Agreement is designed to create close working relationships among the Administrator, USTRANSCOM and Participants
through which military needs and the needs of the civil economy can be met by cooperative action. Participants are
allowed maximum flexibility to adjust commercial operations by cooperation, rationalization of services and pooling
of vessels, vessel capacity and intermodal equipment,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 such measures are approved, in advance, by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The shipping capacity made available voluntarily under this Agreement may be supplemented by ships requisitioned,
under Section 902, from non-Participants in this Agreement and from Participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The containers and chassis made available voluntarily under this Agreement may be supplemented by services and equipment
accessed by the Administrator through the provisions of 46 CFR Part 340. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SecDef will be asked to concur in this Agreement at the appropriate stage. SecDef will be asked to approve this Agreement
as a sealift readiness program for the purpose of section 909 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C.
1248) (Section 909). Withdrawal from or termination of participation in this Agreement does not excuse a Participant
from Section 909 or any other provision of law if said withdrawn or terminated Participant is otherwise subject thereto.

Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Agreement establishes procedures for the contribution of intermodal shipping services/systems to satisfy
DOD needs. This Agreement will change from standby to active status upon a joint determination by the Secretary and
SecDef that a dry cargo shipping capacity emergency or an intermodal equipment emergency affecting the national
defense exists; that the defense requirement cannot be met by voluntary arrangements other than this Agreement;
and that the requirement can be met more efficiently by activating this Agreement than by requisitioning ships under
Section 902. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Agreement includes all intermodal shipping services/systems and all intermodal ship types, including container,
partial container, container/bulk, container/roll-on/roll-off, roll-on/roll-off and barge carrier (LASH,
SeaBee, etc.). Breakbulk ships may be enrolled in this Agreement at the discretion of the Administrator. When consideration
is being given to diverting intermodal shipping services/systems from commercial to defense use, an ocean carrier's
entire contribution will be considered. The object of this Agreement is to promote and facilitate the use of entire
intermodal transportation systems and to maximize DOD's use of commercial transportation resources while at the
same time attempting to minimize disruption to commercial operations. The Agreement does, however, provide for
the utilization of components of such systems (e.g., particular ship types) as necessary. Through advanced arrangements
developed during peacetime joint planning described in section IX of this Agreement, it is intended that Participants
will provide capability to support a significant portion of surge and sustainment requirements in dry cargo intermodal
equipment emergencies.

Section 708 of the Defense Production Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2158); Executive Order 12919, 59 FR 29525, June
7, 1994; Executive Order 12148, 3 CFR 1979 Comp., p. 412, as amended; 44 CFR Part 332; DOT Order 1900.8; 46 CFR Part 340.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 501 of Executive Order 12919 delegated the authority of the President under Section 708 to the Secretary,
among others. By DOT Order 1900.8, the Secretary delegated to the Administrator the authority under which this Agreement
is sponsored.

Need for this Agreement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_1. The Administrator has found, in accordance with Section 708(c)(1), that conditions exist which may pose a direct
threat to the national defense of the United States or its preparedness programs and, under the provisions of Section
708, has certified to the Attorney General that a standby voluntary agreement for utilization of intermodal shipping
services/systems is necessary for the national defense. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The quantity of military dry cargo (unit equipment, sustaining supplies and ammunition) to be moved for support
of a military contingency, national emergency, or war in a foreign area could exceed the shipping capacity normally
available for charter or use from the commercial sector. It is desirable to avoid the disruptive effects of ship requisition
and of intermodal equipment allocation so long as military requirements can be met by voluntary cooperation between
the maritime industry and the Federal government. The Attorney General, in consultation with the Chairman, has issued
a finding that dry cargo capacity to meet national defense requirements cannot be provided by the industry through
a voluntary agreement having less anti-competitive effects or without a voluntary agreement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
History of this Agreement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The concept of this Agreement originated in discussions between MARAD and DOD officials on arrangements to promote
timely availability of ships, equipment and management services needed to operate them. Most U.S.-flag shipping
companies operate ships as part of an integrated land/ocean transportation system. In times of emergency, DOD needs
not only vessels and intermodal equipment, but also the management expertise to operate such assets as transportation
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between vessel owners or operators
and the Secretary. This Agreement will constitute an Emergency Preparedness Program within the meaning of the amended
Title VI of the Act proposed in H.R. 4003. This Agreement will constitute a sealift readiness program when approved
by the SecDef and will meet all the conditions set forth under Section 909. An ocean carrier which is a Participant in
this Agreement is eligible for award of a Shipping Agreement or a Container Agreement from MSC without enrollment
in any other program. An ocean carrier eligible to participate in this Agreement but which elects not to do so is subject
to enrollment in the MSC Sealift Readiness Program (SRP) if it (1) receives operating-differential subsidy or construction-differential
subsidy or (2) wishes to carry DOD cargo. A carrier, while a Participant in this Agreement, will be subject only to the
provisions of this Agreement and not to the provisions of the SRP.

Agreement by Participant
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_1. Each Participant agrees to contribute intermodal shipping services/systems in accordance with this Agreement
and any Plan of Action applicable to the Participant and at such times and in such amounts as the Administrator shall
determine to be necessary to meet essential needs of DOD for transportation of military supplies and equipment during
the period this Agreement is activated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Participant agrees to provide all necessary elements to operate the intermodal transportation services/systems
it contributes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Each participant agrees to provide, on request, management services needed to operate the contributed intermodal
transportation services/systems; including inland container and trailer and other services, for the movement
to and from ports of equipment which is owned, operated, or controlled by a Participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Whenever possible, the Participant which owns, operates, or controls a ship or ship capacity contributed will
provide the intermodal equipment and management services needed to utilize the ship at full efficiency. However,
upon the recommendation of the Committee and at the Administrator's discretion, the ships and intermodal equipment
of a Participant may be placed under the operational management and control of another Participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pooling Resources
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Each Participant agrees to make intermodal shipping services/systems and intermodal equipment available to other
Participants when requested by the Administrator, on the advice of the Committee. Such requests will be made in order
to meet the defense requirement, to ensure that overall contributions are made on a proportionate basis, and to assure
that no Participant is unduly hampered in meeting the needs of the civil economy consistent with priorities established
by the President. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants may agree to cooperate, to rationalize services and to pool intermodal assets in order to meet the defense
requirement, equalize the burden of the contribution and insure continued support to the civil economy; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 however, that such activities involving Participants in the normal course of business when this Agreement has not

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equitable Contribution of Shipping Capacity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_1. Each Participant agrees to contribute ships and ship's space under this Agreement in accordance with VIII.B.1.
and 2. below. The contribution should be in the proportion of its ``controlled tonnage'' in each shipping capacity
category to the total ``controlled tonnage'' of all Participants in each such category. Because exact proportions
may not be feasible, and because unique requirements for a particular category of ships or capacity may arise, each
Participant agrees that variations are permissible at the discretion of the Administrator. Any Participant may
offer to increase its contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``Controlled tonnage'' consists of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Ships which are owned or chartered in by a Participant and documented under United States law; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PLUS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
non-U.S.-documented feeder ships, in which a Participant or any of its subsidiaries or controlled affiliates has
a controlling interest and which are operated as an extension of U.S.-flag line haul service; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PLUS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
any other non-U.S.-flag ships which a Participant may offer to designate as ``controlled tonnage'' and to which the
Administrator agrees; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
LESS 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ships owned or controlled by a Participant which are chartered, leased, or contracted out to others for remaining
periods of at least six months from the effective date of activation of this Agreement and for which there is no termination
clause for war, national emergency, or military contingency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The laws of the country of documentation may require the approval of that government before ships on its register
can be covered by this Agreement. The Participant agrees to make a good faith effort to obtain the required approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The categories of ships are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ships. RO/RO ships which do not have installed ramps should be supplied with portable
ramps, to the extent practicable, by the Participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Combination container-RO/RO ships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Barge carriers (LASH, SeaBee, etc.) The appropriate number of lighters should be supplied to operate the vessel
at full efficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Containerships, both self-sustaining and non-self-sustaining. Three containers should be provided per container
space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Partial containerships and container bulk. Three containers should be provided per container space. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Breakbulk ships. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The contribution of each Participant shall be calculated by the Administrator as soon as possible after this Agreement
is activated. The following standards will be used to determine proportionate contributions of ``controlled tonnage'':

6. A ship on charter to a Participant shall not be subject to contribution under this Agreement in the case where the
period of contribution would be longer than the remaining term of the Participant's charter or in a case where the contribution
would otherwise breach the terms of the charter party, but such tonnage shall be included in the calculation of the
Participant's controlled tonnage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The ``controlled tonnage'' of each Participant shall be divided into two categories: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level I
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Vessels of the Participant which are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Subject to Title VI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App. U.S.C. 1171 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) It is anticipated that Title VI will be amended in accordance with H.R. 4003 to provide for operating agreements between
vessel owners or operators and the Secretary. Vessels covered by an operating agreement are in Level I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Otherwise required by law to be made available to meet national defense requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Level II
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_All other vessels of the Participant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Level I vessels shall be provided immediately in response to the call of the Administrator and instructions of the
Administrator are to be observed with the utmost dispatch. Level I vessels will be called into service before Level
II vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Level II vessels shall be provided according to the schedule set forth in the call of the Administrator. Level II vessels
will be called into service if and when Level I vessels actually provided are not sufficient to meet the emergency.
A Participant may offer Level II vessels for service as Level I vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Other than the specific use of ships described in VI.C.2.b. (foreign-flag feeder vessels), it is expected that
vessels covered by an operating agreement will be utilized to the maximum extent possible for line haul service to
meet DOD requirements. When a specific ship covered by an operating agreement is removed from regular service to meet
DOD requirements, a foreign-flag ship may be employed to replace the ship taken from regular service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The Administrator retains the right under law to requisition ships of Participants. A Participant's ships which
are directly requisitioned by the United States or which are under other U.S. Government voluntary arrangements
shall be credited against the Participant's proportionate contribution under this Agreement. Ships on charter
to DOD when this Agreement is activated shall not be so credited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Equitable Contribution of Intermodal Equipment_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. ``Controlled intermodal equipment'' shall mean such equipment as is needed in the operation of a Participant's
intermodal shipping system and which a Participant owns or leases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. During the standby period, the Administrator shall determine the inventory of controlled intermodal equipment
as of a specific date each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. When an ocean carrier Participant contributes containerships or partial containerships, or capacity, it will
provide containers in accordance with VI.C.4. above and chassis as specified in a Plan of Action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Each Participant agrees to contribute intermodal equipment as provided in a Plan of Action, which may require contribution
in the proportion of its inventory of each type of equipment to the total inventory of that type held by all Participants;
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, that, at the discretion of the Administrator, on the advice of the Committee, when a Participant contributes specialized
equipment which is not available from all Participants, its proportionate share of common types of equipment may
be adjusted so that its overall contribution is in approximately the same proportion to its total available inventory
as are the overall contributions of other Participants to their available inventories.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Enrollment of Ships and Equipment_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The Administrator will maintain a record of ships and equipment enrolled under this Agreement according to a Plan
of Action. A schedule of ships and equipment which are owned and which are controlled by an applicant and which the applicant
proposes for enrollment will be attached to the form referenced in VIII. below. Ships and equipment will be enrolled
on the date this Agreement becomes effective for the Participant. Participants will notify the Administrator of
all changes to the schedule semi-annually on June 30 and December 31. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Administrator will make the enrollment data available to USTRANSCOM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Administrator shall, in consultation with Participants and with the concurrence of USTRANSCOM, promulgate
a methodology for determining rates of compensation under this Agreement. The methodology will be developed as a
separate Plan of Action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Employing the forms, including terms and conditions, found in the Plan of Action developed under this Agreement,
and the compensation determined in accordance with the rate methodology (VI.F.1 and implementing Plan of Action),
the Administrator or his designee, or USTRANSCOM or its designee, shall execute charters, leases and other contractual
arrangements which implement this Agreement upon its activation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

risk insurance, subject to the provisions of Section 1205 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (46 App.U.S.C.
1285(a)) upon activation of this Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VIII. Activation of This Agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. Determination of Necessity_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Agreement shall be activated upon a joint determination by the Secretary and SecDef that a dry cargo shipping
capacity emergency or an intermodal equipment emergency affecting the national defense exists, and that the defense
requirements cannot be met more effectively and timely without activation of this Agreement. A dry cargo shipping
capacity emergency and an intermodal equipment emergency will be deemed to exist when dry cargo shipping capacity
and intermodal equipment required to support operations of U.S. Forces outside the continental United States cannot
be supplied through the commercial market or other voluntary arrangements. The Administrator shall notify the Attorney
General and the Chairman when such a determination is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
