SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is adopting a final rule amending the anti-tying provision of Regulation Y to permit a bank or a bank holding
company to offer a discount on a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service (a ``traditional bank product''), or on
securities brokerage services, on condition that the customer obtain a traditional bank product from an affiliate.
The Board believes that this will increase the efficiency with which organizations can deliver banking services.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates. A prohibited
tie occurs if a bank: (1) varies the consideration for a product or service (the ``tying product'') on the condition
that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank or from any of its
affiliates; or (2) as a condition for providing a customer a product or service, requires the customer to purchase
another product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates. In 1971, the Board applied these tying restrictions
to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries as if they were banks. 12 CFR 225.4(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 contains an exception (the ``traditional bank product exception'') permitting a bank to tie a product
to a traditional bank product offered by that bank, but not by any affiliated bank or nonbank.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Thus, for example, the statutory exception permits a bank to offer a discount on a loan on the condition that a customer
maintain a deposit account at that bank; however, the bank may not offer a discount on a loan on the condition that a customer
maintain a deposit account at an affiliated bank.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, under the Board's extension of section 106 to nonbanks in Regulation Y, a nonbank may tie a product to a traditional
bank product offered by itself, but not by an affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 11, 1994, the Board requested public comment on two proposed exceptions to section 106. 59 FR 12,202 (March
16, 1994). The first exception would extend the statutory traditional bank product exception described above to
permit a bank or bank holding company to offer a discount on a traditional bank product to a customer who obtains another
traditional bank product from an affiliate. The second proposed exception would permit a bank or bank holding company
to offer a discount on securities brokerage services to a customer who obtains a traditional bank product from an affiliate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 106 authorizes the Board to permit, by regulation or order, exceptions from its anti-tying provisions where
the Board determines that an exception will not be contrary to the purposes of the section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received 68 comments on its proposal. These commenters included 31 bank holding companies, 17 banks, two
law firms, five Reserve Banks and seven trade associations. Overall, the comments supported both parts of the proposed
rule. One commenter generally opposed the proposed amendments because it believed that exceptions to section 106
should be provided on a case-by-case basis and not as a general matter through rulemaking, and that by acting on individual
requests, the Board would be able to prevent potential anticompetitive effects, especially in small towns. The Board
has concluded, however, that the benefits and costs of the proposal may be assessed in the aggregate and that rulemaking
is appropriate.

Traditional Bank Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is adopting substantially as proposed the extension of the traditional bank product exception in section
106 to cover discount arrangements involving an affiliate. In particular, the final rule permits a bank or nonbank
to vary the consideration charged for a traditional bank product on the condition that a customer obtain another traditional
bank product from an affiliate, provided that each product in the arrangement is separately available for purchase
by the customer. The Board believes that the exception is fully consistent with the purposes of section 106, will increase
the efficiency with which banking organizations can deliver banking services, and will allow those organizations
to provide their customers discounts on packages of banking products that include products offered by affiliates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted, section 106 contains an exception permitting a bank to tie a product to a traditional bank product offered
by that same bank. The Senate Report accompanying section 106 states that the traditional bank product exception
was intended to preserve a customer's ability to negotiate the price of multiple banking services with the bank on
the basis of the customer's entire relationship with the bank. S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 16&hyph;17 (1970).
The Board believes that it is consistent with this stated statutory purpose for a bank or bank holding company to offer
a discount on packages of traditional bank products when one of the component products in the package is offered by
an affiliate. Since 1970 and 1971, there has been a substantial increase in the number of affiliates in bank holding
company organizations and the extent of specialization of these affiliates, which has led to customers obtaining
traditional bank products from multiple affiliates, both bank and nonbank. Adoption of the proposed rule will be
consistent with the purposes of section 106 by allowing a customer to negotiate the price of multiple traditional
banking services on the basis of the customer's entire relationship with a bank holding company organization, as
opposed to just a single bank within such an organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By allowing bank holding companies to package traditional bank products offered by multiple subsidiaries, the exception
also will increase the efficiency with which bank holding companies can deliver those products. Several commenters
explained that the existing rule had created a disincentive for bank holding companies to consolidate a given traditional
bank product in one affiliate (and thereby lose the exemption for that activity), as opposed to offering the product
through all its subsidiary banks (retaining the exemption at each bank but forfeiting efficiency gains). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adoption of the proposed exception to section 106 will not only permit bank holding companies to offer products more
efficiently but also will allow their customers to benefit. Customers will be able to realize cost savings when they
obtain traditional bank products from two or more subsidiaries of a bank holding company instead of just one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the inter-affiliate traditional bank product exception will allow bank holding company affiliates to offer
customers a more favorable price on packages of banking products, thereby relieving bank holding companies of a competitive
disadvantage and benefitting their customers, the Board has concluded that the amendment is consistent with the
purposes of section 106 and should be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters requested an expansion of the proposed exception to include inter-affiliate arrangements in
which the tying product is a non-traditional bank product and the tied product is a traditional bank product. The Board
has decided not to extend the statutory traditional bank product exception to inter-affiliate tying involving non-traditional
bank products at this time. However, in a separate notice, the Board is proposing to amend the tying restrictions of
Regulation Y to permit any discount arrangement that involves only nonbank affiliates.

Discounts on Securities Brokerage Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In December 1993, the Board approved an exemption for a brokerage subsidiary of a bank to offer a discount on brokerage
services to its customers who maintain a minimum balance in an account at the bank or any affiliated bank.

 80 Federal Reserve Bulletin 166 (1994). The Board concluded that the requested exemption was consistent with the
legislative purpose of section 106 (to prevent banks from using their economic power to engage in anticompetitive
practices) and the legislative purpose of the Board's exemptive authority (to allow appropriate traditional banking
practices based on sound economic analysis). In its order, the Board found that the market for retail brokerage services
was national in scope and highly competitive, making it unlikely that any of these banks_or any other provider of brokerage
services_could exercise sufficient market power in brokerage services to impair competition in the market for traditional
banking services. As part of the order, the Board required that the two products in the arrangement be separately available
for purchase by the customer, noting that under antitrust precedent, concerns about tying are substantially reduced
when the buyer is free to take either product by itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is adopting substantially as proposed an amendment to Regulation Y making this exemption available to all
bank holding companies. This amendment will permit any bank or bank holding company to offer a discount on brokerage
services if a customer obtains a traditional bank product from any affiliate. The regulatory exception is conditioned
on the brokerage services and traditional bank products offered in the arrangement being separately available for
purchase by the customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters overwhelmingly favored the proposed amendment. Commenters stated that the regulatory exception would
promote fair competition with nonbank competitors and would result in cost savings and other benefits to customers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A securities industry association opposed the proposed exception because it believed that the exception would increase
customer confusion by reinforcing the false impression that brokerage services offered by banks are insured by the
federal government. However, the recent inter-agency statement on retail sales of non-deposit investment products
specifies steps that banks should take to prevent confusion, including informing customers in writing that the products
are not federally insured, are not deposits or other obligations of the institution and are not guaranteed by the institution,
and involve investment risks including possible loss of principal. In addition, the statement restricts where an
institution may offer non-deposit investment products. The Board believes that this statement satisfactorily
addresses any possibility of an increase in customer confusion about coverage of federal deposit insurance where
banks offer brokerage services as part of a package arrangement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that the Board clarify that ``brokerage services'' refers to ``securities brokerage
services'' and that securities brokerage services include related incidental services as authorized by Regulation
Y. These technical changes are consistent with the intent of the proposed rule, and will be included in the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters requested that the Board grant an exception permitting a bank or a bank holding company to vary the
consideration charged for a traditional bank product, such as a deposit service, based on a customer's purchase of
brokerage services_the converse of the proposed exception. The Board believes that this proposal should be evaluated
in the context of a specific exemption request. One such request has been published for comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters sought an interpretation that ties involving mutual funds were either wholly or partially exempt
from section 106, either because mutual funds are not bank holding company subsidiaries or because mutual fund products
constitute trust services and therefore qualify as traditional bank products. The Board intends to address this
issue separately.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters sought clarification on whether both proposed exceptions were limited to cases where the tying product
was offered by a bank, or also included cases where the tying product was offered by a bank holding company or its nonbanking
subsidiary. The concern arose because the proposed exceptions were phrased only in terms of banks. The Board notes
that the language of section 225.4(d)(1) of Regulation Y would automatically apply the proposed exceptions for banks
to bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries, as was intended by the proposed rulemaking. However,
the final rule has been amended to make this coverage explicit. Rather than referring to a ``bank'' offering a traditional
bank product or a discount on brokerage services, the rule refers to a ``bank holding company or bank or nonbank subsidiary
thereof.''

Reorganization of Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a non-substantive change, the Board has restructured the regulation to make it more easily understandable. The
regulation has been moved from the section on corporate practices, &sect;225.4, and established as its own section,
&sect;225.7. The application of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries is contained
in paragraph (a). Paragraph (b) contains exceptions to both section 106 and &sect;225.7(a), and paragraph (c) contains
limitations on each of those exceptions. Finally, a definition paragraph, &sect;225.7(d), has been added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the exception for credit card services previously contained in &sect;225.4(d)(2) has been removed
from the regulation, as all transactions previously excepted under that provision are now excepted under the traditional
bank product exception in &sect;225.7(b)(1). Also, the phrase ``(but no other products)'' has been deleted in places
where it was superfluous. These changes are not substantive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This document provides a statement of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policy concerning noise limits for
future civil supersonic airplanes (SST). The FAA is withdrawing a previously published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) that proposed to amend the regulations regarding type certification noise limits of these airplanes. This
document supplements the withdrawal of the proposed rule.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, the FAA proposed to amend the type certification noise standards and noise operating rules for future-generation
civil supersonic airplanes. After analyzing the comments received on the NPRM, the FAA determined that further investigation
and research is necessary before a final rule can be developed. The withdrawal of that NPRM its published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. Although the proposed rule is being withdrawn, the FAA has not changed its policy on noise issues involving the development
of future-generation civil supersonic airplanes.

Policy Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While it is premature at this time to issue a final rule establishing the specific noise standard for such supersonic
airplanes, it is important to reiterate the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) commitment to aviation's longstanding
efforts to achieve increasingly effective noise abatement at its source. Consequently, it is anticipated that any
future Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued by FAA would propose that any future SST airplane shall produce no greater
noise impact on a community than a subsonic airplane certified to Stage 3 noise limits. As such, the noise limits prescribed
in 14 CFR part 36, Stage 3 may be used as guidelines for the development of any future SST airplane. This is consistent
with the recommendation recently added to Chapter 4 of the International Civil Aviation Organization's Annex 16,
Volume I, that states that Chapter 3 noise levels applicable to subsonic airplanes may be used as guidelines for future
SST airplanes. Provisions for the noise certification of future SST airplanes will be developed giving consideration,
to the extent possible, to the unique operational flight characteristics of future SST designs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, in connection with the consolidation of the Office of Opinions and Review into the Office of the General Counsel,
the responsibility to advise the Commission, make certain procedural decisions, and take certain actions in connection
with Rule 2(e) proceedings was delegated to the Executive Assistant to the Chairman. The delegation was designed
to ensure required separation of functions in light of the fact that the General Counsel was then responsible for prosecuting
Rule 2(e) proceedings. In February 1993, the Task Force on Administrative Proceedings of the Securities and Exchange
Commission recommended that the authority to advise the Commission with respect to Rule 2(e) proceedings be delegated
to the Office of the General Counsel. Since then, responsibility for the prosecution of Rule 2(e) proceedings involving
professionals, other than attorneys, has been transferred to the Division of Enforcement. Transfer of the responsibility
to advise the Commission, make certain procedural decisions, and take certain actions in connection with Rule 2(e)
proceedings would permit the Commission to employ, with respect to those proceedings, the staff that reviews and
prepares opinions and orders in other proceedings decided by the Commission. The Commission has determined to adopt
the Task Force's recommendations and is not delegating the responsibility to advise the Commission, make certain
procedural decisions, and take certain actions in connection with Rule 2(e) proceedings to the General Counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The delegation provides that, in a case in which the involvement of the General Counsel is deemed inappropriate for
any reason, the Executive Assistant to the Chairman, or other staff outside the Office of the General Counsel, will
assume responsibility for the matter. In light of the fact that the General Counsel retains responsibility for prosecuting
Rule 2(e) proceedings against attorneys, the Commission intends that persons other than staff in the Office of the
General Counsel will provide advice concerning any such matters so long as the Office of the General Counsel prosecutes
such cases. Some minor clarifying changes in language, without substantive effect, are also being made.

The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A), that this revision

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 27, Merchant Marine Act of 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. App. 883), provides generally that no merchandise shall
be transported by water, or by land and water, between points in the United States except in vessels built in and documented
under the laws of the United States and owned by U.S. citizens. However, the sixth proviso of the Act, as amended, provides
that upon a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to information obtained and furnished by the Secretary
of State, that a foreign nation does not restrict the transportation of certain articles between its ports by vessels
of the United States, reciprocal privileges will be accorded to vessels of that nation, and the prohibition against
transportation of those articles between points in the U. S. will not apply to its vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Act, the Customs Service has listed in &sect;4.93(b)(1) of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR
4.93(b)(1)) those nations found to extend reciprocal privileges to vessels of the United States for the transportation
of empty cargo vans, empty lift vans, and empty shipping tanks. Those nations found to grant reciprocal privileges
to vessels of the United States for the transportation of equipment for use with cargo vans, lift vans, and shipping
tanks; empty barges specifically designed for carriage aboard a vessel; empty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instruments of international traffic; and certain stevedoring equipment and material, are listed in &sect;4.93(b)(2)
of the Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.93(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority to amend this section of the Customs Regulations has been delegated to the Chief, Regulations Branch.

Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 21, 1994, accompanied by a copy of a communication from the Embassy of Malta, the Department of State
advised that Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of the articles listed in the Act by vessels of the
United States between Maltese ports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the basis of information received from the Department of State and the Embassy of Malta, it has been determined that
Malta places no restrictions on the transportation of the articles specified in section 27 of the Merchant Marine
Act of 1920, as amended (46 U.S.C. App. 883), by vessels of the United States. Therefore, appropriate reciprocal privileges
are accorded to vessels of Maltese registry as of May 27, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this amendment merely implements a statutory requirement and involves a matter in which the public is not
particularly interested, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), notice and public procedure thereon are unnecessary.
Furthermore, for the same reasons, good cause exists for dispensing with a delayed effective date under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

 This document amends the Customs Regulations by adding Italy to the list of countries whose pleasure vessels may be
issued U.S. cruising licenses. Customs has been informed that yachts used and employed exclusively as pleasure vessels
belonging to any U.S. resident are allowed to arrive at and depart from Italian ports and cruise in the waters of Italy
without being subjected to formal entry and clearance procedures. Therefore, Customs is extending reciprocal entry
and clearance procedures to Italian-flag pleasure vessels.

Section 4.94(a), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.94(a)), provides that U.S. documented vessels with a recreational
endorsement, that are used exclusively for pleasure and not engaged in any trade and that do not violate the U.S. Customs

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or navigation laws, may proceed from port to port in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to foreign ports without entering and clearing, provided they have not visited a hovering vessel. However, when
returning from a foreign port or place, such pleasure vessels are required to report their arrival pursuant to &sect;4.2,
Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foreign-flag yachts entering the U.S. are generally required to comply with the laws applicable to foreign vessels
arriving at, departing from, and proceeding between ports of the U.S. See, for example, &sect;433, Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(19 U.S.C. 1433). However, &sect;4.94(b), Customs Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(19 CFR 4.94(b)), provides that pleasure vessels from certain countries found to exempt U.S. pleasure vessels from
certain formal Customs procedures may be issued cruising licenses that reciprocally exempt them from similar, U.S.
formal entry and clearance procedures (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
filing manifests, obtaining permits to proceed, and paying entry and clearance fees). Then, upon arrival at each
U.S. port of entry, the masters of such licensed vessels simply report the fact of arrival to the appropriate Customs
office. Also, yachts or pleasure vessels not carrying passengers or merchandise in trade are exempt from paying tonnage
tax and light money pursuant to &sect;4.21(b)(5), Customs Regulations (19 CFR 4.21(b)(5)). The list of such countries
that have been granted reciprocal customs privileges is set forth at &sect;4.94(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By diplomatic note dated January 20, 1994, the Embassy of Italy, in Washington, D.C., informed the Department of State
that Italy allows U.S. yachts and other pleasure boats to arrive at and depart from Italian ports and to cruise without
payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of import duties or taxes and free of import prohibitions and restrictions, subject to re-exportation and certain
other conditions. By letter dated March 7, 1994, the Department of State advised the Chief, Carrier Rulings Branch,
U.S. Customs Service, that the Italian treatment of U.S. pleasure vessels in Italian waters appeared to satisfy the
conditions for reciprocal customs privileges and recommended that Italy be added to the list of countries under the
provisions of 19 CFR 4.94(b). The Director, International Trade Compliance Division, is of the opinion that satisfactory
evidence has been furnished to grant the reciprocal privileges allowed under &sect;4.94(b), effective March 11,
1994, and requested that Italy be added to the list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of countries enumerated at &sect;4.94(b).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A SIP revision was submitted by the State of Alabama on November 13, 1992, to satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(3)(B)
of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) (November 15, 1990). The SIP revision was reviewed by EPA to determine
completeness shortly after its submittal, in accordance with the completeness criteria set out at 40 CFR part 51,
Appendix V (1991), as amended by 57 FR 42216 (August 26, 1991). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter dated
December 24, 1992, was sent to Mr. Richard Grusnick, Chief of the Air Division in the Alabama Department of Environmental
Management indicating the submittal was administratively complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are several key general and specific components of an acceptable emission statement program. Specifically,
the state must submit a revision to its SIP and the emission statement program must meet the minimum requirements for
reporting. In general, the program must include, at a minimum, provisions for applicability, definitions, compliance,
and specific source requirements detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. SIP Revision Submission. The State of Alabama submitted their emission statement regulation on November 13, 1992,
which meets the emission statement requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Program Elements. The State emission statement program must, at a minimum, include provisions covering applicability
of the regulations, a compliance schedule for sources covered by the regulations, and the specific reporting requirements
for sources. The emission statement submitted by the source should contain, at a minimum, a certification that the
information is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. These requirements can
be found in subpart D on page 2, of section 2, of chapter 11, in the Alabama SIP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Applicability. Section 182(a)(3)(B) requires that states with areas designated as nonattainment for ozone,
require emission statement data from sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the nonattainment areas. This requirement applies to all ozone nonattainment areas, regardless of the classification
(Marginal, Moderate, etc.). The states may waive, with EPA approval, the requirement for emission statements for
classes or categories of sources with less than 25 tons per year of actual plant-wide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or VOC emissions in nonattainment areas if the class or category is included in the base year and periodic inventories
and emissions are calculated using emission factors established by EPA (such as those found in EPA publication AP&hyph;42)
or other methods acceptable to EPA. The Alabama submittal waives the emission statement requirement for sources
with less than 25 tons per year combined of actual plant-wide NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and VOC emissions and has included calculations of these emissions in their 1990 Base Year Emissions Inventory.

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this action, EPA is approving the Emission Statement SIP revision submitted by the State of Alabama through the
ADEM. This action is being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial and EPA anticipates
no significant comments on them. The public should be advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994. However,
if adverse or critical comments are received by September 6, 1994, this action will be withdrawn and all public comments
received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on the proposed rule (please see the proposed rule published,
simultaneously, in the proposal section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by (60 days from date of publication). Filing a petition
for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes
of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not
postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce
its requirements. [See section 307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(2)]. This action has been classified as a Table
2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables.
On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and
Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request
continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing
in this action shall be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for
a revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the
impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the
rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses,
small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities. Moreover, due to the nature
of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute
federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning
SIPs on such grounds.

 The Environmental Protection Agency is announcing the limited approval of a request by the State of New York to revise
its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone related to the control of volatile organic compound emissions from
architectural coatings. EPA is also finding that the State has partially met a commitment made in its 1982 ozone and
carbon monoxide SIP for the New York City Metropolitan Area to regulate architectural coatings. This revision deleted
part 205 (1979 version) ``Photochemically Reactive Solvents and Organic Solvents from Certain Processes-New York
City Metropolitan Area'' and added part 205 ``Architectural Surface Coatings.'' This regulation will result in
additional reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds which will help to attain the national ambient
air quality standard for ozone.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40107) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed limited approval of a request by
the State of New York to revise its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone. This revision deleted part 205 (1979
version) ``Photochemically Reactive Solvents and Organic Solvents from Certain Processes-New York City Metropolitan
Area'' and added new part 205 ``Architectural Surface Coatings,'' effective September 15, 1988 to Title 6 of the New
York Code of Rules and Regulations. EPA also proposed finding that the State has partially met a commitment made in
its 1982 ozone and carbon monoxide SIP for the New York City Metropolitan Area (NYCMA) to regulate architectural coatings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New part 205 provides for the regulation of architectural surface coatings, sold, offered for sale, or used in the
NYCMA. Architectural surface coatings applied to stationary structures, buildings, houses, mobile homes, pavement
or curbs are regulated by part 205. These coatings are not applied in a factory or manufacturing operation. The regulation
requires any architectural coating manufactured after July 1, 1989 that is to be sold, offered for sale or used in the
NYCMA to meet the designated volatile organic compound (VOC) content limitations in part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paint manufacturers must include on the container the VOC content limitations, date of manufacture or date code,
along with any instructions concerning thinning. Compliance with part 205 can be determined visually by checking
the paint containers and by taking samples of the paint and calculating the volatile content of the coating and comparing
it with the limit in the regulation. In some instances it is necessary to measure certain coating parameters. The EPA
recommended test method for determining these parameters is EPA Reference Method 24 (40 CFR part 60 Appendix A). Part
205 inadvertently omitted this reference which New York uses in performing similar testing for other regulations.
Therefore, EPA cannot fully approve the regulation. However, because EPA believes that the regulation strengthens
the SIP by providing for additional reductions of VOCs, EPA is granting a limited approval to the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also finds that the State has partially fulfilled its commitment in the SIP to adopt an architectural coatings
control measure (contained in part 205). Adoption of a specific test procedure, as discussed above, is necessary
to completely fulfill this commitment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for EPA's limited approval is further explained in the proposed rulemaking on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40107).
In that proposed rulemaking, EPA asked for comments on its proposed action. EPA received one comment, from the Consumer
Policy Institute (CPI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPI raises three issues in its comments: the timeliness of New York's submission, the difference between the emission
reductions New York committed to and the emission reductions actually obtained, and whether New York is enforcing
the regulation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, CPI notes that New York has failed to meet the commitment made in its 1982 SIP in a timely manner, and questions
whether New York will further ``slip'' in meeting other SIP requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York's 1982 SIP committed to develop and adopt an architectural regulation by January, 1986. New York did not meet
this date for a variety of reasons. The Clean Air Act, as revised in 1977, provided limited remedies for a state which
failed to meet Act and SIP requirements, but these were sufficient to result in New York adopting part 205 on August
15, 1988. The amendments of 1990 substantially strengthen EPA's enforcement abilities by providing specific procedures,
time frames for SIP submittals and sanctions should a state fail to submit or implement their SIPs. The sanctions which
the Act mandates are: restrictions on new growth of industries which generate air pollutants and a loss of federal
highway funds. EPA believes these new strengthened procedures and sanctions will induce the states to fulfill their
obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, CPI notes that New York committed to obtaining 11,682 tons of reductions in VOCs in its 1982 SIP, yet New York
now estimates that part 205 will only result in emission reductions of 3,000 tons per year. CPI questions how New York
will meet this commitment for equivalent tonnage reductions in VOCs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This comment raises concerns regarding the level of controls that have been required and the ability of New York to
demonstrate attainment (i.e., rectify the shortfall). The Clean Air Act addresses both of these concerns. The Act
uses a fundamental concept that sources should apply reasonably available control technology (RACT), as defined
in control techniques guidelines (CTGs) or as determined by a state through a specific technical and economic review
of the industry. As EPA explained in its proposed action, New York's original emission reduction was based on 1975
data which New York believes overestimated the amount of solvent based coatings used in the NYCMA, and on which the
projected emission reductions were based. The present emission reduction estimate reflects current coating usage
and solvent content which EPA believes is more accurate. EPA also notes that New York has regulated all the high volume
coatings as well as most of the lower usage coatings that the original commitment intended. In addition, EPA has found
that New York's VOC limitations are consistent with regulations of the limited number of states that have also regulated
these coatings. Furthermore, section 183(e) of the Act requires EPA to regulate consumer products, which include
architectural coatings. EPA has a major rule development effort underway to develop a national architectural coatings
regulation that will provide more extensive and current data on coating content and usage. Once this data is available,
New York will be able to reevaluate its rule to determine if additional reductions are achievable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In terms of New York's ability to reach attainment, Congress, in recognizing that many states, including New York
were having problems solving their air pollution problems, set forth a procedure for states to follow in the Act as
amended in 1990. This procedure consists of requirements to develop accurate current emission inventories that
can be used in selecting control strategies, to adopt specific control measures, to develop reasonable further progress
plans, and to develop any additional control measures needed to attain the standard by the specified dates. These
requirements will address any shortfalls that remain from the previously approved SIP and insure that states, like
New York, attain the ozone standard in an expeditious manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, CPI raises its concern that, while New York State has adopted the regulation, it may not actually be enforcing
it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 205 contains labeling requirements with which manufacturers of architectural coatings must comply. This provides
a quick method of screening the coatings being sold. In addition, after the regulation became effective, New York
State performed random checks of retail stores to ensure that only compliant coatings were being sold. New York has
continued to take action to ensure that retailers and manufacturers are complying with part 205. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, by incorporating this regulation into New York's SIP, it becomes federally enforceable. Thus EPA has
the authority to take enforcement action should EPA determine there is any lack of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has reviewed New York's request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those
requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment. The revision incorporates
a control program consistent to the one committed to in the 1982 SIP and results in emission reductions. Therefore,
New York's submittal meets the requirements of section 193. Beyond that, the revision will not interfere with the
SIP's ability to meet the new Act's requirements, and thus it meets the test in section 110(i) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of a missing test method, EPA cannot grant full approval to this regulation under section 110(k)(3). Because
the submitted regulation is not composed of separable parts which meet all the applicable requirements of the Act,
EPA cannot grant partial approval for the rule under section 110(k)(3). However, EPA may grant limited approval of
the submittal under section 110(k)(3) in light of EPA's authority pursuant to section 301(a) to adopt regulations
necessary to further air quality by strengthening the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also finds that the State has partially fulfilled its commitment in the SIP to adopt an architectural coatings
control measure (contained in part 205). Adoption of the missing test procedure, as discussed above, is necessary
to fulfill this commitment in whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 183(e)(3) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA develop either national regulations or CTG for consumer and
commercial products, which may include architectural coatings. If EPA promulgates a federal regulation for architectural
coatings under this authority, then sources covered by New York's part 205 would also be required to comply with the
federal regulation. New York does retain the right to promulgate regulations that are more stringent than either
a federal regulation or a CTG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors, and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is approving a February 11, 1993, State submittal requesting
a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). The revision pertains to a site-specific
emission limit for an iron foundry operated by General Motors Corporation (GMC) and located adjacent to Interstate
74 at G Street in Vermilion County, Illinois. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment''
for carbon monoxide. In the proposed rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

On October 1, 1992, the Illinois Pollution Control Board (IPCB) adopted a Final Opinion and Order amending Title 35:
Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution Chapter I: Pollution Control Board (35 IAC) section 216.381
revising the allowable emission limit of gases containing CO from 200 ppm to 2,000 ppm for the GMC iron foundry in Vermilion
County, Illinois.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The GMC foundry manufactures iron castings for the automotive industry. The castings include brake drums, bearing
caps, differential carriers, water pumps and brake rotors. The foundry is located approximately 1.5 miles from downtown
Danville adjacent to Interstate 74 at G Street, in an area that is predominately agricultural, with some residential
sections. This is the only iron foundry in Vermilion County. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment''
of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO (Refer to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations &sect;81.314,
1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GMC foundry is presently using two cupolas, Number 2 and Number 3, in its foundry operation. A cupola is a vertical
shaft furnace which is fed or ``charged'' with layers of metallics, coke and limestone. Cupola melting is used by GMC
to melt scrap metal. Approximately 220,000 tons of scrap metal are remelted and made into castings each year. Typical
cupola exhaust gases contain 13 to 27 percent CO. This is the equivalent of 130,000 to 270,000 parts per million (ppm).
In a cupola, high CO levels and specific carbon dioxide ratios are important to the metallurgical properties of the
iron. These levels can be minimized by proper selection of fuels, charge material, and by major facility changes,
but cannot be eliminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1988, emission tests of the cupolas showed CO emissions from both cupolas were in excess of 200 ppm. CO was present
at a concentration of 8,317 ppm for Cupola Number 3 and at 4,563 ppm for Cupola Number 2. Subsequent tests showed CO concentrations
as high as 16,053 ppm for Cupola Number 3. As a result of these tests, GMC initiated an aggressive plan to modify the system
beyond the state-of-the art contemplated by the regulation. In November 1988, GMC filed a petition for a variance
in order to continue the operation of the foundry while it implemented corrective action to reduce the concentration
of CO in its emissions. Although modifications have significantly reduced emissions, compliance with the 200 ppm
limitation has not been achieved. However, emissions have dropped from a high concentration of approximately 18,000
ppm to below 2,000 ppm. A computer modeling study discussed below demonstrated that CO emissions at the rate of 2,000
ppm would not adversely affect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The purpose of this source specific
SIP revision request is to permanently amend GMC's allowable emission limit of gases containing CO from 200 ppm to
2,000 ppm for this iron foundry.

II. Analysis of State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As previously stated, the IPCB has adopted a site-specific regulation revising the allowable emission limit of CO
from GMC cupolas in Vermilion County from 200 ppm to 2,000 ppm. The new language reads as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->
The standard for CO for 35 IAC 216.381 shall not apply to the existing foundry located adjacent to Interstate 74 at G
street in Vermilion County, owned by GMC on the effective date of this regulation. The emission of carbon monoxide
from this foundry shall not exceed 2,000 ppm corrected to 50 percent excess air.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Title 35: Environmental Protection, Subtitle B: Air Pollution, Chapter I: Pollution Control Board of the Illinois
Administrative Code (35 IAC) Part 216_Carbon Monoxide Emissions, contains the regulations regarding this SIP revision
request. Section 216.101_Measurement Methods, contains measurement methods applicable to GMC's site-specific
SIP revision request. This section states that carbon monoxide concentrations in an effluent stream shall be measured
by the non-dispersive infrared method or by other methods approved by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA) according to the provisions of 35 IAC 201.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA had concerns about the test method and recordkeeping for this source. Specifically the test methods and
recordkeeping requirements relied on in this requested SIP revision were not sufficient to ensure compliance with
the limit and maintenance of the CO NAAQS. Further, because section 216.201 allows IEPA to modify the test methods
utilized and because case law indicates that such State discretionary actions modify the SIP without Federal comment
or approval USEPA would be required to disapprove this requested SIP revision since the possibility of modification
without Federal approval would impede attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. (See for example

Allsteel Inc.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(No. 87C4638 ND Illinois, August 30, 1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA would ordinarily propose to disapprove this site-specific regulation and recommend that the State modify
the regulations in the requested SIP revision to incorporate the appropriate test methods, recordkeeping and reporting
requirements and to remove the discretionary provisions or at least to limit their effectiveness until they were
approved as a SIP revision by USEPA. However, on December 17, 1992 (57 FR59928) Illinois' operating permit program
was approved by USEPA and incorporated into the SIP for the purpose of issuing Federally Enforceable State Operating
Permits (FESOP). As operating permits issued following the approved State requirements are federally enforceable,
Illinois addressed USEPA's concerns by including adequate test methods and recordkeeping requirements as discussed
in section 3 in a FESOP for the GMC iron foundry.

The USEPA reviewed the dispersion modeling analysis performed by Versar Incorporated for this SIP revision request
and has determined that the analysis is acceptable as a demonstration of attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS for
CO. This attainment and maintenance demonstration was performed in accordance with USEPA guidance.

III. Final Rulemaking Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The USEPA approves the February 11, 1993, submittal as a revision to the Illinois CO SIP for the GMC iron foundry in Vermilion
County amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35 IAC section 216.381 because the deficiencies identified were corrected in a FESOP issued to the Source. Vermilion
County is and has always been designated as attainment for CO and ozone and the emission limit set forth in the SIP revision
was shown through the modeling analysis not to cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS for CO. Because the State
included the following conditions in a FESOP, the SIP revision is now federally enforceable upon the effective date
of this action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Specific test method to be used;

2. Identification as to whether a continuous or integrated sample is to be used in the test method;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A compliance test that contains averaging times; and

4. The appropriate reporting and recordkeeping requirements to insure compliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because USEPA considers this action noncontroversial and routine, we are approving it without prior proposal. This
action will become effective on October 3, 1994. However, if the USEPA receives adverse comments by September 6, 1994,
then the USEPA will publish a notice that withdraws the action, and will address the comments received in response
to this final rule in the final rule on the requested SIP revision which has been proposed for approval in the proposed
rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The comment period will not be extended or reopened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from
the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent
waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it
rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis
assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, USEPA may
certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities
include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations
of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply
approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose
any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base
its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 4, 1994, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 15689) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to approve a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted
by the State of New Jersey for its Emission Statement Program. The SIP revision was submitted to satisfy Section 182(a)
of the Clean Air Act which requires stationary sources to report on an annual basis their emissions of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for EPA's proposed approval was explained in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and will not be restated
here since EPA's final action does not differ from the proposed action. EPA inadvertently omitted reference in the
Proposed Rulemaking to Subchapter 1, ``General Provisions''; Subchapter 8, ``Permits and Certificates, Hearings,
and Confidentiality''; and Subchapter 16, ``Control and Prohibition of Air Pollution by Volatile Organic Compounds,''
but will take action on the changes made to these subchapters in a subsequent rulemaking. No public comments were received
on the proposed action. Therefore, EPA is approving New Jersey's SIP revision incorporating Subchapter 21, ``Emission
Statements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this rule should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule makes final the action proposed at 59 FR 15689, April 4, 1994. As noted elsewhere in this notice, EPA received
no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified
this action from Table 2 to Table 3 under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214, January 19, 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements
of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver
for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's
request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on
September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 20, 1993. The revisions concern rules from the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (VCAPCD).
This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving
these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of
the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from hospital sterilizers
and petroleum production, processing, storage, and transfer. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions
into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary
and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 20, 1993 in 58 FR 66324, EPA proposed to approve the following VCAPCD rules into the California SIP: Rule
62.6, Ethylene Oxide-Sterilization and Aeration; Rule 71.1, Crude Oil Production and Separation; and Rule 71.3,
Transfer of Reactive Organic Compound Liquids. These rules were adopted by VCAPCD on July 16, 1991 and June 16, 1992.
The rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on October 25, 1991 and September 14, 1992.
These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment
areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that
interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above
rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 58 FR 66324 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office.

EPA Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing this action to approve the above rules for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the
submittal under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval
action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules
is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of a revision to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 12, 1994. The revisions concern a rule from the Sacramento Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD). This
rule is intended to control volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from degreasing (cleaning) operations. This
final action notice will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving
this rule is to regulate VOC emissions in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA
or the Act). Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of this revision into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA
regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, and
plan requirements for nonattainment areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 22, 1991, the sanctions and FIP clocks were started when EPA determined that the State failed to make a complete
submittal. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on April 28, 1993 when EPA determined that the State had made
a complete submittal. This final action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP and stop the Federal
Implementation Plan clock.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 12, 1994 in 59 FR 1699, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SMAQMD's Rule
454, Degreasing Operations. Rule 454 was adopted by SMAQMD on February 23, 1993. This rule was submitted in response
to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably
available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements
of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for the above rule and nonattainment area is provided
in the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated the above rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above.
EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 1698 and in a technical support document (TSD) available at EPA's Region IX office
(TSD dated June 10, 1993 for Rule 454).

Response to Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 1698. No comments were received by EPA on the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is finalizing action to approve the above rule for inclusion into the California SIP. EPA is approving the submittal
under section 110(k)(3) as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and Part D of the CAA. This approval action will
incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving this rule is to regulate emissions
of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the CAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approval action will incorporate this rule into the federally approved SIP and also stop the Federal Implementation
Plan (FIP) clock. The sanctions and FIP clocks were started on October 22, 1991 when EPA determined that the State failed
to make a complete submittal. The mandatory sanctions clock was stopped on April 28, 1993 when EPA determined that
the State made a complete submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be
considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant
statutory and regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future notice will inform the general public of these tables. On
January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 222) from the
requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for 2 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive
Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 12, 1992, the State of Tennessee through the Memphis and Shelby County Health Department (MSCHD), submitted
a maintenance plan and a request to redesignate the Memphis and Shelby County area (classified as a marginal nonattainment
area) from nonattainment to attainment for ozone (O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area specifically consists of Shelby County. Under the Clean Air Act, designations can be changed
if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes and the redesignation request satisfies the criteria set
forth in the Clean Air Act for redesignations. In this action, EPA is approving the State of Tennessee's submittal
because it meets the maintenance plan and redesignation requirements. The approved maintenance plan will become
a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Memphis and Shelby County area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 15, 1993, in a letter from Patrick M. Tobin to Governor Ned McWherter, the EPA notified the State of Tennessee
that the EPA had made a finding of failure to submit required programs for the nonattainment area. EPA's redesignation
of the Memphis and Shelby County area to attainment abrogates those requirements for this area. Therefore, the sanctions
and federal implementation plan clocks begun by those findings are stopped at the time of the redesignation.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAA) were enacted. (Pub. L. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399,
codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q). Under section 107(d)(1), in conjunction with the Governor of Tennessee,
EPA designated the Memphis and Shelby County area as nonattainment because the area violated the O

area was classified as marginal under section 181(a)(1). (See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991) and 57 FR 56762 (Nov. 30, 1992),

III. Review of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 19, 1993, Region IV determined that the information received from the MSCHD constituted a complete redesignation
request under the general completeness criteria of 40 CFR 51, appendix V, sections 2.1 and 2.2. However, for purposes
of determining what requirements are applicable for redesignation purposes, EPA believes it is necessary to identify
when the MSCHD first submitted a redesignation request that meets the completeness criteria. EPA noted in a previous
policy memorandum that parallel processing requests for submittals under the CAA, including redesignation submittals,
would not be determined complete. See the memorandum entitled ``State Implementation Plan (SIP) Actions Submitted
in Response to Clean Air Act (Act) Deadlines'' from John Calcagni to Air Programs Division Directors, Regions I-X,
dated October 28, 1992 (Memorandum). The rationale for this conclusion was that the parallel processing exception
to the completeness criteria (40 CFR 51, appendix V, section 2.3) was not intended to extend statutory due dates for
mandatory submittals. (See Memorandum at 3&hyph;4). However, since requests for redesignation are not mandatory
submittals under the CAA, EPA believed it appropriate to change its policy with respect to redesignation submittals
to conform to the existing completeness criteria. (See 58 FR 38108 (July 15, 1993)). Therefore, EPA believes, the
parallel processing exception to the completeness criteria may be applied to redesignation request submittals,
at least until such time as the EPA decides to revise that exception. MSCHD submitted a redesignation request on November
12, 1992. In the November 12 submittal, MSCHD submitted the maintenance plan, thereby including the final element
to make the November 12, 1992, request for parallel processing complete under the parallel processing exception
to the completeness criteria. When the maintenance plan became state effective on March 9, 1994, the State of Tennessee
no longer needed parallel processing for the redesignation request and maintenance plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Tennessee redesignation request for the Memphis and Shelby County area meets the five requirements of section
107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation to attainment. The following is a brief description of how the State of Tennessee
has fulfilled each of these requirements. Because the maintenance plan is a critical element of the redesignation
request, EPA will discuss its evaluation of the maintenance plan under its analysis of the redesignation request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Tennessee's request is based on an analysis of quality assured ambient air quality monitoring data which
is relevant to the maintenance plan and to the redesignation request. Ambient air quality monitoring data for calendar
year 1989 through calendar year 1992 show an expected exceedance rate of less than or equal to 1.0 per year of the O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Memphis and Shelby County area. (See 40 CFR 50.9 and appendix H.) One of the two ozone monitoring sites had
no exceedances over this period of time while the other monitor had one exceedance. That exceedance occurred in 1989.
The design value, or the ``fourth highest high,'' of the two monitors for the calendar year period of 1990 through 1992
was 0.117 ppm, down from 0.140 ppm in the period of calendar year 1988 through calendar year 1990, and 0.121 ppm for the
calendar year period of 1989 through 1991. The ozone monitoring year for 1993 ended on October 31, 1993. One monitor
recorded an exceedance of the 0.120 ppm NAAQS during the 1993 season. The State of Tennessee has committed to continue
monitoring in this area in accordance with 40 CFR 58. Because the Memphis and Shelby County area has complete quality-assured
data showing no violations of the standard over the most recent consecutive three calendar year period, the Memphis
and Shelby County area has met the first statutory criterion of attainment of the O

2. The Area Has Met All Applicable Requirements Under Section 110 and Part D of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 6, 1980, and on September 2, 1981, EPA fully approved Tennessee's SIP as meeting the requirements of section
110(a)(2) and part D of the 1977 CAA (45 FR 26038 and 45 FR 59578). The amended CAA, however, revised section 110(a)(2)
and, under part D, revised section 172 and added new requirements for all nonattainment areas. Therefore, for purposes
of redesignation, to meet the requirement that the SIP contain all applicable requirements under the CAA, EPA reviewed
the Tennessee SIP to ensure that it contained all measures due under the amended CAA prior to or at the time the State
of Tennessee submitted its redesignation request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Section 110 Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although section 110 was amended, the Memphis and Shelby County area SIP meets the requirements of amended section
110(a)(2). A number of the requirements did not change in substance and, therefore, EPA believes that the pre-amendment
SIP met these requirements. As to those requirements that were amended, see 57 FR 27936 and 57 FR 27939 (June 23, 1992),
many are duplicative of other requirements of the CAA. EPA has analyzed the SIP and determined that it is consistent
with the requirements of amended section 110(a)(2).

Before the Memphis and Shelby County area may be redesignated to attainment, it also must have fulfilled the applicable
requirements of part D. Under part D, an area's classification indicates the requirements to which it will be subject.
Subpart 1 of part D sets forth the basic nonattainment requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas, classified
as well as nonclassifiable. Subpart 2 of part D establishes additional requirements for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas classified under table 1 of section 181(a). The Memphis and Shelby County area is classified
as marginal (See 56 FR 56694, codified at 40 CFR 81.334). The State of Tennessee submitted their request for redesignation
of the Memphis and Shelby County area prior to November 15, 1992. Therefore, in order to be redesignated to attainment,
the State of Tennessee must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 1 of part D, specifically sections 172(c)
and 176, and the requirements of subpart 2 of part D, which became due on or before November 12, 1992, the date the State
submitted a complete redesignation request. EPA interprets section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) to mean that, for a redesignation
request to be approved, the State must have met all requirements that became applicable to the subject area prior to
or at the time of the submission of the redesignation request. Requirements of the CAA that come due subsequent to the
submission of the redesignation request continue to be applicable to the area (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section 175A(c)) and, if the redesignation is disapproved, the State remains obligated to fulfill those requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B1. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 172.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 172(c) sets forth general requirements applicable to all nonattainment areas. Under section 172(b), the
section 172(c) requirements are applicable as determined by the Administrator but no later than three years after
an area is designated as nonattainment. EPA had not determined that these requirements were applicable to classified

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas on or before November 12, 1992, the date that the State of Tennessee submitted a complete redesignation
request for the Memphis and Shelby County area. Therefore, the State of Tennessee was not required to meet these requirements
for purposes of redesignation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon redesignation of this area to attainment, the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions contained
in part C of title I are applicable. On June 24, 1982, the EPA approved the State of Tennessee's PSD program (47 FR 27269).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B2. Subpart 1 of Part D_Section 176 Conformity Plan Provisions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 176(c) of the CAA requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that
federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable SIP. The requirement
to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded or approved under
Title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other federal actions
(``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by states
must be consistent with federal conformity regulations that the CAA required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided
for the state revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations.
When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's ``General Preamble for the Implementation of title I'' informed
states that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date (see 57 FR 13498, 13557 (April 16, 1992)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993, (58 FR 62188) and general
conformity regulations on November 30, 1993, (58 FR 63214). These conformity rules require that states adopt both
transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance
plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to section 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and section
51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of Tennessee is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation
conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly,
Tennessee is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent
with those established in the federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not
yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval
of this redesignation request.

SIPs. Tennessee submitted the VOC RACT fixups for purposes of redesignating the Memphis and Shelby County area. These
were published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas on November 15, 1992, such as VOC RACT catch-ups, Gasoline Vapor Recovery, New Source Review,
and Emission Statements. Tennessee failed to submit these measures for the Memphis and Shelby County area. On January
15, 1993, EPA made a finding of failure to submit these measures by letter from Patrick M. Tobin, Acting Regional Administrator,
to Ned McWherter, Governor of Tennessee. However these requirements are not applicable for purposes of considering
the State's redesignation request. For purposes of redesignation, EPA must consider whether the State has met all
requirements that were applicable prior to the time the state submitted the redesignation request. Since Tennessee
submitted the redesignation request for Memphis and Shelby County on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 12, 1992, these measures are not relevant for purposes of redesignation. Therefore, all subpart 2 requirements
that were applicable at the time the State submitted its redesignation request have been met. The VOC RACT fixups and
the Alternate Emission Standards were published in the

Based on the approval of provisions under the pre-amended CAA and EPA's prior approval of SIP revisions under the amended
CAA, EPA has determined that the Memphis and Shelby County area has a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which
also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS. The State of Tennessee believes that the predominance of the emission reductions that have occurred, as demonstrated
by a comparison of previous emission inventories versus the 1990 base year emission inventory that was presented
in their supplemental submittal of March 31, 1994 (as attachment E), that air quality has been improved in the Memphis
and Shelby County area as a result of permanent and enforceable emission reductions through local, state and federal
programs. Of significance are emission reductions of point source VOC's from 49,000 tons per year (tpy) in 1979, to
27,633 tpy in 1983, to 14,986 tpy in 1990. The VOC reductions that have occurred are the result of several factors. These
include federal emission limitations and fleet turnover, the Memphis vehicle inspection and maintenance (I&amp;M)
program to enforce the federal limitations and the implementation and enforcement of Shelby County regulations
concerning the construction and operation of VOC emitting sources. These sources are regulated as they relate to
new source requirements for best available control technology (BACT), lowest achievable emission rate (LAER) technology
and offsets, and to existing source requirements calling for the installation of reasonably available control technology
(RACT). The I&amp;M program has been in operation since the mid-1980's and has been improved in its operation from
a quality standpoint since that time. The Savings Clause For Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance [CAA section 187(a)(4)]
insures, at a minimum, the continuation of I&amp;M in the current configuration. Air pollution regulations have
been in existence, in large part, since the 1970's and early 1980's with continued amendments and improvements since
that time. Projections indicate that VOC emissions will not exceed the 1990 baseline inventory before the year 2005.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These reductions have occurred while Memphis has continued to pursue, expand and enhance accountability of sources
both in quality and quantity. Also of significance are reductions in mobile source emissions which may not be readily
apparent from comparisons of the different inventories. Road projects that make up the Transportation Improvement
Plan (TIP) must have a positive impact on air quality. These projects, including some outlying area signal improvements,
a Suburban Transit Center program for the Memphis Area Transit Authority (MATA) and a Land Use/Transportation Systems
Integration Study, should provide some measure for reduction to the mobile source emission inventory. Finally,
road construction or improvement projects, in order to meet conformity requirements, must provide a positive effect
on air quality. The contribution of these projects to air quality is evaluated by computer modelling using MOBILE5A.
This will be quantified annually in the conformity process for TIP approval. However, allowing for the increased
vehicle population and increased vehicle miles travelled, strides have been made in reducing vehicular emissions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State of Tennessee has demonstrated that actual
enforceable emission reductions are responsible for the recent air quality improvement and that the VOC emissions
in the base year are not artificially low due to local economic downturn.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 175A of the CAA sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment
to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least ten years after
the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the State must submit
a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the ten years following the initial ten-year period.
To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures,
with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems.

, and CO emissions from the Memphis and Shelby County area. The inventories included biogenic, area, stationary,
and mobile sources using 1990 as the base year for calculations to demonstrate maintenance. The 1990 inventory is
considered representative of attainment conditions because the NAAQS was not violated during 1990. The 1990 Base
Year Emission Inventory for point sources for the Memphis and Shelby County area has been submitted to EPA in SIP Air
Pollutant Inventory Management Subsystem (SAMS) format. The remaining data has been submitted in tabular format.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Tennessee submittal contains the detailed inventory data and summaries by source location and source
category. This comprehensive base year emissions inventory was submitted in the SAMS format. Finally, this inventory
was prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. A summary of the base year and projected maintenance year inventories
is shown in the following three tables. The CO and the biogenic VOC values are included as a part of the 1990 base year
emission inventory. This notice is approving the base year inventory. Refer to the TSD prepared for this notice for

, and CO emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to 2004. These projected inventories were prepared in
accordance with EPA guidance. Refer to EPA's TSD prepared for this notice for more in-depth details regarding the
projected inventory for the Memphis and Shelby County area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1994, the State of Tennessee submitted supplemental projection inventories. The data submitted for
1993 showed a higher level of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions than the base year, however, the Memphis/Shelby County nonattainment area was still in attainment during
1993. All following years' data is below the 1993 level, therefore, continued attainment is expected. The projected
emissions for 1993 closely approximate actual 1993 data. The NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 levels projected for 1996 and 1999, although higher than the base year levels, are significantly lower than the 1993
levels, which, as noted above, did not cause a violation of the standard. The levels for 2002 and 2004 projected as less
than the attainment year. Although approval of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increases above a de minimis level is a departure from EPA guidance, EPA believes that the emissions projections demonstrate
that the area will continue to maintain the O

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Memphis and Shelby County area depends, in part, on the State of Tennessee's efforts toward tracking indicators
of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The Memphis and Shelby County area will utilize the several
plan elements to maintain current acceptable ozone levels. The air quality monitoring network will continue to operate
in accordance with 40 CFR Part 58, with no reductions to the existing monitoring network. Any relocation of monitors
will be agreed upon by the EPA prior to their relocation. Existing stationary source control will continue. Additional
companies subject to RACT regulations will be added to the source listing, and will be required to comply with emission
standards. Sources wishing to locate in Shelby County will continue to undergo new source review requirements to
include the installation of best available control technology. A triennial emissions inventory will be performed
to include area, mobile and point sources of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. This inventory will
be developed in conjunction with emission inventories for Carbon Monoxide. The first year for inclusion as an inventory
year is 1993, with said inventory to be accomplished by December 31, 1994 and submitted for approval to the State of
Tennessee by January 31, 1995. Successive inventories are to be accomplished using the same procedure. When the triennial
inventory exceeds the projected inventory by more than ten percent, then the inventory development will be increased
to an annual event. Inspection and Maintenance (I &amp; M) of the automobile will continue in the City of Memphis with
an increased emphasis on enforcement to assure vehicle owner participation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the future. Despite the State's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient
air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, the State of Tennessee has provided contingency
measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 air quality problem. The State of Tennessee's contingency plan is triggered by a violation of the Ozone NAAQS of 0.12
ppm that occurs after redesignation to attainment. Plan implementation would begin upon confirmation of an ozone
violation. The plan contains a contingency to implement pre-adopted additional control measures such as Reasonable
Available Control Technology (RACT) level control for not previously controlled VOC sources. Development of requirements
to lower emissions of NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from stationary fuel burning sources would also begin immediately. These pre-adopted additional measures for RACT
will be implemented within 90 days of the date the State certifies to EPA that the air quality data which demonstrates
a violation of the O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regulations would be implemented within two years of the ozone violation. A complete description of these contingency
measures and their triggers can be found in the TSD prepared for this notice. EPA finds that the contingency measures
provided in the State of Tennessee submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA.

E. Subsequent Maintenance Plan Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 175A(b) of the CAA, the State of Tennessee has agreed to submit a revised maintenance SIP
eight years after the area is redesignated to attainment. Such revised SIP will provide for maintenance for an additional
ten years.

Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final action, EPA is approving the Memphis and Shelby County O

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 maintenance plan, including the 1990 base year emission inventory, because it meets the requirements of section
175A. In addition, the EPA is redesignating the Memphis and Shelby County area to attainment for O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the State of Tennessee has demonstrated compliance with the requirements of section 107(d)(3)(E) for redesignation.
This action stops the sanctions and federal implementation plan clocks that were triggered for the Memphis and Shelby
County area by the January 15, 1993, findings letter.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective October 3, 1994 unless, within 30 days of its publication, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
document that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this
action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received,
the public is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Redesignation of an area to attainment under section 107(d)(3)(E) of the CAA does not impose any new requirements
on small entities. Redesignation is an action that affects the status of a geographical area and does not impose any
regulatory requirements on sources. The Administrator certifies that the approval of the redesignation request
will not affect a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607 (b)(1), petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed
in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 3, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration
by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2) of the CAA, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).)

dated October 4, 1993. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions
(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The U.S. EPA has submitted a request
for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such
time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive
Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Prior to the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments the parabolic shaped area of Tacoma extending approximately 31/2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
miles SSW from the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO) Plant was designated nonattainment for sulfur
dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) in relation to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). 43 FR 9043 (March 3, 1978). The primary source
of the pollutant in the Tacoma area was the ASARCO copper smelter, emitting an average of 100 tons of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 per year. On August 6, 1979, based on a stipulated agreement between EPA and ASARCO which was entered in the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (No. 78&hyph;1929), EPA proposed redesignation of Tacoma from nonattainment
to unclassifiable for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (44 FR 45970). EPA revoked the nonattainment designation on November 30, 1979 (44 FR 68834). The redesignation was
intended to defer the requirement for a Part D (Plan Requirements for Nonattainment Areas) SIP revision. Part D of
the CAA requires an applicable implementation plan within 18 months of the designation to nonattainment. The redesignation
to unclassifiable allowed EPA to complete rulemaking action under Section 123 of the Act which would allow the use
of meteorological curtailment programs to meet ambient air quality standards if the program was in place before 1970.
The final rules interpreting Section 123 were published by EPA on April 2, 1986. Through that publication, EPA met
the terms of the settlement agreement and was qualified to redesignate Tacoma under Section 107 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 22, 1993, the State of Washington, on behalf of the Governor, submitted to the EPA Regional Administrator
a request to redesignate the Tacoma area from unclassifiable to attainment. The CAA does not set forth specific requirements
for areas seeking redesignation from unclassifiable to attainment. However, the CAA provides that an attainment
area is an area that meets the national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for a specific pollutant and does not contribute
to poor air quality in a nearby area that does not meet the NAAQS for that pollutant. Therefore, at a minimum, an area
needs to meet the NAAQS in order to be redesignated from unclassifiable to attainment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ambient air quality monitoring from 1980 through 1993 shows attainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Tacoma area. The National Air Monitor System (NAMS) and State/Local Air Monitor System (SLAM) monitoring
locations changed throughout the 11 years. The NAMS locations include 54th Ave NE, Alexander Ave, 26th and Pearl,
Mt Tacoma High School, and Benny's Nursery. Moreover, the state and local standards for air quality are more stringent
than the NAAQS, and exceedances have not been recorded for either of these standards since the ASARCO copper smelter
plant ceased operation as of March 1984. Therefore, EPA has determined that the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in the Tacoma area has been attained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is further assured that the area will remain in attainment because the ASARCO Copper Smelter, the primary source
of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions, permanently ceased operations in March 1984. ASARCO's permanent closure is strengthened by the stack
demolition that occurred on January 17, 1993. After the copper smelter ceased operation there was a considerable
decrease in sulfur dioxide emissions, as indicated by the continuing emission monitoring of the Tacoma area.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA, in this action, is redesignating Tacoma from unclassifiable to attainment for sulfur dioxide. This action is
being taken without prior proposal because the changes are noncontroversial, the State has demonstrated that the
area has attained the standard and that the primary source of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions has permanently ceased operation. Therefore, EPA anticipates no adverse comments on this action.

III. Administrative Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small
businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of
less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve
requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

, 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective October 3, 1994 unless, within 30 days of its publication, adverse or critical comments are received.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
notice that will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any
parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public
is advised that this action will be effective October 3, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions
of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms
with those requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting
Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by October 3, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the
Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does
it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section
307(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(2).

 This order partially revokes an Executive order insofar as it affects 640 acres of National Forest System land withdrawn
for the Bureau of Land Management's Coal Reserve Montana No. 1. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which
it was withdrawn. The revocation is needed to finalize the Forest Service exchange provided for in Public Law 103&hyph;91,
which mandated that the exchange be completed and clear title issued. This action will open the land to surface entry
and mining. The land has been and will remain open to mineral leasing.

The Commission has amended its rules regarding the appointment of the Designated Agency Ethics Official (DAEO) and
the Alternate Designated Agency Ethics Official (ADEO). Personnel in the Office of General Counsel have been designated
to be the DAEO and ADEO. This change will consolidate management of the ethics program established by the February
3, 1993 regulations of the Office of Government Ethics that established new uniform standards of ethical conduct
for officers and employers of the executive branch of the Federal Government.

In the matter of: Amendment of Parts 0 and 19 of the Commission's Rules of Commission Organization and Governing Employee
Standards of Ethical Conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adopted: July 20, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
By the Commission:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On February 3, 1993, regulations of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) that establish new uniform standards
of ethical conduct for officers and employees of the executive branch of the Federal Government became effective.
See 5 CFR 2635, 57 FR 35006 August 7, (1992).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 OGE regulations also require the Commission to formally designate an agency official to be the ``designated agency
ethics official'' or ``DAEO'' to coordinate and manage the Commission's ethics program. In addition, these regulations
require the agency to appoint an alternate DAEO or ``ADAEO'' to serve in an acting capacity in the absence of the primary
designated agency ethics official. See 5 CFR 2638.201&hyph;2638.202. The purpose of this Order is to designate personnel
in the Office of General Counsel to those positions and to make the necessary changes in the Commission's rules to effect
that designation. Specifically, this Order delegates authority to the General Counsel to assume the responsibilities
of the DAEO and to implement the ethics program established in the new OGE regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the scheme established in the new OGC regulations, most of the Commission's existing Part 19 rules have been
superseded by OGE'S regulations. We will restructure Part 19 to remove the superseded sections and to renumber the
provisions that may be retained in accordance with the OGE regulations in a future order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
2. Under the OGE regulations, the DAEO is required to be qualified to counsel agency personnel concerning the new OGE
ethics standards and to counsel departing and former agency officials on post-employment conflict of interest standards.
5 CFR 2638.202(b)(3)&hyph;(4). In addition, the DAEO has responsibility for managing the agency's ethics program,
including liaison with OGE, reviewing financial disclosure reports, monitoring ethics training, and monitoring
administrative actions and sanctions. The DAEO may appoint ``deputy'' ethics officials to perform any of these functions,
but such deputies work under the DAEO's supervision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 CFR 2638.204.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Under current Commission rules, the General Counsel has broad delegated authority to provide ethics counseling,
and other duties that are very similar to the principal functions performed by the DAEO under OGE's regulations. Specifically,
the General Counsel now has overall delegated authority to act as ``legal counselor for the Commission to provide
guidance on matters relating to ethical conduct,'' and to serve as the ``Commission's designee to the Office of Personnel
Management'' on matters covered by the OPM (now OGE) rules governing ethical conduct. 47 CFR 19.735&hyph;105(a)(1).
In fact, most of the responsibilities set forth in the OGE regulations, with the exception of the management of the
financial disclosure statements, are already delegated to the Commission's General Counsel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Commission rules give the Chief, Operations Support Division authority to serve as the designated agency
ethics official for the purpose of receiving, reviewing and certifying financial disclosure statements. See 47
CFR 0.231(h).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Our informal survey of other agencies also indicates that designating the senior legal official as the DAEO is consistent
with the general practice of agencies of similar size. In light of these factors, we think it is appropriate to designate
the General Counsel as the DAEO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Accordingly we shall add a new &sect;0.251(a) to delegate authority to the General Counsel to act as the ``designated
agency ethics official.'' The rule will delegate authority to the Associate General Counsel for Administrative
Law to act as the ``alternate designated agency ethics official.''

, the Commission adopts a multiplier for use to determine whether interests in cellular and broadband PCS licensees
held indirectly through intervening corporate entities should be attributed for purposes of the Commission's broadband
PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. This action is taken so that these rules can
be more effectively enforced consistent with their intent, which is to ensure that broadband PCS licensees lack any
incentive to impede the development of full competition with the cellular licensees or with other broadband PCS licensees
in the same geographic area.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding, FCC 94&hyph;144, 59 FR 32830 (June 24, 1994) (``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
''), we reaffirmed our bright-line cross-ownership attribution standards, which apply to common ownership of licenses
in the Domestic Public Cellular Radio Telecommunications Service (``cellular'') and the Personal Communications
Services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband PCS''). We also ruled that no entity would be permitted to hold broadband PCS
licenses comprising more than 40 MHz of spectrum in a particular PCS service area. The purpose of both the broadband
PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and the broadband PCS spectrum cap rule is to ensure that broadband PCS licensees
lack any incentive to impede the development of full competition with the cellular licensees or with other broadband
PCS licensees in the same geographic area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We determined that an interest of 20 percent or more in a cellular license will be attributable,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and that an interest of 5 percent or more in a broadband PCS license will be attributable. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para;&para;109&hyph;110. Under the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule, entities with attributable
ownership of a cellular license covering 10 percent or more of the population of a broadband PCS service area are limited
to holding one 10 MHz broadband PCS license in that broadband PCS service area until January 1, 2000. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 24.204. Under the broadband PCS spectrum cap rule, parties are not permitted to hold attributable interests
in licenses covering more than 40 MHz in the same PCS service area. See 47 CFR 24.229(c). In determining how to calculate
a party's interest in a cellular licensee when it is held through multiple tiers of entities, we stated that the interest
of a subsidiary is attributed in full to the parent. See

3. Herein we reconsider, on our own motion, the issue of whether to use a ``multiplier'' to determine how interests
in cellular and broadband PCS licensees held indirectly through intervening corporate entities should be attributed.
A multiplier is currently used by the Commission in our attribution rules in the broadcast context. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 47 CFR 73.3555, note 2(d). To determine the ``true'' ownership interest of a party whose interest in a broadcast licensee
is held through intervening entities, each non-majority, non-controlling interest is multiplied together. For
example, a party that owns a 25 percent non-controlling interest in a corporation that has a 10 percent non-controlling
interest in a licensee would be deemed to have a 2.5 percent interest in the licensee. As we concluded in adopting a multiplier
for broadcast attribution, use of a multiplier allows the Commission to accurately take account of a party's ``actual
involvement with the ultimate licensee'' as well as its ability to exert control over the actions of the licensee.

, 1 FCC Red 802 (1986), 52 FR 1630 (Jan. 15, 1987). We concluded that ``use of a multiplier would more realistically reflect
a party's attenuated interest in a licensee where there are intervening corporations, than does the present practice
of fully attributing any interest above the benchmark through each intervening corporation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we favored a bright-line test because we believed that it would result in a faster, less burdensome licensing process.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Memorandum Opinion and Order 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at &para; 113. On reconsideration, however, we have concluded that adding use of a multiplier will allow us to more
effectively enforce the broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership and broadband PCS spectrum cap rules consistent
with their intent. We also conclude that using a multiplier is consistent with our policy goal of promoting full competition
in wireless markets, because it will not cause the exclusion of firms that pose no threat to competition. Without a
multiplier, parties that have neither the ability to exert control nor a substantial financial stake in the cellular
or broadband PCS license could be unduly restricted in acquiring interests in such license. Furthermore, absent
a multiplier, anomalous and unintended results occur. For example, if Company A holds a 21 percent non-controlling
interest in Company B, which in turn holds a 30 percent non-controlling interest in Company X, a cellular licensee,
Company A's attributable interest in Company X would be deemed to be 30 percent, in excess of the 20 percent threshold
applicable to broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership. Company A would thus be limited to acquiring a 10 MHz broadband
PCS license in Company X's cellular service area, even though it has neither the ability to exert control or significant
influence over the operations of Company X's cellular system nor a financial stake in Company X so substantial as to
give rise to an incentive to engage in anticompetitive conduct. In comparison, by using a multiplier, Company A's
attributable interest in Company X would be 6.3 percent (0.21&times;0.3), under the 20 percent attribution threshold,
and Company A would not be restricted to 10 MHz broadband PCS licenses in Company X's cellular service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Considerations of ``actual involvement'' with, true economic interest in, and ability to control a licensee are
crucial in determining whether a particular indirect ownership interest should be attributed to the holder for purposes
of our cross-ownership and multiple ownership rules. These considerations apply with equal force in the broadcast,
broadband PCS and cellular contexts; thus, we conclude that a multiplier similar to that used in applying our attribution
rules in the broadcast area should be adopted for purposes of determining attributable interests in cellular and
broadband PCS licensees. We therefore will amend &sect;24.204 of our Rules to include use of a multiplier to determine
whether an entity holding indirect non-controlling interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant
or licensee has an attributable interest for purposes of our broadband PCS/cellular cross-ownership rule and our
broadband PCS spectrum cap rule. For purposes of applying the multiplier, where an entity's ownership interest in
any particular link in the ownership chain is greater than 50 percent or is controlling, the interest will be treated
as if it were 100 percent.

(viii) Ownership interests in a cellular licensee or a broadband PCS applicant or licensee that are held indirectly
by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the
ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution
benchmark to the resulting product, except that if the ownership percentage for an interest in any link in the chain
exceeds 50 percent or represents actual control, it shall be treated as if it were a 100 percent interest. [For example,
if A owns 10 percent of Company X, which owns 35 percent of, and controls, Company Y, which owns 25 percent of Licensee,
then Company X's attributable interest in Licensee would be 25 percent, and A's attributable interest in Licensee
would be 2.5 percent (0.1&times;0.25).]

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the GOA exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the
Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the GOA (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council
under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations
implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the TAC for thornyhead rockfish in the GOA was established by the
final 1994 specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 1,180 metric tons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined in accordance with &sect;672.20(c)(3), that the TAC for thornyhead
rockfish in the GOA has been reached. Therefore, NMFS is requiring that further catches of thornyhead rockfish in
the GOA be treated as prohibited species in accordance with &sect;672.20(e), effective from 12 noon, A.l.t. August
1, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is promulgating a rule governing the order in which the sanctions shall apply under the mandatory sanctions
provision of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended, after EPA makes a finding of failure specific to any State implementation
plan (SIP) or plan revision required under the Act's nonattainment area provisions. This final rule provides that
the offset sanction shall apply in an area 18 months after the date on which EPA makes such a finding with regard to that
area and that the highway sanctions shall apply in that area 6 months following application of the offset sanction.
Once this rule is effective, sanctions will apply automatically in the sequence prescribed in all instances in which
sanctions are required following applicable findings that EPA has already made or that EPA will make in the future,
except when EPA determines through a separate rulemaking to change the sanction sequence for one or more specific
circumstances. The public will have an opportunity to comment on any such separate rulemaking.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1, 1993, EPA proposed a rule (58 FR 51270) governing the sequence of mandatory sanctions under section 179(a)
(42 U.S.C. 7509(a)) of the amended Act. The document included extensive background on the Act, some of which is briefly
resummarized in this background section because it relates directly to the Act's sanction provisions. The information
not repeated concerns the overview at pages 51270&hyph;2 of the proposal provided on the Clean Air Act Amendments
of 1990 (1990 Amendments), title I requirements of the Act, and EPA action on SIP's. This background section also summarizes
the proposal and the rationale.

1. Section 179(a) Scope and Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments revised the law concerning sanctions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to address State failures to comply with the requirements of the Act. Under section 179(a) of the Act, for any plan or
plan revision required under part D of title I or required in response to a finding of substantial SIP inadequacy under
section 110(k)(5) (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(5)),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Act sets forth four findings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that EPA can make, which may lead to the application of one or both of the sanctions specified under section 179(b) (42
U.S.C. 7509(b)). The four findings are: (1) A finding under section 179(a)(1) that a State has failed, for a nonattainment
area, to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP, or that a submitted SIP or SIP element fails to meet the completeness criteria
established pursuant to section 110(k) (42 U.S.C. 7410(k)); (2) a finding under section 179(a)(2) where EPA disapproves
a SIP submission for a nonattainment area based on its failure to meet one or more plan elements required by the Act;
(3) a finding under section 179(a)(3) that the State has not made any other submission required by the Act (including
an adequate maintenance plan) or has made any other submission that fails to meet the completeness criteria or has
made a required submission that is disapproved by EPA for not meeting the Act's requirements; or (4) a finding under
section 179(a)(4) that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 Amendments also revised the Act's provisions concerning Federal implementation plans (FIP's). Under section
110(c)(1), the FIP requirement is triggered by an EPA finding that a State has failed to make a required submittal or
that a received submittal does not satisfy the minimum completeness criteria established under section 110(k)(1)(A),
or an EPA disapproval of a SIP submittal in whole or in part. However, since FIP's are not the subject of this notice,
these provisions are not addressed here.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5)_known as a ``SIP call''_is made whenever EPA finds that
a plan for any area is substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant national ambient air quality standard
(NAAQS).

Section 179(a) refers to findings, disapprovals, and determinations. These will all be referred to by the one term
``findings.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA makes section 179(a) findings of failure to submit and findings of incompleteness via letters from EPA Regional
Administrators to State governors or other State officers to whom authority has been delegated.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The letter itself triggers the sanctions clock. To make findings of failure to submit and findings of incompleteness
under section 179(a)(1) and section 179(a)(3)(A), EPA is not required to go through notice-and-comment rulemaking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

clock. For section 179(a)(4) findings of nonimplementation, the sanctions clock starts when EPA makes a finding
of nonimplementation in the

2. Section 179(b) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(b), two sanctions are available for selection by EPA following a section 179(a) finding.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One available sanction is a restriction on highway funding, as provided in section 179(b)(1) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(1)),
which is discussed in the proposal at pages 51273&hyph;51274. The other available sanction is the offset sanction,
as provided in section 179(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 7509(b)(2)), which is also discussed in the proposal at page 51274. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, section 179(a) provides for an air pollution grant sanction that applies to grants the EPA may award under
section 105. However, since it is not a sanction provided under section 179(b), it is not one of the sanctions that automatically
apply under section 179(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Application and Timing of Section 179(b) Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although application of section 179(b) sanctions may become mandatory when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a)
(if the State does not correct the deficiency), it is not immediate. Instead, section 179(a) provides for a sanction
``clock,'' which is described in the proposal at page 51274. Generally, under section 179(a)'s sanction clock, the
sanction selected by EPA applies if the deficiency that prompted the finding is not corrected before the sanction
clock expires. (The sanction clock is further discussed in section II.B.3. of this document.)

C. Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposal, EPA proposed that the section 179(b)(2) offset sanction would apply in an area 18 months from the date
when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a). Furthermore, EPA proposed that the section 179(b)(1) highway sanction
would apply in an area 6 months following application of the offset sanction. The EPA proposed to sequence the application
of sanctions under section 179(a) in this manner in all cases unless EPA determines, through individual notice-and-comment
rulemaking, that the highway sanction will apply first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal addressed the sequence in which sanctions shall apply as required under section 179(a) with respect
to a finding made under subsections (1)&hyph;(4) specific to any implementation plan or plan revision required under
part D or any implementation plan or revision required under part D found substantially inadequate pursuant to section
110(k)(5). In general, part D plans and plan revisions are required for areas designated nonattainment under section
107.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal did not encompass findings EPA can make under section 179(a) regarding SIP calls for non-part D plans
or plan revisions or the sanction provisions in section 110(m) of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It also does not encompass any findings EPA may make under other titles of the Act (e.g., section 502(d) for operating
permitting programs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
While part D generally applies to nonattainment areas, some requirements extend to other areas. For example, section
184(a) specifically created at enactment an ozone transport region, called the Northeast Ozone Transport Region
(NOTR), which is comprised of several mid-Atlantic and New England States and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical
Area containing the District of Columbia (see ``General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990'' at page 13527 (57 FR 13498)). Though areas within some of these States may not be designated
nonattainment, the States must submit revisions to their SIP's by certain statutory deadlines to include specific
part D measures for these areas (e.g., enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance program, reasonably available
control technology for volatile organic compounds (VOC) sources).

Section 110(m) of the Act grants EPA broad discretionary authority to apply either sanction listed in section 179(b)
``at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes'' a finding under section 179(a) with respect to any portion
of the State, subject to certain limitations (57 FR 44534, Sept. 28, 1993). The selection of sanctions being made by
this action, however, does not apply to the imposition of sanctions by EPA under section 110(m). Note that sanction
selection for section 110(m) findings will be made through notice-and-comment rulemaking independent from this
action.

2. Rationale for Sanction Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At pages 51274&hyph;51275 of the proposal, EPA described the purpose sanctions can serve. One function is to encourage
compliance with the Act's requirements. A second function of sanctions is to protect and preserve air quality in areas
until the deficiency prompting the sanctions-initiating finding can be corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal at page 51275, for three reasons, EPA proposed that, as a general matter, the offset sanction apply
at 18 months followed by the highway sanction 6 months thereafter. First, EPA stated that conceptually the offset
sanction will, in general, provide a more certain air quality benefit in the shorter and longer term than the highway
sanction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the proposal stated the offset sanction provides greater potential for more significant air quality protection
because it potentially affects all categories of stationary sources and, depending on the pollutant(s) addressed
in the deficiency prompting the finding, may affect all criteria pollutants (i.e., pollutants for which EPA has promulgated
national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) such as carbon monoxide (CO), PM&hyph;10 (particles with an aerodynamic
diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers), etc.). By contrast, the highway sanction would affect only
mobile sources and pollutants emitted by mobile sources. (Mobile sources are not, for instance, regarded as significant
emitters of lead and sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in addition to air quality considerations, the 2-to-1 offset sanction is less complicated to implement and
administer than the highway sanction by its very nature and because of the manner in which EPA intends to effectuate
it, as discussed in the proposal at pages 51275&hyph;51277. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA noted in the proposal that it does not regard sanctions as a long-term solution to air quality problems
but rather intends to work with States to resolve deficiencies as rapidly as possible. Thus, by applying the offset
sanction at 18 months, if the State corrects the deficiency prompting the finding prior to 6 months thereafter, then
the highway sanction would not apply and EPA and other affected agencies (most notably the Department of Transportation
(DOT)) would not be faced with its comparatively greater implementation and administration burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA, therefore, proposed, as a general matter, that the offset sanction apply before the highway funding sanction
following a section 179(a) finding. The EPA recognized, however, that in specific cases the particular circumstances
may lead EPA to conclude that it is more appropriate for the highway sanction to apply first. Therefore, EPA has specifically
noted that it may go through notice-and-comment rulemaking for the highway sanction to apply after 18 months and the
offset sanction 6 months thereafter. (The sanction sequence rationale is further discussed in section II.B.1. of
this document.)

3. Sanction Effectuation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At pages 51275&hyph;51277 of the proposal, EPA describes how the offset sanction applies and notes that, under the
highway sanction, EPA imposes a prohibition on approval by the Secretary of DOT of certain highway projects and grants.
Thus, the highway sanction is not directly implemented by EPA. However, EPA noted that it is in the process of developing
procedures with DOT to provide for the coordinated implementation of the highway sanction. (Sanction effectuation
is further discussed in section II.B.2 of this document.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Opportunity for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, under section 179(a), the Act requires that sanctions apply if the deficiency that prompted EPA's
finding is not corrected within the timeframes prescribed. The only discretion afforded EPA is which of the two section
179(b) sanctions applies at 18 months and which 6 months thereafter. The proposal noted that if in the future EPA makes
exceptions to this rule, then in individual notice-and-comment rulemakings EPA will seek comment on whether the
highway sanction shall apply after 18 months and the offset sanction shall apply 6 months thereafter given the circumstances
at hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also noted that the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) provides citizens with a means that could be used
to petition EPA to propose that the highway sanction apply first. The APA, 5 U.S.C. 553(e), provides that ``Each agency
(including EPA) shall give an interested person the right to petition for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.''
This provision could conceivably be invoked by a citizen to petition EPA to propose that the highway sanction apply
first with respect to a section 179(a) finding covered by this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Today's Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By this document, EPA is promulgating a rule which provides that the section 179(b)(2) offset sanction shall apply
in an area 18 months from the date when EPA makes a finding under section 179(a) with regard to that area if the deficiency
prompting the finding is not corrected within such period. The final rule also provides that the section 179(b)(1)
highway sanction shall apply in an area 6 months following application of the offset sanction in cases where the deficiency
has still not been corrected within that period. The section 179(b) sanctions shall be sequenced in this manner in
all cases unless EPA proposes the highway sanction to apply first through separate notice-and-comment rulemaking.
This final rule applies to plan or plan revisions required under part D but does not apply to plans or plan revisions
required under part D found substantially inadequate pursuant to section 110(k)(5). The proposed rule applied to
both types of SIP's; a discussion of why the latter type of SIP's_commonly known as part D ``SIP calls''_are not covered
by the final rule is in section II.C.3. This rule also has the immediate effect of applying the offset sanction on September
6, 1994 in affected areas for which the Administrator has not determined that the 18-month sanction clock has expired
by that date and for which the deficiency prompting the finding has not been corrected by that date. Specifically,
in the notice section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is providing a list of areas that will be potentially subject to sanctions on September 6, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the proposed rule did include tables in which EPA intended to list areas subject to sanctions. In the final
rule, EPA has removed the tables from the rule and decided to provide information on areas that will be potentially
subject to sanctions in the separate notice mentioned above. (Sections II.C.5. and III.B. below include a discussion
of why the tables were removed from the proposed rule and why such removal does not carry any substantive significance.)

Summary of Comments.

The EPA's proposal for the sequence of mandatory sanctions and the rationale are provided in sections I.C.1. and I.C.2.
of this document, as well as in the proposal at pages 51274&hyph;5. The EPA received 14 comments on this part of the proposed
rule. Comments on the sanction sequence and rationale can generally be considered in four groups: (1) Commenters
who believe the sequence should be reversed with the highway sanction applying first, (2) commenters who believe
that EPA should determine sanction order on a case-by-case basis, (3) commenters who believe that the nature of the
deficiency should be considered in determining sanction sequence, and (4) commenters who support the sequence as
proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters stated that the sequence in which sanctions apply should be reversed with the highway sanction generally
applying first. Several of the commenters contend that the highway sanction will be more effective at compelling
State correction of SIP deficiencies because it would have greater economic impact, and it will be more effective
at addressing political and statewide failures. One commenter disagrees with EPA's rationale that the offset sanction
is more likely to produce a greater air quality benefit, arguing instead that the highway sanction better encourages
early State compliance. Several commenters challenge EPA's rationale that the offset sanction potentially applies
to all criteria pollutants; the commenters argue that the fact that stationary sources emit more types of pollutants
is irrelevant since, in the proposed rule, the offset sanction applies only to the pollutant(s) in the deficiency.
The commenters also raise an argument that EPA's proposed sequence unfairly burdens industry when the SIP deficiency
is State-caused and that sources will be unfairly penalized due to project location and timing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters believe that EPA should determine sanction order on a case-by-case basis. These commenters express
concern that EPA's streamlined approach provides insufficient notice of sanctions and leaves many sanction application
details unclear. One commenter argues that EPA should streamline its own rulemaking processes rather than deny notice
to affected parties. These commenters were also concerned that general application of the offset sanction would
negatively impact stationary sources. One commenter argues economic competitiveness and air quality will deteriorate
under the offset sanction. Two commenters were concerned that because of the length of the EPA rulemaking process
stationary sources will bear the brunt of the sanction burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters believe that the nature of the SIP deficiency should be considered in determining sanction sequence.
One commenter believes that the sanction chosen should be linked to the SIP deficiency and that EPA must conduct notice-and-comment
rulemaking to determine whether the highway sanction applies first as to specific types of SIP deficiencies. The
commenter is concerned that stationary sources will bear the brunt of the sanctions burden, and that this result could
stifle economic development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters support the proposed sequence of sanctions. One commenter supports the position that the link between
the highway sanction and air quality benefits is uncertain and another commenter agrees that the offset sanction
provides a quantifiable and more likely air quality benefit. Another commenter supported EPA's concerns regarding
the administrative and implementation burdens of the highway sanction as a basis for the offset sanction applying
first.

Response to Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this final rule, EPA has maintained the proposed sanction sequence with the offset sanction generally applying
first and the highway sanction second. The EPA continues to believe this sequence is supported by the proposed rationales
that the offset sanction (compared to the highway sanction) will: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Provide a more certain and direct air quality benefit, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Potentially affect more criteria pollutants, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be easier to implement and administer. The EPA disagrees with the comments that highway sanctions will always
more effectively address SIP-related deficiencies and should, therefore, be generally applied first. In addition,
EPA does believe that the offset sanction will more likely produce a net air quality benefit. In some cases, the offset
sanction may be more effective at resolving SIP deficiencies. For example, in an area that is undergoing significant
economic growth, the offset sanction could help bring pressure through stationary sources wishing to expand or locate
in the area and which are faced with the need for an additional emission offset increment. Furthermore, offsets achieved
by such a sanction would benefit air quality in the affected area. However, in particular instances, the EPA does not
deny that the offset sanction may not be as effective because, for example, the area may be economically depressed
and not experiencing growth. In such a case, there may be less air quality benefit and perhaps less pressure to correct
the deficiency in applying the offset sanction first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, overall EPA continues to believe that conceptually the offset sanction (compared to the highway sanction)
provides a more certain, direct air quality benefit in the near and long term and potentially covers more pollutants.
An increased new source review (NSR) offset ratio necessarily reduces air pollutant emissions as sources modify
or locate in an area under the offset sanction. By contrast, the highway sanction may not directly reduce overall motor
vehicle emissions in the near term and any air quality benefits resulting from the highway sanction would be indirect,
as application of the highway sanction would not necessarily prevent motorists from driving, nor even necessarily
result in overall emissions reductions, at least in the short term. The EPA recognizes that in some instances it may
be more appropriate for the highway sanction to apply to address a political failure and believes there are adequate
mechanisms provided under the rule to address these instances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA did not intend to suggest in the proposal that the offset sanction will apply, in every case, to all criteria
pollutants. The offset sanction will apply only to all criteria pollutants (and their precursors) for which the area
is subject to the section 173 (42 U.S.C. 7503) offset requirement when the SIP deficiency is general in nature. When
the finding is specific to one or more pollutants (and its/their precursor(s)), the sanction applies only to those
pollutants (and/or precursor(s)). The statement in the proposal intended that the offset can potentially affect
all criteria pollutants, either because of pollutant-specific findings or general findings. This means that, regardless
of whether the finding is pollutant-specific or general, the offset sanction will generally apply at least to the
pollutants of direct concern, and sometimes to others as well. On the other hand, the highway sanction will potentially
affect only those pollutants mobile sources emit significantly and not, for instance, lead or SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, EPA also realizes that since CO nonattainment area problems are due primarily to mobile sources, arguably
application of the offset sanction may not address the more significant sources contributing to CO nonattainment
problems. Nonetheless, the offset sanction still applies to CO for nonattainment NSR purposes and thus will affect
sources subject to nonattainment NSR that wish to locate or expand in a CO nonattainment area, which would provide
some air quality benefit in the area under the offset sanction. Therefore, EPA continues to believe that overall the
offset sanction is more likely to produce a greater air quality benefit than the highway sanction because, as sources
locate in an area, direct emission reductions will be achieved through the 2-to-1 offset for potentially any of the
criteria pollutants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to imposing sanctions on a case-by-case basis, EPA believes there are two main disadvantages to this
approach which have led EPA to reject it. First, the individual notice-and-comment rulemakings that would be needed
for implementing the sanctions on a case-by-case basis would impose significant demands on EPA's resources. These
resources could otherwise be spent on activities that more directly serve the goal of the Act, namely, clean air. Second,
the approach taken in the final rule will provide certainty and sufficient notification to the parties affected about
the details of sanction application and consistency in the implementation of section 179. These details are further
discussed in section III.A. and in the detailed summary of comments document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to establishing a rule that links the first sanction to the deficiency on which the sanction is based, EPA believes
that approach fails to consider other important considerations with respect to sanctions such as which sanction
is more likely to yield the greater air quality benefit. The EPA believes, as a general matter, that the sanction that
results in the greater air quality benefit is a more important consideration than selecting the sanction sequence
based primarily on the nature of the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, EPA recognizes that in some cases it may be more appropriate to apply the highway sanction first if
the circumstances of the deficiency warrant and the offset sanction is unlikely to yield significant air quality
benefits. The EPA believes the rule provides the flexibility to do so. Additionally, EPA cannot predict, across all
sanction findings, which sanction will more effectively address State inaction and thus could not base the general
sanction sequence proposal on that factor. Fundamentally, EPA has based its sanction sequencing rationale primarily
on the basis of which sanction EPA believes is likely to yield the greater air quality benefit. It is impossible to gauge
the impact since the universe of areas which will be sanctioned and for what duration are not known.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA does not disagree that the offset sanction has the potential to impact industry and that this burden may be greater
on industry than on the transportation sector. However, by including the offset sanction in the Act, Congress clearly
intended that certain sources, by virtue of the timing and location of their projects, would be impacted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A discussion of EPA's approach for effectuating the offset and highway sanctions is provided in section I.C.3. of
this document and at pages 51275&hyph;7 of the proposal. The following is a brief summary of major comments and EPA's
responses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Major Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Offset Sanction. Comments on offset sanction effectuation addressed both the source and pollutant applicability
aspects of EPA's proposal. One commenter objects to the timing of the applicability of the offset sanction and believes
EPA's proposed approach is contrary to past EPA practice. The commenter argues that applying the increased offset
ratio to all sources that have not received a permit as of the date the sanction begins would stop many sources during
the permitting process for reasons beyond their control. The commenter believes that in the past EPA has avoided these
problems by applying tighter NSR requirements only where permit applications were not complete when the requirements
became effective. The commenter recommends EPA continue with this approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments concern the pollutant applicability of the offset sanction. One commenter objects to the application
of the offset requirement to both ozone precursors (nitrogen oxides (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and volatile organic compounds (VOC)) even when the deficiency relates only to one of the pollutants. In support,
the commenter notes the broad nature of section 179 and the manner in which NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are treated under the Act vis-a-vis VOC emissions. Regarding PM&hyph;10 precursors, the commenter argues
that the offset sanction should apply to precursors only in those areas where EPA has approved a PM&hyph;10 SIP control
strategy imposing the offset requirement on PM&hyph;10 precursors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter believes that regardless of the SIP deficiency the offset sanction should apply to all criteria
pollutants and precursors. In support, the commenter argues that section 179 references section 173, which applies
to all offset requirements in title I of the Act, and that this reflects a clear Congressional intent to apply the offset
sanction to these pollutants. The commenter also believes that areas that have not yet received a section 182(f) (42
U.S.C. 7511a(f)) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption from the section 173 offset requirements should remain subject to the increased offset ratio for NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 until EPA grants an exemption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Highway Sanction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requests that the rule include a requirement that EPA notify several government entities of highway
sanctions to focus multi-agency resources on resolving SIP deficiencies. Another commenter believes that the flow
of flexible funds for certain programs (e.g., congestion mitigation air quality improvement program) should continue
to flow if sanctions apply because the funds are important for achieving the Act's goals by improving transit.

Response to Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Offset Sanction Applicability. Regarding offset sanction source and pollutant applicability, in the final
rule, EPA has maintained the approaches in the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On source applicability, EPA believes it is important to maximize the air quality benefit of the offset sanction by
requiring that sources whose permits are issued after the date the offset sanction applies comply with a 2-to-1 emission
offset requirement. Contrary to the comment, the source applicability definition is not a departure from all past
EPA practices because historically EPA has not always used the ``complete application'' definition. (The different
source applicability definitions EPA has used in the past are discussed in the detailed response to comments document.)
Therefore, EPA believes that past practice does not constrain it from determining today that it is important to enhance
the effectiveness of the offset sanction by defining source applicability on a permit issuance basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA believes that once the offset sanction applies, it would be a violation of the sanction for a permit to
be issued with an emission offset of less than 2-to-1. The plain language of section 179(a) and section 179(b)(2) does
not provide for nor contemplate any grace period based on whether a source has submitted a complete application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding pollutant applicability of the offset sanction, EPA believes the proposed applicability is reasonably
supported and will have the potential to effectively protect air quality. Section 179(b)(2) generally references
the offset requirements of section 173 and does not restrict EPA's ability to base the applicability of the sanction
on a pollutant or pollutants (and its/their precursor(s)). Moreover, pollutant-specific application of the offset
sanction is consistent with the requirements of section 179. Section 179(b)(2)'s language providing that ``the
ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be at least 2 to 1'' is general enough such that EPA can determine
the most reasonable method to apply the sanction. While section 179(b)(2) references the broader section 173 requirement,
EPA believes it is more reasonable, with one caveat,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to apply the offset sanction to the criteria pollutants specifically related to the SIP deficiency in question. Pollutant-specific
application of the offset sanction will encourage the State to correct its SIP deficiencies and will provide reductions
in emissions of the relevant pollutant in the interim, without unnecessarily punishing stationary sources in cases
where the State's program for other pollutants is adequate.

Where the SIP deficiency is general, the offset sanction applies to the criteria pollutant(s) (and its/their precursor(s))

for general SIP deficiencies is also discussed in section II.C.5. below.)

Regarding ozone and PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA is maintaining the approach in the proposal that the sanction applies
to ozone and PM&hyph;10 precursors. The caveat to that general rule has expanded in one minor respect with respect
to the ozone precursor NO

 nonattainment NSR requirements should not apply. In addition, EPA has added the exception that if the area otherwise
is not subject to the section 173 offset requirement for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (e.g., submarginal ozone nonattainment areas), then sources in that area would not be subject to that requirement
under the offset sanction (see sections 182(f) and 182(b)(2)). This exception is necessary in light of the specific
language of the offset provision, which ties the offset sanction specifically to offsets required under section
173. For PM&hyph;10 precursors, EPA has retained the caveat for cases in which EPA has made a section 189(e) (42 U.S.C.
7513a(e)) determination for an area that PM&hyph;10 precursors are not significant.

Summary of Proposal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 Under that interpretation, once the sanctions clock has started upon EPA making a finding under section 179(a), in
order to stop the clock, EPA must determine that the State has corrected the deficiency that prompted the finding.
Similarly, to remove section 179(b) sanctions applied under section 179(a), EPA must determine that the State has
come into compliance by correcting the deficiency that prompted the finding that resulted in the application of one
or both sanctions.

For general guidance on EPA's interpretation, at the time of proposal, of how the sanctions clock functions and what
is necessary to stop it, see the memorandum entitled ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals''
from John Calcagni to Air Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, July 9, 1992. A copy of this memorandum has been placed

For a finding that a State has failed to submit a SIP or an element of a SIP, or that the SIP or SIP element submitted fails
to meet the completeness criteria of section 110(k), the proposal provided that EPA will stop the sanctions clock
or remove any sanctions applied upon EPA's determination that the State has submitted the missing plan or plan element
and that the submittal meets the completeness criteria established pursuant to section 110(k)(1). Note that EPA's
July 9, 1992 SIP processing guidance indicated that if the 18-month sanction clock elapses during a completeness
review, sanctions would not be imposed unless and until EPA determined the plan to be incomplete.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In such a case, the 18-month clock would continue to run so that if EPA determined the plan to be incomplete after 18-months
had elapsed, sanctions would immediately apply.

would continue to apply upon State submittal until the submittal was determined to be complete.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal provided that if EPA disapproves a SIP submission based on its failure to meet one or more plan elements
required by the Act, to correct the deficiency for purposes of stopping the sanctions clock or removing the sanction,
the State must submit a revised SIP to EPA and EPA must approve that submittal pursuant to section 110(k). For a finding
that a requirement of an approved plan is not being implemented, the proposal provided that the sanctions clock would
stop or sanctions would be removed through notice-and-comment rulemaking determining that the State is implementing
the approved plan or part of a plan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Summary of Comments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters raise both practical and legal issues with respect to the proposal's sanction clock policy where it
indicates that EPA must fully approve SIP submittals before sanctions clocks that are started by disapprovals can
be stopped.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first commenter's practical concern is time. With respect to a sanctions clock started by a disapproval, because
of the length of the State's regulatory development, approval and adoption processes and EPA's review period, the
interpretation in the proposed rule could result in sanctions being imposed even if a State had fully adopted and submitted
the corrective rule. Sanctions would remain in effect until EPA finished its rulemaking approving the corrected
rule. The commenter is concerned that the rule could have an adverse impact solely because EPA had not had time to act
on SIP revisions that are fully approvable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter further believes that EPA's policy is not supported by the language of the Act. The commenter argues
that the Act elsewhere explicitly distinguishes between correcting the deficiency and EPA's process of approving
a SIP. Section 110(c)(1)(B) states that the Administrator must promulgate a Federal implementation plan (FIP) within
two years of SIP disapproval ``*&blank;*&blank;* unless the state corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator
approves the plan or plan revision *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Section 179(a), though, merely provides that sanctions
shall apply ``unless such deficiency has been corrected *&blank;*&blank;*'' and does not include the phrase regarding
EPA plan approval. The commenter believes that EPA cannot ignore the difference between sections 110 and 179 because
to do so would constitute ``reading out'' or rendering meaningless the additional phrase of section 110(c)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support its legal argument, the commenter states that principles of statutory construction provide that effect
must be given to each word in a statutory provision, and that every effort must be made to avoid an interpretation which
renders other provisions of the same statute inconsistent, meaningless, or superfluous (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
942 F.2d 1427, 1432 (9th Cir. 1991)). The commenter also notes that an agency cannot ignore or ``read out'' part of a
statute (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
822 F.2d 104, 113 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative to EPA's proposal, the commenter recommends that the sanctions clock policy for disapprovals follow
the process in the proposal for findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. The commenter states that under that
alternative policy the clock would be stopped if a new submittal is received, pending EPA's determination of whether
the deficiency has been corrected. The commenter urges EPA to adopt a consistent policy to stop sanction clocks in
all cases upon receiving a revised SIP submittal. If EPA's preliminary review indicates the deficiency has been corrected,
then the clock would remain stopped and EPA would proceed to approve the plan through rulemaking. If the deficiency
was not corrected initially, the clock would restart via a letter to the State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second commenter raised similar concerns with EPA's proposal that actual approval was needed to stop a sanctions
clock started by a disapproval. According to the commenter, the clock should be suspended with the submittal to EPA
of a completed rulemaking and remain suspended unless EPA disapproves the SIP. The commenter notes that EPA has the
opportunity to participate in the State's rulemaking process to ensure the deficiency is corrected.

(1) Overview of Change One. For the reasons stated in subsection (4) of this section II.B.3.c., EPA does not adopt the
exact approach set forth by the commenters, which would actually stop a sanctions clock started by a disapproval upon
State submittal of a SIP. However, EPA has determined that it is reasonable to temporarily defer and/or stay the application
of sanctions, as appropriate,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 following SIP disapprovals, where EPA proposes to fully approve a SIP revision or proposes to conditionally approve
a SIP.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition, EPA has determined that such deferral and/or staying of sanction application is reasonable following
findings of nonimplementation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 where EPA proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP. Simultaneous with such proposed approval or finding
of SIP implementation, EPA will issue a separate, interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency
that prompted the finding that started the sanctions clock. In all these cases, whether sanctions are deferred and/or
stayed depends on the timing of EPA's proposed action vis-a-vis the sanction clocks.

As discussed below under change two, the proposed sanction clock policy specifically provided for the deferral of
sanctions during completeness reviews of SIP's submitted following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings,
but not staying the sanctions. The concept set forth here for initial disapprovals and findings of failure to implement
is carried forth from this process developed in the proposal for initial findings of failure to submit or of incompleteness.
In carrying this concept over, EPA believes that it is logical and necessary that if the effect of sanction application
is to be deferred that sanctions actually applied should be stayed.

For initial SIP disapprovals where EPA subsequently fully approves the revised SIP, sanctions would be deferred
and/or stayed unless and until EPA's proposed full approval was reversed by a proposed disapproval or final disapproval
of the revised SIP in whole or in part. At that point, the interim final determination that the deficiency had been corrected
would be rescinded or reversed. For initial SIP disapprovals where EPA subsequently proposes to conditionally approve
the revised SIP, sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed unless and until EPA reverses its proposed conditional
approval by a proposed disapproval or final disapproval of the revised SIP in whole or in part. For initial SIP disapprovals
where EPA subsequently conditionally approves the revised SIP in final, sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed
unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval, or EPA proposes to disapprove in whole or in part
the revised SIP the State submits to fulfill the commitment in its conditionally-approved SIP.

On July, 9, 1992, EPA issued a policy that included a discussion of how conditional approvals convert to disapprovals
(see memorandum entitled ``Processing of State Implementation Plan (SIP) Submittals'' from John Calcagni to Air
Division Directors, Regions I&hyph;X, July 9, 1992). But note that, by this action, EPA is withdrawing the part of
the July 1992 guidance that addresses how conditional approvals convert to disapprovals. In the near future, EPA
intends to issue additional guidance to address this aspect of the conditional approval policy.

For initial findings of nonimplementation, sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed unless and until EPA reversed
its proposed finding that the State was implementing its SIP by proposing to find or finally finding that the State
was not implementing its SIP or by withdrawing its proposed finding that the State was implementing its SIP. At the
point of that subsequent action, the interim final determination that the State had corrected the deficiency would
be rescinded or reversed. (Exactly how the application of sanctions would be deferred and/or stayed following SIP
disapprovals and nonimplementation findings is discussed in greater detail below in this section. Change one is
reflected in the rule in &sect;52.31 (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4).)

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rationale for the deferring and staying of sanctions in these cases is that the proposed full or conditional approval
or proposed finding that the State is implementing its SIP would be the basis for EPA's interim final determination
that the State has corrected the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When EPA issues this proposal, the Agency indicates that it believes it is more likely than not that the State is complying
with the relevant requirements of the Act. The EPA believes it would be inequitable for sanctions to apply in situations
where EPA has made such an affirmative finding, even though it is only preliminary. Moreover, EPA believes it would
be unfair to apply sanctions merely because the clock had expired before EPA is able to take final action on the submittal
in these situations given the length of the rulemaking process.

(2) Overview of Change Two. The second change to the rule concerns the guidance discussed in the preamble to the proposed
rule at page 51273, footnote 9, where EPA indicated that if the sanction clock started by a finding of failure to submit
or incompleteness expires during a completeness review for a subsequent SIP submittal, the sanction would not apply
unless and until EPA found the submittal incomplete. In this instance, EPA intended that the sanction clock would
not temporarily stop, but instead would continue to run. During that time, EPA would simply defer the application
of the sanction while it reviewed the SIP submittal to determine whether or not the State had corrected the deficiency
prompting the finding. Thus, if and when EPA found the SIP incomplete after expiration of the 18-month clock, the sanction
would apply on the date EPA found the plan incomplete.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After further analysis of this aspect of the sanction clock policy in the context of addressing comments, EPA has determined
that it is inappropriate to defer and/or stay sanctions when sanction clocks elapse during review for completeness
of plans submitted by States following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. Therefore, EPA's rule provides
that the temporary deferral and staying of the application of sanctions occurs only when EPA takes an affirmative
action in which it indicates the Agency's belief that the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding
(e.g., that the State has corrected the finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness). The EPA believes this change
is necessary since, upon further reflection, EPA realizes that in such a situation there has been no prior affirmative
action by EPA preliminarily or finally determining that the State has, in fact, corrected the deficiency. A proposed
approval of a revised SIP following a disapproval constitutes such an action as does a proposed finding that a State
is implementing its SIP following a finding of nonimplementation. However, mere EPA receipt of a SIP submittal from
a State following a nonsubmittal or incompleteness finding does not constitute such an action, since EPA takes no
affirmative action preliminarily indicating that the State has submitted a complete SIP, and there is nothing to
give rise to an interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this change, sanctions will apply if a sanction clock expires during a completeness review of a SIP submitted
following a nonsubmittal or incompleteness finding. An example illustrates the implications of this change. Suppose
EPA finds that a State failed to submit a SIP and then at month 17 the State submits a SIP which the Agency then starts reviewing
for completeness. Month 18 arrives and EPA is still reviewing the submittal. Under the approach in the proposal, application
of the offset sanction at month 18 would be deferred unless and until EPA found the plan incomplete. Under the final
rule, the sanction will apply at month 18 and only be lifted once EPA takes affirmative action finding the plan complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For EPA to continue with the proposed policy of deferring sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings,
EPA would have to view mere receipt of a submittal from the State as a preliminary correction of the deficiency. However,
EPA's view is that receipt of a State plan does not constitute an affirmative EPA determination that the revised SIP
is complete.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
20
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, it is inappropriate to defer and/or stay sanctions following nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings.
Furthermore, once EPA has affirmatively determined the plan is complete, any sanctions clock or any applied sanctions
would be permanently stopped. Therefore, it is inappropriate to defer or stay sanctions following nonsubmittal
and incompleteness findings until EPA has affirmatively determined the plan is complete.

 The EPA believes this change, as well as change one, makes the Agency's approach in deferring and staying the application
of sanctions more consistent with the requirements of the Act.

Arguably, EPA could make an interim final determination that the State's submittal is complete. However, such an
interim determination is impractical and inappropriate for at least two reasons. One, the short time period provided
under the Act for EPA to make completeness determinations (i.e., 60 days) indicate that Congress did not intend for
EPA (nor contemplate for EPA) to make preliminary completeness determinations. Two, the nature of the completeness
review does not lend itself to EPA making preliminary and final determinations. The completeness review is intended
as a straightforward exercise to determine if the SIP revision includes the basic elements to warrant further review
for overall adequacy. Therefore, there is no room for a preliminary determination; any review sufficient to make
such a preliminary determination would be sufficient for EPA's final completeness determination.

A clarification is being made in the final rule which was not specifically addressed in the proposed rule. Following
nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings, the final rule effectively provides that sanction clocks can be stopped
(and sanctions lifted) only when EPA makes an affirmative completeness finding, and not when SIP's become complete
by operation of law pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(B) of the Act. This change is further discussed in section II.C.4.
below.

(3) Scenarios Illustrating First Change. The following five scenarios illustrate how sanctions can be deferred
and/or stayed following SIP disapprovals and nonimplementation findings.

Note that in the five cases discussed below in the ``scenarios illustrating first change,'' sanctions would apply
or reapply when a conditional approval converts to a disapproval just as they do when a proposed full approval is reversed
to a disapproval. Note also that, unlike full approvals, the mandatory sanctions process would not cease upon final
conditional approval. Following a disapproval, as indicated above, if EPA proposes full approval of the State's
revised plan, resulting in the deferral and/or staying of sanction application, and then takes final, full approval
action, the mandatory sanctions process ceases. However, if the scenario were one where EPA was conditionally approving
the plan, the final conditional approval does not stop the mandatory sanction process because it does not represent
EPA's final determination that the SIP is adequate. The EPA will make that determination when it reviews the revised
plan the State commits to submitting as part of the conditional approval. Ultimately, of course, if the State fulfills
its commitment and EPA approves the State's plan revision, then any sanction clocks are permanently stopped and no
sanctions are applied or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reapplied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, if, before month 18, EPA proposes to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is
implementing its SIP and that action is reversed 24 or more months after the finding, at which time the 18-month clock
has expired, application of the offset sanction is deferred until EPA's proposed approval or proposed finding that
the State is implementing its SIP is reversed.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For both types of findings, the offset sanction applies on the date EPA reverses its preliminary finding. Following
disapprovals, where EPA proposed to fully approve the SIP, the reversal would be either a proposed or final disapproval
in whole or in part, whichever occurs. Following disapprovals, where EPA proposes to or finally conditionally approves
the SIP, the reversal would occur as described in subsection (1) above of this section II.B.3.c. Following findings
of nonimplementation, the reversal would be either a proposed or final finding, whichever occurs, that the State
was not implementing its SIP. For both disapprovals and nonimplementation findings, the highway sanction applies
6 months from the date the offset sanction applies, unless EPA determines within that period that the State corrected
the deficiency prompting the finding. (This scenario is provided for in the rule in &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(i), (d)(3)(i),
and (d)(4)(i).)

This scenario assumes that EPA proposes approval prior to 18 months and that EPA's positive finding is reversed after
24 months. In that instance, after 24 months, only the 18-month clock has expired (and not the 6-month clock) because
the 6-month clock is not triggered until the offset sanction applies. (Section III.A. below discusses how the section
179 sanction clocks function.) Therefore, in this scenario, the 6-month clock does not start until EPA reverses its
positive finding after 24 months. The next paragraph and Figure 1 give an example of how this functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following discussion and Figure 1 provide an example of how this process functions with respect to a sanctions
clock started by an initial disapproval. The process would function in the same manner where the initial finding was
a finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA issues a SIP disapproval, initiating the section 179 sanction process.
Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP to EPA which EPA proposes to fully or conditionally approve, prior to 18
months from the date the sanctions clock started. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, making
a finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, the application of the offset sanction would be
deferred. Now suppose that, at month 25, EPA reverses its preliminary determination. The reversal would be a proposal
to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 25 (or, for final
actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction applies. The highway sanction then applies 6 months
later at month 31 (or, for final actions, shortly thereafter, as appropriate), if within that period EPA has not determined
that the State has corrected the deficiency.

Second, if EPA proposes (before expiration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18-month sanctions clock) to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing
its SIP and that proposal action is reversed before the 6-month clock expires that would have followed upon application
of the offset sanction, application of the offset sanction is deferred until such reversal of EPA's proposed finding.
The offset sanction applies on the date EPA's proposal finding is reversed (or, for final actions, on the action's
effective date). The highway sanction then applies 6 months later if EPA has not determined during that period that
the State has corrected the deficiency. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;&sect;52.31 (d)(2)(i),
(d)(3)(i) and (d)(4)(i).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The process would be the same for an initial disapproval. Suppose EPA makes a finding of nonimplementation, initiating
the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that EPA, prior to the end of the 18 month sanctions clock, proposes to find
that the State is implementing its approved SIP. At the time of the positive finding, EPA would simultaneously issue
an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this case, the application of the offset sanction would be deferred unless and until EPA reverses its proposed positive
finding. Now suppose that EPA, at month 22, reverses its proposed positive finding by withdrawing its proposed finding
that the State is implementing its SIP. At month 22 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset
sanction applies. The highway sanction then applies 6 months later at month 28 (or, for final actions, shortly thereafter,
as appropriate), if EPA has not determined that the State has corrected the deficiency.

Third, if EPA proposes (after month 18 but before expiration of the subsequent 6-month sanctions clock) to fully or
conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is implementing its SIP, application of the offset sanction
is stayed unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. (This scenario assumes that EPA's reversal
occurs before expiration of the 6-month sanction clock.) For both types of findings, the offset sanction reapplies
on the date EPA's preliminary positive determination is reversed. The highway sanction applies 6 months from the
date the offset sanction initially applied, if EPA has not determined that the State has corrected the deficiency
prompting the finding. (This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(4)(ii).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following discussion and Figure 3 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process
is the same where EPA has made an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA makes a SIP disapproval, initiating
the section 179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP which EPA, after 18 months but before
the subsequent 6-month clock expires, proposes to fully or conditionally approve. The EPA would simultaneously
issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency. In that case, application of the
offset sanction would be stayed unless and until EPA's proposed approval is reversed. Now suppose that, at month 22,
EPA reverses its proposed approval. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final
disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 22 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset
sanction reapplies. The highway sanction then applies at month 24, 6 months after the offset sanction originally
applied, unless EPA determines that the State corrected the deficiency within that period.

Fourth, if EPA proposes (after month 18, but before the subsequent 6-month sanctions clock expires) to fully or conditionally
approve a plan or proposes to find that the State is implementing its SIP, and EPA does not take action reversing such
positive action until after the subsequent 6-month clock expires, application of the offset sanction is stayed and
application of the highway sanction is deferred unless and until EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed. The
offset sanction reapplies and the highway sanction applies on the date EPA's preliminary determination is reversed.
(This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;&sect;52.31(d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii) and (d)(4)(ii).)

The following discussion and Figure 4 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process

of the highway sanction deferred at the time EPA makes its positive finding. Now suppose that, at month 26, EPA reverses
its positive finding. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole or in part or a final disapproval
of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 26 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective date), the offset sanction
reapplies and the highway sanction applies.

Lastly, the rule also provides that, following a SIP disapproval or a finding of failure to implement, if EPA proposes
after both sanctions clocks have expired to fully or conditionally approve a plan or proposes to find that a State is
implementing its SIP, application of the offset and highway sanctions is stayed unless and until EPA's proposed positive
finding is reversed. The offset and highway sanctions reapply on the date EPA's preliminary determination is reversed.
(This scenario is provided for in the rule at &sect;52.31 (d)(2)(iii), (d)(3)(iii) and (d)(4)(iii).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The following discussion and Figure 5 provide an example of how this process functions for a SIP disapproval. The process
functions the same for an initial finding of failure to implement. Suppose EPA disapproves a SIP, initiating the section
179 sanction process. Suppose that the State submits a revised SIP which EPA, at 25 months, proposes to fully or conditionally
approve. The EPA would simultaneously issue an interim final rule, finding that the State has corrected the deficiency.
In that case, the application of both sanctions would be stayed on the date of the positive action. Now suppose that,
at month 30, EPA reverses its proposed positive finding. The reversal would be a proposal to disapprove the SIP in whole
or in part or a final disapproval of the SIP in whole or in part. At month 30 (or, for final actions, on the action's effective
date), both sanctions reapply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Legal Basis and Rationale for Change One. The EPA believes that its policy clarification is consistent with the
statutory language of section 179 and that it is a reasonable interpretation of that language. The EPA believes this
policy is consistent with the legal requirements of section 179 of the Act and section 553 of the APA. Section 179(a)
of the Act requires sanctions to apply 18 months after a deficiency finding ``unless such deficiency has been corrected
*&blank;*&blank;*,'' and requires that sanctions apply ``until the Administrator determines that the State has
come into compliance *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The EPA interprets this language to require that EPA make a determination
that the State has corrected the deficiency before permanently stopping the sanctions clock or lifting sanctions.
In the case of a clock started by a disapproval, such a determination would be represented by a final, full approval.
However, EPA does not believe that section 179(a) requires a final approval in order to defer or stay the application
of sanctions, since the statutory language speaks generally in terms of ``correcting'' deficiencies and ``determining''
compliance without explicitly linking those events to final approval actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding SIP disapprovals, EPA recognizes the first commenter's concern over timing and believes that this policy
clarification eliminates the potential for sanctions applying in an area when EPA has a submittal in house for which
EPA has determined that it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the deficiency that prompted the original
disapproval. Extending the approach for disapprovals to findings of nonimplementation also serves to avoid applying
sanctions when EPA has proposed that a State is implementing its approved SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, EPA believes it is consistent with section 179 to treat proposed full approvals following disapprovals
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as the basis for deferring or staying the application of sanctions, while not permanently stopping the sanctions
clock or permanently lifting sanctions. The EPA also believes it is consistent with section 179 for proposed and final
conditional approvals to be the basis for deferring and/or staying the application of sanctions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed full or conditional approval then forms the basis for EPA to issue an interim final determination, which
EPA would publish in a separate action in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contemporaneously with the proposed approval notice, that the State had corrected the deficiency and come into compliance
with the requirements of the Act.

 While this interim final determination would have the effect of deferring or staying sanctions, it would not have
the final effect of either approving the submitted SIP revision, or permanently stopping a sanctions clock or permanently
lifting sanctions. The interim final determination would be subject to notice and comment and would have effect only
until either EPA made a final determination that the deficiency was corrected at the time of a final approval of the
SIP revision, or EPA reversed its interim final determination at the time EPA reverses its proposed full or conditional
approval. If an EPA proposed full approval were reversed by a proposed disapproval, the Agency would publish a separate
action in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 withdrawing the interim final determination (that the State has corrected the deficiency) contemporaneously with
the notice of the proposed disapproval. If an EPA proposed approval were reversed by a final disapproval, EPA would
take final action finding that the deficiency has not been corrected in the final disapproval action. For an EPA proposed
conditional approval, a reversal could occur by a proposed or final disapproval. For an EPA final conditional approval,
a reversal would occur when the conditional approval converts to a disapproval through the State's failing to submit
a complete revised SIP to which it committed or by EPA's disapproval of the State's revised SIP.

In NRDC v. EPA, No. 92&hyph;1535, slip. op. at 18 (D.C. Cir. May 6, 1994), the Court struck down EPA's policy of conditionally
approving committal SIP's (i.e., SIP's consisting solely of a commitment). However, the Court provided that ``the
conditional approval mechanism was intended to provide EPA with an alternative to disapproving substantive, but
not entirely satisfactory, SIP's *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The EPA will issue conditional approvals consistent with
that Court's opinion.

Since a final conditional approval has the effect of continuing the staying and/or deferring of sanctions, upon final
conditional approval, EPA would not publish a second interim final determination that the State has corrected the
deficiency (see footnote 18).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that this approach is similar to the method courts traditionally use to grant interim equitable relief.
Courts may grant preliminary injunctions to parties that the court determines are likely to succeed on the merits
of their case, where there is no adequate legal remedy available, and where the public interest would not be served
in not granting the injunction. Such injunctions may typically last until the court has finally decided the merits
of the case, either for or against the party granted the injunction. Deferring or staying the application of sanctions
upon proposed approval of a SIP revision is analogous, in that an EPA proposed approval represents EPA's view that
it is more likely than not that the State has corrected the disapproval deficiency and come into compliance with the
requirements of the Act. Also, as SIP approval actions generally require notice-and-comment rulemaking before
they can become final, if a sanctions clock is due to expire after proposed approval but before the Agency can practicably
fulfill its notice and comment duties and grant final approval, there is no other ``remedy'' available to relieve
the State from the punishment of sanctions, even though it is probable that the State has corrected the deficiency.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, EPA does not believe, following proposed approvals, that it would be in the public interest for sanctions
to remain in effect, as at that point the Agency believes that there is nothing further that the State need do to come
into compliance, and thus there is no further need for the deterrent effect of sanctions. The EPA also believes that
in these situations it would be especially unfair to States to begin the application of sanctions where the only reason
the sanctions clock has not permanently stopped is that the Agency cannot complete its rulemaking process to finally
approve the SIP before sanctions apply. Finally, EPA notes that like the judicial preliminary injunction model,
this approach provides that upon reversal of EPA's preliminary assessment that the SIP revision is approvable, and
that, therefore, the deficiency has not been corrected, sanctions would be in effect as if the interim final determination
that the State had corrected the deficiency had never been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also believes that this approach is consistent with the requirements of section 553 of the APA. Generally,
under the APA, agency rulemaking affecting the rights of individuals must comply with certain minimum procedural
requirements, including publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and providing an opportunity for the public to submit written comments on the proposal, before the rulemaking can
have final effect. The EPA will not be providing an opportunity for public comment before those deferrals or stays
are effective. Consequently, EPA's approach may appear to conflict with the requirements of the APA. However, EPA
will provide an opportunity to comment on the proposed approval that was the basis for the interim final decision and
will provide an opportunity, after the fact, for the public to comment on the interim final decision. Thus, an opportunity
for comment will be provided before any sanctions clock is permanently stopped or any already applied sanctions are
permanently lifted. In the context of the SIP approval rulemaking, and with respect to the interim final rule, the
public would have an opportunity to comment on the appropriateness of EPA's interim determination that the State
had corrected the deficiency and on whether the State should remain subject to sanctions, even though the deferral
or stay is already effective. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for allowing such an interim final action stems from section 553(b)(B) of the APA which provides that the
notice and opportunity for comment requirements do not apply when the Agency finds that those procedures are ``impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' In the case of sanctions, EPA believes it would be both impracticable
and contrary to the public interest to have to propose and provide an opportunity to comment before any relief is provided
from the effect of sanctions. First, until EPA proposes approval of a SIP revision, the Agency's first step in determining
whether a State's SIP submittal meets the requirements of the Act, EPA is not in a position to propose that the State
has corrected the deficiency; thus, there is no point in the process before proposed approval at which EPA could propose
that the State has corrected the deficiency and provide an opportunity for meaningful public comment on the issue.
Second, as discussed above, EPA believes it would be unfair to the State and its citizens, and thus not in the public
interest, for sanctions to remain in effect following an EPA proposed approval, since at that point the Agency has
completed a thorough evaluation of the State's SIP revision and publicly stated its belief that the submittal is approvable
and that the State has corrected the deficiency, but due to the procedural requirements of the Act the Agency has not
yet been able to issue a final approval. The EPA believes sanctions coming into effect following proposed approvals
would unnecessarily risk potential dislocation in government programs and the marketplace. The EPA also believes
that the risk of an inappropriate deferral or stay would be comparatively small, given the limited scope and duration
deferrals and stays would have and given the rule's mechanism for making sanctions effective upon reversal of its
initial determination that the State had corrected the deficiency. Consequently, EPA believes that the ``good cause''
exception under the APA allows the Agency to dispense with notice and comment procedures before deferrals and stays
of sanctions become effective, and that it is thus appropriate to respond to the commenters with the approach adopted
in today's rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Responses to Other Comments. The EPA does not support the alternative proposed by the commenters that EPA temporarily
or permanently stop the sanction clocks started by disapprovals upon EPA receipt of a submittal that the State believes
corrects the deficiency.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA cannot determine whether the State has corrected the deficiency until it reviews the plan for adequacy. If
the sanction clock were temporarily or permanently stopped upon mere submission of a plan following any section 179(a)
disapproval (or finding of nonimplementation) and not started again until subsequent disapproval, mandatory sanctions
would then take that much longer to have the effect of encouraging State compliance and protecting air quality in the
area. Temporarily or permanently stopping the clock upon mere submission of a plan could result in abuse of the system
by States knowingly submitting SIP's that EPA cannot approve in order to defer the application of sanctions. By allowing
such abuses, such an approach would also be unfair to States which, despite a good faith effort at developing a corrective
rule, are unable to avert sanctions following disapproval. In sum, under the revised policy, the underlying requirement
for stopping the sanction clock is maintained: EPA must take final action to fully approve a submitted SIP revision
or find that a State is implementing its SIP in order to permanently stop the sanctions clock and permanently lift any
sanctions. As discussed above, EPA will defer and/or stay the application of sanctions when it proposes a positive
finding that forms the basis for EPA to determine through an interim final action that the deficiency has been corrected;
but in these cases EPA will not temporarily or permanently stop the underlying clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA also believes that its interpretation is legally supported under the Act. Generally, section 179 states that,
``*&blank;*&blank;* unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding, disapproval,
or determination *&blank;*&blank;*'' one of the sanctions shall apply, as selected by the Administrator. Section
110(c)(1) of the Act requires EPA to promulgate a FIP at any time within 2 years after the Administrator finds that a
State has not made a required submission or has made an incomplete submission, or disapproves a plan submission, ``unless
the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision, before the Administrator
promulgates such Federal implementation plan.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The running of the sanctions clock is tied to the particular deficiency at issue. For example, if the clock was triggered
by a finding of failure to submit or a finding of incompleteness, the clock will stop if EPA determines that the State
submits a complete plan; it is not also necessary for the plan to be actually approved to stop the clock. If the complete
submission is later disapproved, then a new 18-month clock will begin to run, as provided in section 179(a), and will
continue to run until that deficiency is corrected with an EPA approved plan. For the FIP clock, in addition to the deficiency
being corrected, section 110(c)(1) includes an additional criterion_EPA SIP approval_that must be satisfied for
EPA not to have to promulgate a FIP within 2 years of a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness. The explicit reference
to an approval as an added prerequisite_beyond ``correcting the deficiency''_ makes clear that, in the context of
failures to submit or submission of incomplete plans, plan approval is quite distinct from ``correcting the deficiency.''
Therefore, the Administrator's approval is distinct from ``correcting the deficiency'' for failure to submit and
incompleteness. Therefore, the fact that the ``SIP approval'' language is redundant for disapprovals, where SIP
approval is part of correcting the deficiency, does not render that clause superfluous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interpretation of the section 179 sanction clock does not ``read out'' the section 110(c) requirement, but rather
merely illustrates that following disapprovals what is necessary to stop the sanction and FIP clocks is the same:
EPA approval of the SIP. (See EPA's July 9, 1992 SIP processing guidance, page 10.) However, as discussed above, this
is not the case for sanction clocks started by a finding of failure to submit or a finding of incompleteness. There,
the State can correct the deficiency merely by submitting a SIP EPA finds complete. This would stop the sanctions clock.
In these situations, the additional step of EPA approval is required to stop the FIP clock, under the plain language
of section 110(c)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, EPA's interpretation of section 179(a) does not render the provisions of section 110(c)(1)(B) inconsistent,
meaningless or superfluous. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case cited by the commenter addressed a situation in which one word, ``promulgation,'' was argued by petitioners
to have the same meaning as another, ``approval'' (942 F.2d at 1342). The court rejected that argument because failing
to distinguish between the terms would have resulted either in a conflict between two subsections of the Clean Water
Act or made superfluous the use of ``approval'' in another subsection (Id). Here, EPA's interpretation of what is
required to correct a deficiency under section 179(a) does not conflict with the requirement for EPA approval to stop
a FIP clock. It logically follows that approval is implicitly required to correct a deficiency based on a disapproval,
since a State cannot be considered to have remedied the underlying flaw that led to a disapproval until EPA has determined
that the State's attempt to do so is approvable.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The explicit language in section 110(c)(1)(B) is necessary because FIP clocks also may be started by a finding of failure
to submit or SIP disapproval. Congress was explicitly providing that in both these instances EPA approval is required
to stop a FIP clock. Therefore, the reference in section 110(c) to the need for EPA approval still has meaning when the
initial failure was a failure to submit or an incompleteness finding. Thus, EPA's interpretation does not render
superfluous the explicit language in section 110(c)(1)(B).

As discussed above, EPA believes it is appropriate at the point of proposed approval to contemporaneously issue an
interim final determination that the State has corrected the deficiency for purposes of deferring or staying the
application of any sanctions that are due. Again, this interim final determination would be subject to the condition
that EPA grant final approval to the SIP, and would not have any final effect on the actual approval action. If the subsequent
condition is not met (i.e., if EPA's proposed approval is reversed by a proposed or final disapproval), from that point
on the interim final determination would have no effect and any sanctions required to be applied would be applied.

, 822 F.2d at 113). That case addressed a petitioner's attempt to ignore a specific condition of the Clean Water Act's
applicability provision, which the court viewed as an unacceptable method of construing statutes (Id). Here, rather
than disregarding the requirement that EPA approval is necessary to stop a FIP clock, EPA is interpreting section
179(a) to implicitly require that same element to be satisfied before a sanctions clock started for a disapproval
can be stopped. This in no way ignores the section 110(c)(1)(B) language for purposes of the FIP clock, nor represents
an attempt to interpret the Act such that the language of section 110(c)(1)(B) does not have full effect. As stated
above, the reference to EPA approval in that section still has meaning where the clock was started by a finding of failure
to submit or incompleteness.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) Comments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Another commenter believes that the final rule should provide for resetting the sanctions clock whenever a State
that had failed to submit a timely SIP submits one, even if the SIP is later found to be incomplete. The commenter notes
that section 179 provides for an 18-month period following one of four different types of findings of inadequate State
action before sanctions can be imposed. The commenter argues that EPA illegally shortens this period by combining
into one, two types of inadequate action under the same 18-month period, and that the final rule should provide for
separate clocks for each type of inadequate action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter is concerned that States may be tempted to view the 18-month sanctions clock as additional time
in which to meet a deadline. The commenter believes that Congress did not intend that States that failed to submit a
timely SIP and later submitted an inadequate SIP would have more time before facing sanctions than States that submitted
a complete but unapprovable SIP on time. While the commenter agrees with EPA's policy that incomplete submittals
cannot temporarily stop the sanctions clock, the commenter believes the overall policy rewards delay in completing
programs. The commenter believes that the final rule should state that only EPA approval of a final rule stops the clock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Responses.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, section 179 indicates that sanctions apply within certain timeframes, unless EPA determines that
the deficiency that prompted the finding starting the sanctions clock has been corrected within those timeframes.
Therefore, EPA believes the Act requires that sanction clocks stop for findings of failure to submit and findings
of incompleteness when EPA finds a subsequently submitted SIP complete (i.e., finds that the deficiency has been
corrected). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA disagrees that a clock started by a finding of failure to submit should stop based on a mere submittal that may
or may not be complete. The Act provides under section 110(k)(1)(C) that where the Administrator determines that
a plan is incomplete the State is treated as not having made the submission. Based on this, EPA believes that an affirmative
finding that a SIP is complete is necessary to cure a nonsubmittal or incompleteness deficiency and stop sanction
clocks initiated by such findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
30
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interpretation is further supported by the fact that a finding of failure to submit and incompleteness are provided
for under the same provision of sections 179(a)(1) and 179(a)(3)(A).

On the other hand, EPA does not believe that it is appropriate to allow only EPA approval to permanently stop the sanction
clock for all types of findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is conceivable that a State could abuse the system under the process established in the final rule by submitting
a complete but inadequate SIP at 17 months that stops a sanctions clock that started based on a finding of failure to
submit or a finding of incompleteness. Such an area could face sanctions later than the State that submitted a timely,
complete but unapprovable SIP. However, as discussed above, EPA believes the reference to ``such deficiency'' immediately
following the list of the types of deficiency findings in section 179(a) indicates that sanctions clocks will stop
if and when the State corrects the specific deficiency that prompted the finding. Consequently, the running and stopping
of the clock is tied to the particular deficiency at issue, and EPA believes that it lacks the statutory authority to
apply mandatory sanctions under section 179 upon those States that initially failed to make a submission (through
failure to submit or by virtue of an incomplete submission) but which have subsequently submitted a complete plan.
The submission of a complete plan is sufficient to stop a clock started for a failure to submit any or a complete plan
because at that point the State has corrected the specific earlier deficiency of not having submitted a complete plan.
Following this correction, the plain language of section 179 does not allow application of mandatory sanctions due
to the original deficiency, but if the complete submission is later disapproved, a new sanction clock will begin to
run and will continue to run until that specific deficiency is corrected.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA believes that overall its policy is consistent with the language of section 179 and rational in that it recognizes
that what the State must do to correct a deficiency relates directly to the nature of the finding, and that overall this
policy will encourage compliance with Act requirements.

Furthermore, it appears that the approach articulated by this commenter (i.e., that sanctions clocks and FIP clocks
are both stopped by EPA approval of a revised SIP) would present the problems recognized in reading out of section 110(c)(1)
the clause ``the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision'' (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Act contains due dates by which the State is required to submit certain SIP's. The EPA does not believe
that Congress established the 18-month period before mandatory sanctions must apply as a grace period in which States
have a legal right under section 179 to submit SIP's after the relevant statutory due date. In fact, EPA interprets
section 110(m) of the Act as providing EPA with the authority to ``*&blank;*&blank;* apply any of the sanctions listed
in section 179(b) at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding, disapproval, or determination
under *&blank;*&blank;* section 179(a) *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, EPA is not precluded from taking more
aggressive action than required under section 179 when States fail to correct deficient plans.

Lack of Good Faith Determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 179(a), both the offset and highway sanctions shall apply after 18 months if the Administrator finds
a lack of good faith on the part of the State. In the proposal at page 51274, EPA indicated that any finding of a lack of
good faith EPA makes under section 179(a) will be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believes that the final rule should define a ``lack of good faith'' and require application of both sanctions
as a default where it exists. The commenter believes that some situations may require fact specific judgment, while
others are so extreme that they presumptively prove the State has decided not to make a good faith effort at complying.
The commenter believes that EPA need not undertake notice-and-comment rulemaking with respect to findings of a lack
of good faith. Another commenter believes that the phrase ``if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith on the part
of the State'' is subjective and ambiguous and needs defining.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, EPA still believes findings of a lack of good faith under section 179(a) must be subject
to notice-and-comment since it is a discretionary action which requires exercise of a substantial degree of judgment
on EPA's part. The public should have an opportunity to comment on the basis for these actions. Further, EPA does not
yet have a policy on how to further define the Act's language, or when and where it plans to make findings of a lack of good
faith other than the case-by-case approach described above. The notice-and-comment rulemaking will provide an
opportunity for the public to comment on EPA's interpretation of a lack of good faith in each case-specific circumstance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sanction Timing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal at page 51272 indicated that since section 179(a) provides for automatic sanction application once
EPA has made the selection, under this sanction sequence rule sanctions will apply automatically in the order prescribed
herein in all instances in which sanctions are applied following findings under section 179(a) (1)&hyph;(4) that
EPA has already made or that EPA will make in the future, except when EPA takes a separate action to select a different
sequence of sanction application. However, the proposal indicated that where the sanction clock expires for any
findings before this action is final and effective and EPA has not taken independent sanction selection action, EPA
interprets section 179(a) to provide that sanctions shall not apply until EPA makes the sanction selection through
notice-and-comment rulemaking, such as this action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At page 51272 of the proposal EPA also indicated that EPA intends to notify States of the automatic sanctions by letter
and publish a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in which EPA amends the language of the rule to indicate areas subject to the applicable sanctions. The proposal provided
that if removal of sanctions is warranted, EPA would notify the State that sanctions are being removed and amend the
rule to reflect that.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believes that EPA's interpretation of section 179 is incorrect and that section 179 unambiguously
requires sanction application within 18 months of a finding. The commenter believes that Congress did not condition
EPA's mandatory sanction application duty on completion of notice-and-comment rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plain reading of section 179(a) is that sanctions, ``as selected by the Administrator,'' apply within certain
prescribed timeframes. The section does not provide any guidance to EPA on sanction application sequence. Given
this wide discretion, EPA believes that it is necessary for sanction selection to be subject to notice-and-comment
in order to provide for public comment. The EPA interprets the phrase ``as selected by the Administrator'' as words
of condition that must be met before mandatory sanctions apply. Indeed, EPA is undertaking this rulemaking to satisfy
the conditional duty so that sanctions may apply automatically when sanctions clocks expire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA is also conducting this rulemaking to eliminate the future need (except to reverse the sanction sequence)
for individual rulemakings for every finding with respect to part D requirements. The EPA believes in the long run
this action will facilitate smooth application of sanctions to encourage State compliance and protect air quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice and Comment for Nonsubmittal and Incompleteness Findings. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposal at page 51272, EPA's view was that notice-and-comment is not required for findings of failure to submit
because of insufficient time provided by the statute. Since EPA has less than 60 days to determine whether a State's
submittal is complete, and it is impossible to provide notice-and-comment in 60 days, EPA believes that Congress
clearly intended that EPA should not go through notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to making findings of failure
to submit. Additionally, EPA argued that even if EPA's findings of failure to submit were subject to APA rulemaking
procedures, EPA believed that the good cause exception to the rulemaking requirement applies (APA section 553(b)(B)).
Section 553(b)(B)of the APA provides that EPA need not provide notice and an opportunity for comment if EPA determines
that notice and comment are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' The EPA argued that
notice and comment for findings of failure to submit does not require any judgment on the part of EPA and, therefore,
is unnecessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter states that under the APA, burdens such as sanctions cannot be imposed without notice-and-comment.
The commenter argues that EPA provides no defense of its denial of public comment for findings of incompleteness and
cannot defend such denial for findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness. The commenter further argues the judgment
of whether a SIP meets the SIP completeness criteria is often debatable and discretionary. Therefore, the commenter
argues, the public should be able to comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter believes that EPA's proposal contradicts the spirit and letter of the notice-and-comment provisions
in the Act. The commenter argues the proposal is contradictory on when it allows for public comment in some instances
but not others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comments, EPA maintains that notice and comment is not necessary for findings of failure to submit
and incompleteness. The 60 days the Act provides EPA to determine whether a State submittal is complete does not provide
sufficient time to conduct notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to making findings of failure to submit or findings
of incompleteness. The EPA continues to believe that the impossibility of conducting notice-and-comment rulemaking
within the 60 days provided for completeness decisions is itself compelling evidence that Congress did not intend
such rulemaking. Additionally, EPA does not believe that notice and comment are necessary for findings of incompleteness
because section 110(k)(1)(B) does not specifically require it. By enacting section 110(k)(1) on completeness,
Congress was codifying an EPA practice created in late 1989 in which EPA did not provide notice-and-comment rulemaking
before making incompleteness findings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 By codifying that practice and by not specifically requiring anything more than the process EPA already established,
Congress appears to have adopted EPA's established process of making completeness determinations by letter. Moreover,
EPA does not believe that the completeness determination is highly discretionary, but instead is a straightforward
exercise to assure a State's submittal has all the basic elements to warrant further review for overall adequacy.

Note that in promulgating the completeness criteria, EPA noted that the purpose of the completeness procedure is
to ``keep incomplete packages out of the more extensive review system (i.e., rulemaking for approval), thereby saving
both EPA and the State valuable time'' (54 FR 2138, 2139 (January 19, 1989)). Therefore, requiring rulemaking action
to determine whether a SIP submittal is complete would defeat the purpose of the completeness criteria, which is to
allow for a quick rejection of those submittals that are ``essentially unreviewable'' (

Regarding the APA, EPA continues to believe that even if EPA's findings of failure to submit and incompleteness were
subject to rulemaking procedures under the APA, the good cause exception applies to such findings for the reasons
discussed above. It would not be practicable to subject every completeness review to notice and comment because of
the limited time afforded by the statute. It would also not be in the public's interest because it would impose a tremendous
burden on the Agency and divert resources from more important substantive SIP reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the consistency comment, EPA believes that it is adhering to the notice-and-comment provisions of the
amended Act and the APA. Where it is appropriate, because the determination requires EPA judgment, EPA provides for
notice and comment (i.e., for SIP disapprovals or findings of nonimplementation). Additionally, as EPA has done
via this action, when EPA makes a sanction selection notice and comment are also provided. On the other hand, as discussed
above, in other cases sufficient time does not exist to provide for notice and comment and the determinations themselves
require little, if any, judgment. Finally, as discussed in section II.C.3., the final rule does not cover findings
of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5) for part D SIP's (so-called SIP calls), which were covered by the
proposed rule, because of concerns about adequate notice and comment before sanctions are applied for State failure
to respond to a SIP call. The EPA intends to develop an alternative approach for applying mandatory sanctions for State
failure to respond to SIP calls that provides for notice and comment.

PM&hyph;10 Waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposal did not address the PM&hyph;10 waiver provisions in section 188(f) of the Act. The commenter expresses
a frustration with the definition of PM&hyph;10 ``significance'' and argues that in the West, PM&hyph;10 levels
above the standard are caused predominately by fugitive dust and mobile sources. Therefore, the commenter believes,
applying 2-to-1 offsets to industrial sources will have a negligible effect on PM&hyph;10 24-hour concentrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A July 1992 draft addendum to the General Preamble (57 FR 31477, July 16, 1992) addresses several waiver policy issues,
including significance levels. The EPA believes the comment period for that policy, rather than this action selecting
sanctions, is the appropriate forum for comments on that issue. The EPA recognizes that in some nonattainment areas
industrial sources may be less significant contributors. In those cases, EPA may decide to apply the highway sanction
first, which this rule provides flexibility to do.

C. Summary of Changes in Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 52.31(a)_Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(a) sets forth the purpose of this rulemaking, which is to establish the sequence of sanctions required
to apply under section 179(a). The substance of this provision was not changed from the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 52.31(b)_Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(b) sets forth the definitions applicable under 40 CFR 52.31. The definitions of ``Act'' and ``1990
Amendments'' are not substantively changed. However, the citations for these two definitions were inadvertently
switched and they now correctly provide that the Act is located at 42 U.S.C. et seq. and the 1990 Amendments were set
forth in Public Law 101&hyph;549.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several definitions were added. Since the regulation provides that the offset sanction only applies
to the pollutant(s) that the finding concerns and its precursors, EPA has added a definition of ``precursors.'' The
EPA has also added a definition of ``ozone precursors'' which specifically identifies the two ozone precursors_VOC
and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has added a new definition for ``affected area.'' This term, while used in the proposed rule (e.g., the tables),
was not previously defined. Furthermore, its usage in the final rule has been expanded; in many places the word ``area''
has now been replaced by ``affected area.'' The definition provides that an ``affected area'' is the geographic area
subject to or covered by the Act requirement that is the subject of the finding and either, for purposes of the offset
and highway sanctions, is or is within an area designated nonattainment area pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7407(d) or, for
purposes of the offset sanction, is or is within an area otherwise subject to the emission offset requirements of 42
U.S.C. 7503. As used in this rule, in conjunction with &sect;52.31(e) (1) and (2), the affected area is the area potentially
subject to a sanction based on a finding. The new definition clarifies that the sanction applies to the geographic
area subject to or covered by the requirement at issue in the finding. This will usually be the entire designated area,
but in some instances may be a portion of a designated area. This point is made through the first portion of the definition.
Moreover, since the affected area is the area in which a sanction applies, it was necessary to limit the definition
to those areas that could be subject to a sanction. Therefore, the second portion of the definition restricts the definition
of ``affected area'' by incorporating the geographic limits of the highway and offset sanctions. First, the highway
sanction, as applied under section 179(a), is limited to nonattainment areas, since section 179(b)(1) provides
that the highway sanction may be ``applicable to a nonattainment area.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Second, by its terms, the offset sanction has effect only in those areas in which the offset requirements of section
173 are required to apply. (See 59 FR 1480 (January 11, 1994) for a further discussion of the geographic applicability
of section 179(b) sanctions.) This includes all nonattainment areas. In addition, some attainment and unclassified
areas (e.g., those located in the NOTR could be subject to the offset sanction, since those areas may be subject to the
offset requirements of section 173, even though they are not designated nonattainment (see section 184, for example).
Therefore, the second clause of the definition limits affected areas to nonattainment areas (which would be subject
to both the highway and offset sanction) and areas otherwise subject to the emission offset requirements of section
173 (which would be subject to the offset sanctions).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three examples illustrate how this definition applies. One, if EPA finds that a State fails to submit a PM&hyph;10
plan for a moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area pursuant to section 189(a) and the State does not correct the deficiency
within 18 months, then, pursuant to this rule, the offset sanction shall apply in the PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area
whose boundaries are described in 40 CFR part 81. If 6 months later the deficiency remains uncorrected, then the highway
sanction applies in the nonattainment area as well. In both cases the sanction applies only in the nonattainment area
because that is the geographic area covered by the Act requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two, if EPA finds a State fails to submit a required SIP revision under the Act for a requirement that applies to only
a portion of an area, then the sanctions apply to the portion of the area subject to the requirement and not the whole
area. For example, the enhanced inspection and maintenance plan requirement for serious, severe, and extreme nonattainment
areas applies only to ``each urbanized area (in the nonattainment area) as defined by the Bureau of the Census, with
a 1980 population of 200,000 or more'' (see section 182(c)(3)(A)). Section 184 provides that for all areas within
the NOTR, this requirement will apply to urbanized areas with a population in excess of 100,000. Therefore, this requirement
could apply to a smaller area within a designated nonattainment, attainment or unclassified area. If the State fails
to adopt the program for such an area, the section 179 sanctions would apply only to that smaller area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, if EPA finds that a State within the NOTR fails to submit a reasonably available control technology SIP for
VOC required pursuant to section 184(b)(1)(B) with respect to all the sources in the State subject to this requirement,
and the State does not correct the deficiency within 18 months, then, pursuant to this rule, the offset sanction would
apply in the entire State. If 6 months later the deficiency remained uncorrected, then the highway sanction would
apply to all of the nonattainment areas in the State. If there were no designated nonattainment areas within the State,
the highway sanction would not apply in that State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining definitions remain substantively unchanged from those in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 52.31(c)_Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(c) establishes the applicability of the final rule. The portions of &sect;52.31(c) setting forth
the findings that trigger the sanctions clock remain unchanged as these portions were taken directly from sections
179(a) (1)&hyph;(4). Generally, these findings are that a State has failed to submit a required SIP or SIP element,
has submitted a SIP or SIP element that does not meet EPA's completeness criteria, has submitted a SIP that is not approvable,
or that the State is failing to implement an approved SIP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portions of &sect;52.31(c) indicating the SIP requirements to which this rule applies have been modified. The
proposal indicated the rule covers any part D SIP or SIP revision required under the Act, or any part D SIP or SIP revision
required in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy under section 110(k)(5). This section of the final rule
has been modified to cover only part D SIP and SIP revisions and not calls for part D SIP's or SIP revisions under section
110(k)(5). The final rule does not cover part D SIP calls because of concerns about applying sanctions for State failures
to respond to such SIP calls following EPA nonsubmittal findings without opportunity for notice and comment. SIP
calls are currently not subject to notice-and-comment. The public and affected sources must be given notice and opportunity
to comment before SIP calls can have binding effect as a result of a section 179(a) finding that a State has failed to
submit a SIP in response to a SIP call. Thus, if this rule were to apply to State failures to respond to SIP calls, mandatory
sanctions could apply without an opportunity for such comment before new obligations become binding against affected
sources. This would be inconsistent with the APA requirements of section 553. Therefore, as discussed in section
II.C.3., the final rule does not cover part D SIP calls. The EPA will develop another approach to address SIP calls,
providing an opportunity for notice and comment before mandatory sanctions apply for a State failure to respond to
a SIP call.

4. Section 52.31(d)_Sanction Application Sequencing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(d)(1) is the heart of this rule in that it establishes the order in which the automatic sanctions under
section 179(a) shall apply. Several clarifications have been made to the section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One, this provision now requires affirmative EPA action to stop sanction clocks and lift sanctions following section
179(a) findings, including nonsubmittal and incompleteness findings. The EPA's proposed and final sanction clock
policy provides that, following findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness, sanction clocks are permanently
stopped (and any sanctions applied are permanently lifted) when EPA finds the plan complete. Section 110(k)(1)(B)
provides that a submittal is deemed complete if a completeness finding is not made by EPA within 6 months of EPA's receipt
of the plan. Under this clarification to &sect;52.31(d), a SIP becoming complete by operation of law will not be sufficient
to stop sanction clocks or for an area to avoid sanctions. The EPA will need to affirmatively determine that the SIP
is complete in order for the sanction clock to stop and any sanctions to be lifted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This policy clarification will henceforth govern what is required to stop sanctions clocks and lift sanctions following
findings of nonsubmittal and incompleteness, and the other section 179 findings. Prior to this policy clarification,
in certain cases EPA did stop sanction clocks started by EPA findings of failure to submit or incompleteness by SIP
submittals being deemed complete ``by operation of law.'' The EPA believes that this approach was consistent with
EPA guidance at the time and that it is appropriate to grandfather these areas under EPA's grandfathering guidance.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that after consideration of its grandfathering policy for SIP requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is permissible to grandfather these cases from this policy clarification. The EPA's general grandfathering guidance
provides that SIP revisions will remain subject to the requirements in effect on the date that the State adopts the
SIP revision, provided a complete, fully adopted SIP revision is submitted promptly, generally within 60 days of
the adoption. Since the policy clarification is effective by this action and all of the SIP submittals in question
were adopted more than 60 days prior to September 6, 1994, under this general grandfathering, these cases are grandfathered.
However, the guidance includes several exceptions to the general guidance which must be addressed before an action
is considered by EPA to be grandfathered.

See ``'Grandfathering' of Requirements for Pending SIP Revisions,'' memorandum from Gerald A. Emison to Air Division
Director, Regions I&hyph;X, June 27, 1988. This memorandum has been entered in the docket for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first exception concerns the intent of the policy not to grandfather SIP's submitted hurriedly to avoid new requirements.
In the cases at issue, such action has not occurred on the part of the State since the States have received no early, formal
notification that the sanction clock policy is being clarified in the manner it is today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second exception to general guidance on grandfathering concerns situations where a court ruling has explicitly
changed a current Federal requirement or has convinced EPA that a previous requirement is no longer supportable.
Here no such court ruling is at issue so no exception should be made in this case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third exception is that the Administrator may determine that grandfathering is not appropriate under a new policy.
In this case, the Administrator is determining that grandfathering is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fourth exception indicates that grandfathering is not appropriate if it would have an imminent and substantial
adverse environmental effect or could permanently foreclose use of part D provisions such as sanctions. The EPA does
not believe that grandfathering these areas from this policy clarification will have an imminent and substantial
environmental impact given the limited number of areas and given that the States' submittals must be adequate to attain
and maintain the relevant NAAQS before EPA can approve them. In addition, this grandfathering does not permanently
foreclose the application of sanctions in these areas should EPA, through rulemaking, find the SIP submittals inadequate
to attain and maintain the NAAQS and disapprove them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fifth exception provides that action on a SIP revision which comports with the revised requirements but not the
original requirements may be based on the revised requirements. In this instance, this is indeed the case; conceivably,
one or more of those SIP's deemed complete by operation of law may have lacked one or more of the elements needed for EPA
to find a plan affirmatively complete. Nonetheless, EPA cannot fully approve a plan if any of the required completeness
elements are lacking. For example, if a SIP submittal lacks compliance/enforcement strategies, one of technical
elements required for completeness, then EPA could not fully approve the plan. Therefore, while EPA is grandfathering
these SIP submittals from completeness, EPA is not grandfathering these areas from having adequate SIP's to attain
and maintain the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth exception raises a concern as to whether grandfathering the SIP from the requirements in question would
render the SIP as a whole substantially inadequate. Grandfathering these SIP submittals from this policy does not
raise direct concern that doing so might render the SIP's substantially inadequate since the completeness review
is not a review intended to pass judgement on the adequacy of SIP's. Rather, it is intended as a straightforward exercise
to determine whether the SIP's contain all the technical and administrative elements to warrant further review.
As discussed above, if any of these SIP submittals deemed complete by operation of law lack any such elements, then
such deficiency will be reflected in EPA's determination as to the SIP's adequacy to attain and maintain the air quality
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The seventh exception concerns certain classes of changes which are only indirectly related to attainment and maintenance
of the air quality standards. Completeness reviews are only indirectly related to attainment and maintenance of
the standards in that the completeness review is not intended to be review of the SIP's adequacy to meet the standards.
Therefore, the grandfathering of these SIP submittals from the policy clarification satisfies this exception as
well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two, the phrase ``affected area'' has been substituted for ``area.'' This is to clarify that the sanction only applies
in affected areas, and not necessarily all areas for which EPA makes a section 179(a) finding. (See the discussion
of ``affected area'' under the definitions section above.) Three, the second sentence regarding highway sanctions
has been clarified to provide that correction of the deficiency ``forming the basis of the finding'' is needed to stop
the clock. This language is consistent with the language included in the proposal section 52.31(d)(1) for the offset
sanction in sentence 1 and consistent with the interpretation established in the preamble to the proposed rule at
pages 51272&hyph;51273. This revision merely clarifies what deficiency needs to be corrected in order to stop the
sanctions clock.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, a new final sentence has been added to the section. The sentence provides that for clocks started by rulemaking
actions (i.e., disapprovals and findings of failure to implement), the date of the finding starting the clock is the
``effective date'' of the action, not necessarily the date it is signed or the date it is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Since the disapproval or finding of failure to implement is not effective until the ``effective date'' of the final
action, the sanctions clock should not start until such action is effective. Upon further reflection, EPA determined
that the clarification should be included in the rule in order to ensure that the public is adequately apprised of when
the sanctions clock has started for particular areas based on a rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has revised the final rule to add new sections &sect;&sect;52.31(d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4). In response to
comments, these sections incorporate a revision made to the rule concerning how and when sanctions, not yet applied,
may be deferred and sanctions, already applied, may be stayed. A complete discussion of the revisions is set forth
in section II.B.3. above. These corrections concern the circumstance where EPA has disapproved a required submittal
or where EPA has found that a State has failed to implement an approved SIP. Sections 52.31(d)(2) and 52.31(d)(3) set
forth language concerning disapproved SIP's and &sect;52.31(d)(4) sets forth the language regarding cases where
EPA has made a final finding of failure to implement. For purposes of an initial disapproval or an initial finding of
failure to implement for which EPA subsequently proposes a positive finding and issues an interim final rule finding
that the State has corrected the deficiency, any sanctions resulting from a clock that expires will be deferred and
any sanctions that have been applied will be stayed. (A final conditional approval would continue any stay or deferral
that resulted from a proposed conditional approval.) This change providing for a stay or deferral of sanctions does
not change the rule's requirement that sanctions and sanctions clocks are not permanently stopped until EPA issues
a final full approval or determination that a State is implementing its SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new &sect;52.31(d)(5) has been added which reaffirms what EPA actions are necessary for the mandatory sanctions
process to permanently cease. Specifically, it provides that any sanction clock will be permanently stopped and
sanctions applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming
the basis of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding of failure
to submit or incompleteness, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from EPA to the governor.
For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a SIP disapproval, a finding that the deficiency
has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 fully approving the revised SIP. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding
of nonimplementation, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur through a final notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 finding that the State is implementing the approved SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 52.31(d)(6) is essentially unchanged from &sect;52.31(d)(2) of the proposed rule. This section makes clear
that EPA may take rulemaking action in any specific circumstance to reverse the order in which sanctions will be applied
under section 179(a). In other words, EPA can take rulemaking action so that the highway sanction would apply after
18 months and the offset sanction 6 months thereafter. Two minor, nonsubstantive, changes were made. First, EPA replaced
the phrase ``the EPA'' with ``the Administrator.'' Second, EPA changed the term ``should'' to ``shall'' to more firmly
reflect the mandatory nature of the sanctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(e) sets forth the two sanctions that are applied by section 179(a). This rule, as did the proposed rule,
interprets in greater detail the offset sanction provided under section 179(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding &sect;52.31(e)(1), applicability of the offset sanction, there have been several changes that are intended
to more clearly capture the concepts in the proposed rule and the preamble to the proposed rule. The EPA has clarified
the applicability of the offset sanction to PM&hyph;10 precursors, modified the rule for PM&hyph;10 and ozone precursors,
and clarified the language in the rule regarding the pollutant applicability of the offset sanction when the SIP deficiency
in question is not specific to a pollutant or pollutants. A discussion of these changes in the context of the specific
sections follows.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has revised &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) in several ways. First, EPA has removed the offset sanction table from the
rule and decided to provide the public information on areas that will be potentially subject to sanctions in a separate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. As EPA makes clear elsewhere in this paragraph and the rule, the sanctions automatically apply in the timeframes
prescribed under &sect;52.31(d), unless EPA determines that the State has corrected the relevant SIP deficiency
forming the basis of the finding. The EPA never intended the inclusion of areas in a table in this rule to be necessary
for sanctions to apply automatically. The EPA does believe that it must provide the public with as accurate information
as possible on areas that may face sanctions and has elected to do so through notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than through a table in the body of the rule. Substantively, there is no difference in the sense that areas will
face sanctions in the timeframes prescribed under &sect;52.31(d) regardless of whether they are listed in a table
in the rule or listed in a separate notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, EPA has added the clause ``in the timeframe prescribed under &sect;52.31(d) of this section on those affected
areas subject under &sect;52.31(d) to the offset sanction of this section.'' As noted above, sanctions apply automatically
regardless of whether there is a table in the rule listing the areas subject to sanctions. Thus, this change was made
to make it clear that the sanctions apply within the time frames set forth in &sect;52.31(d). To further clarify this
point, a second change to proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) was to delete ``following'' in the clause referencing the
offset ratio for pollutants and their precursors. The reason for this change is because the table has been deleted
and thus no areas will be listed. The first sentence of &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) continues to require that the 2 to 1 offsets
be achieved for the pollutant or pollutants and any precursors for which the finding is made. (For further discussion
of this issue, see section II.B.2.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has added a second sentence to &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i). This sentence is partially derived from &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv)
of the proposed rule. The purpose of moving this sentence was to alleviate redundancy in the proposed rule. The first
sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) appeared to echo proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) by stating that offsets must be achieved for the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for
which the finding was made. Therefore, EPA has not included the first sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv)
in the final rule and has moved the second sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) to final &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i).
The sentence now located as the second sentence of &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) continues to provide that if the underlying
finding is not specific to one or more pollutants and their precursors, then the offset sanction shall apply to all
pollutants and, as relevant, their precursors for which the area is subject to the new source requirement of section
173 of the Act. (See section II.B.2. for further discussion of pollutant applicability of the offset sanction.) This
provision, of course, would apply to any area (nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified) that is the subject of
the finding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its entirety, then, &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) now provides: (1) That the emission offset sanction applies within
the time specified in &sect;52.31(d), even though the rule now contains no offset sanction table; (2) that the ratio
of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be 2:1; and (3) that the offset ratio shall apply to the one or more
pollutants and their precursors for which the &sect;52.31(c) finding was made or to all pollutants and their precursors
(for which the area is subject to the new source requirement of section 173 of the Act) if the finding was not pollutant
specific. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA has added new &sect;52.31(e)(1)(ii) to specifically address the issue of findings made with respect to ozone
and its two precursors, VOC and NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This was discussed generally in the preamble to the proposed rule at page 51276, footnote 18, although no specific
language was included in the proposed rule. The Act establishes requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, some
of which are specific for either VOC or NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, since the general assumption is that both precursors are critical to ozone formation, EPA believes that
even though a finding may be specific as to one ozone precursor, the offset sanction should apply for both precursors.
However, there are two exceptions to this general requirement, both of which are based on the Act. First, affected
areas that are designated nonattainment for ozone but that are not classified as marginal, moderate, serious, severe
or extreme, are not required to achieve offsets under section 173 for NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The second exception is for affected areas that have received a NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 exemption from the NSR requirement pursuant to section 182(f). These two exceptions and the rationale for them are
discussed in section II.B.2. above. A new &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iii) sets up a similar provision with respect to PM&hyph;10
precursors, which is also discussed in more detail in section II.B.2. above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 52.31(e)(1)(iv) of the final rule has merely been renumbered. Section 52.31(e)(1)(iii) of the proposed
rule previously contained these requirements and substantially remains unchanged. The preamble to the proposed
rule at page 51276 provides that this section requires States to apply the offset sanction consistent with amended
section 173, regardless of whether the State has approved NSR rules consistent with section 173 requirements. The
purpose of this provision is to ensure that States that have been delinquent in meeting the NSR requirements of the
amended Act are not benefitted by applying sanctions in accordance with NSR rules that are more lenient than required
by the Act or by the absence of NSR requirements within the State. Under this section, therefore, all affected areas
subject to the offset sanctions would be subject to similar requirements in achieving those offsets, as specified
in the amended Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 52.31(e)(1)(v) of this rule is unchanged from &sect;52.31(e)(1)(v) of the proposed rule. The purpose of
this provision is to establish when the increased offset requirement will be applied. As noted in section II.B.2.
above, EPA received numerous comments on this issue. For purposes of applying the offset sanction, EPA had some flexibility
in determining what permits would be subject to the increased offset requirement. As noted in section II.B.2., numerous
commenters suggested other possibilities. For example, some suggested that the increased offset ratio only apply
to permits for which an application was received after the date the offset sanction applied. As stated more fully in
the detailed response to comments document located in the docket, EPA has determined that the offset sanction should
have immediate effects in affected areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 52.31(e)(2) of the final rule sets forth the highway sanction. Several revisions have been made to this section.
As with &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i), EPA has removed the highway sanction table from &sect;52.31(e)(2) of the proposed
rule for the same reasons discussed above for why the offset sanction table was removed. Similarly, &sect;52.31(e)(2)
includes new language that directly refers to the timing provisions of &sect;52.31(d). As with the similar revised
language in &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i), this is merely to clarify that the highway sanction applies with respect to the
times set forth in that subsection, even though the area is not listed in a table in the rule. In addition, a new sentence
has been added which specifies that the highway sanction only applies to affected areas that are also nonattainment
areas. Although this issue was not specifically addressed in the proposed rule, the proposed rule and the preamble
to the proposed rule referred back to the section 179(b)(1) highway sanction requirement of the Act (58 FR 51274, 51279;
&sect;51.32(e)(2) of the proposed rule.) Section 179(b)(1) states that ``[t]he Administrator may impose a prohibition,
applicable to a nonattainment area *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, EPA is incorporating this language, which
was merely referenced in the proposed rule, into the final rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179(a) provides that unless the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., nonsubmittal, disapproval, and
nonimplementation) has been corrected within the time periods prescribed therein one of the sanctions in section
179(b) ``shall apply, as selected by the Administrator.'' Under this final rule, sanctions will apply automatically
in the sequence prescribed herein in all instances in which mandatory sanctions are applied under section 179(a)
following findings under section 179(a)(1)&hyph;(4) for part D plans or plan revisions that EPA has already made
or that EPA will make in the future, except when EPA takes a separate action to reverse the sanction sequence. However,
if the sanction clock has expired for any findings before September 6, 1994, no sanction has yet applied since EPA interprets
section 179(a) to provide that sanctions shall not apply until EPA makes the sanction selection through notice-and-comment
rulemaking. Since this action constitutes the final sanction selection rulemaking, the offset sanction begins
to apply on any areas for which the sanction clock has elapsed on September 6, 1994. To understand the timing of the application
of mandatory sanctions in these cases, it is first necessary to clarify the discussion in the proposal at p. 51274 on
how the sanction clocks function under section 179(a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 179(a) sets up two distinct sanction clocks. The Act states that if the State does not correct the deficiency
within 18 months after a finding, one of the two available sanctions shall apply, as selected by the Administrator.
It then provides that if the deficiency has not been corrected within 6 months thereafter, then both available sanctions
shall apply. The EPA interprets this to mean that the second sanction always follows 6 months from the actual application
of first, regardless of whether this would cause the application of the second sanction to be delayed beyond 24 months
from the date of the finding. Therefore, on September 6, 1994 the offset sanction shall apply on any area(s) for which
an 18-month sanction clock has elapsed and EPA has not determined that the State has not corrected the deficiency.
Both sanctions shall then apply 6 months from that date if EPA has not determined the deficiency has been corrected
by then. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EPA intends to notify States of the application and removal of section 179 mandatory sanctions (as provided for
in &sect;52.31(d) of this rule) before they apply. In addition, in its actions on submittals received after a section
179(a) finding, EPA will indicate what the effect of its action is on the sanctions clock and sanctions application.
The following discussion explains how this will occur, first providing the examples where, prior to 18 months, EPA
finally determines whether the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding, and then providing examples
where EPA finally determines the deficiency has been corrected after month 18. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the cases where, prior to 18 months, EPA completes its action determining that the State has corrected the section
179(a) deficiency, sanctions would not apply. The following two examples address instances in which EPA finally
determines within 18 months of the finding that started the sanctions clock whether the State has corrected the deficiency
and how EPA's action finding the State corrected the deficiency affects the sanction clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case where, within 18 months following a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness, EPA determines whether
a State's SIP submittal corrects the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., is complete or incomplete), EPA will
inform the State of whether the sanctions clock is stopped when it sends the completeness or incompleteness letter
to the State. If the SIP submittal is incomplete, then the letter will indicate that the sanctions clock continues
and that automatic sanctions will apply as prescribed by this rule. If the SIP submittal is complete, then the letter
will indicate that the sanctions clock started by the prior finding of failure to submit or incompleteness permanently
stops. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case where, within 18 months following a SIP disapproval or finding of nonimplementation, EPA determines whether
the State has corrected the deficiency prompting the finding (i.e., whether the SIP is approvable or whether the nonimplementation
deficiency has been corrected), EPA will indicate whether the sanctions clock is stopped when it takes final rulemaking
action on the SIP.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 action will indicate that the sanctions clock continues and that automatic sanctions will apply as prescribed by
this rule. If EPA finally approves the SIP or finally determines that the nonimplementation deficiency has been corrected,
then the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 action will indicate that the sanctions clock started by the prior disapproval or finding of nonimplementation permanently

As discussed above in section II.B.1., proposed approval (or a proposal that the nonimplementation deficiency had
been corrected) following a SIP disapproval or nonimplementation finding has the effect of deferring and/or staying
the application of sanctions. In this case, though, such proposal action would not have a deferral and/or staying
effect because it is assumed (for the purposes of this example) that EPA completes final rulemaking action on the SIP
within 18 months.

The following examples address how, following the section 179(a) findings, the States will be kept informed when
EPA's actions on revised SIP's are not completed within 18 months of the finding's deficiency. As provided in this
rule at &sect;52.31(d)(1) through (4), in explaining how the States will be kept informed, these examples address
sanction removal, as well as sanction deferral and staying.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In EPA interim final determinations that the State has corrected the deficiency, issued simultaneously with EPA
proposed approvals and proposed findings that States are implementing their SIP's (after EPA SIP disapprovals or
findings of nonimplementation), EPA intends to notify interested parties, including States, of any deferral or
staying of sanctions that will result from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 actions proposing to approve SIP's or to find that the State is implementing its SIP, as provided for in &sect;52.31(d)(2),
(3) and (4) of this rule. In these cases, EPA will also indicate to all interested parties whether sanctions are removed,
apply or reapply when it takes subsequent final action on the plan in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If subsequently EPA's proposed positive finding is reversed, then in that action EPA will indicate that sanctions
apply or reapply, as appropriate, and what sanctions, if any, apply subsequently. If EPA subsequently fully approves
the revised plan, then in that action EPA will indicate that the sanctions clock permanently stops and that any sanctions
previously applied due to the original disapproval or finding of failure to implement are removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these letters and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 actions, the EPA will also periodically publish notices in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

are likely to be subject to the offset and highway sanctions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
37
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If removal, staying, or deferral of sanctions is warranted, EPA will similarly provide the public with information
that sanctions have either been removed, stayed or deferred in the area. Finally, to supplement the various letters
and actions discussed above, EPA will provide information on the status of sanction 12 findings on EPA's Technology
Transfer Network (TTN).

In some cases, the letter and/or the action may be combined with another action relating to the submittal. For example,
if following a disapproval EPA proposes to approve a SIP at month 20 after the offset sanction is in place, the interim
final determination issued simultaneously with the proposed approval action would also serve to notify the public
that application of the offset sanction has been stayed.

B. Areas Potentially Subject to Sanctions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA has made section 179(a) findings of failure to submit and incompleteness for numerous submittals due under
the amended Act. As explained in section II.C.5 above, EPA has elected to provide the public with information on areas
potentially subject to sanctions in a separate notice that appears in the notice section of today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rather than in tables in today's rule. Therefore, for further information on areas likely to face sanctions on September
6, 1994 see that other notice.

IV. Miscellaneous

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (Order), (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory
action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements
of the Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory actions'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interface with an action taken or planned
by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs
or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel or policy issues arising out of legal mandates,
the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of the Order, OMB has notified EPA that it considers this a ``significant regulatory action''
within the meaning of the Order. The EPA has submitted this action to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB
suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal includes a discussion of the impact of the rule on small entities at pages 51277&hyph;8. The regulatory
flexibility analysis (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 600 et seq.) requires Federal agencies to identify potentially adverse impacts
of Federal regulations upon small entities. Agencies are required to perform an RFA where the significant impacts
are possible on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit
enterprises, and governmental entities with populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this action will have some impact, an initial RFA was prepared pursuant to EPA guidelines, which has been placed
in the docket to this rulemaking. For the following three reasons, EPA believes the impact of this rule on small entities
will be limited. First, any impact that may occur from the offset sanction is limited to sources defined as ``major''
for nonattainment NSR purposes, generally 100 tons per year (TPY) or more of a criteria pollutant, except in the more
serious ozone nonattainment areas. The major sources most likely to also be small entities as defined pursuant to
the RFA are in these more serious ozone areas where the major source TPY threshold has been lowered under part D of title
I of the Act. Second, the amended Act also increases the nonattainment NSR offset ratio in the ozone nonattainment
areas. The ratio ranges from 1.1-to-1 to 1.5-to-1, depending on the severity of the area's classification. Thus,
any impact the 2-to-1 offset sanction will have may not be as significant in precisely those ozone nonattainment areas
where small entities that are also major sources are most likely to exist. Third, as stated above, the only relevant
impact period is 6 months in duration, since after that period the State will either have become subject to both sanctions
or have corrected the deficiency and been relieved from any sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section II.B.1. of this document includes several comments concerning the impact of the proposed rule. One additional
comment is summarized here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter states that the lowering of the major source threshold under the Act exposes many more small sources
to control and the likelihood of sanctions. The commenter believes that many such small sources are small businesses
and that, contrary to the analysis in the proposal, an increase in the offset ratio of 0.5 could have a significant impact
on the ability of businesses to find adequate offsets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA believes that the final rule will have some impact on small entities. The lowering of the major source threshold
could expose more sources to the offset sanction. The EPA does not disagree that in individual cases an increase in
the offset ratio could have a significant impact on a small business. However, EPA believes that the impact of this
rule on small entities will be limited for the second and third reasons discussed above. Additionally, EPA notes that
the impact of this rule will also be lessened by the provision in final rules that provides for the deferral and/or staying
of the application of sanctions in certain instances when EPA believes it is more likely than not a deficiency has been
corrected (see discussion in section II.B.3. of this document). However, because this action will have some impact,
a final RFA has been prepared pursuant to EPA guidelines, which has been placed in the docket to this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain any information collection requirements which require OMB approval under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the offset sanction applies, sources subject to it will not incur an additional information collection burden
because sources are already required under the section 173 offset requirements to obtain an emission offset from
between 1-to-1 and 1.5-to-1. When the offset sanction applies, it should not impose an additional information collection
burden because sources will not have to provide any information in permit applications beyond that which is already
required in the absence of the sanction. (For the information collection burden of new requirements of the amended
Act for nonattainment NSR and prevention of significant deterioration, an information collection request is being
prepared to support rulemaking changes to parts 51 and 52.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the highway sanction applies, the Secretary of DOT is required to determine which projects or grants should not
be affected by the sanction and which, therefore, are exempt. This determination will be based on information readily
available in existing documentation gathered for the purpose of evaluating the environmental, social, and economic
impacts of different alternatives for transportation projects. These analyses are required for the preparation
of environmental assessments and impact statements under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), (42 U.S.C.
sec. 4321 et seq.). Historically, exemption determinations by DOT for sanctions have been based on such NEPA documentation
and have not necessitated additional information gathering and analysis by the States. In addition, since under
NEPA final environmental documents must be approved by DOT, in most cases the NEPA documentation will already be in
DOT's possession. Therefore, EPA does not believe that the highway sanction, when applied, will impose an additional
information collection burden on the States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section shall apply to any State in which an affected area is located and for which the Administrator has made one
of the following findings, with respect to any part D SIP or SIP revision required under the Act: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A finding that a State has failed, for an area designated nonattainment under 42 U.S.C. 7407(d), to submit a plan,
or to submit one or more of the elements (as determined by the Administrator) required by the provisions of the Act applicable
to such an area, or has failed to make a submission for such an area that satisfies the minimum criteria established
in relation to any such element under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A disapproval of a submission under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k), for an area designated nonattainment under 42 U.S.C. 7407(d),
based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the provisions of the Act applicable
to such an area; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3)(i) A determination that a State has failed to make any submission required under the Act, other than one described
under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, including an adequate maintenance plan, or has failed to make any
submission, required under the Act, other than one described under paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, that
satisfies the minimum criteria established in relation to such submission under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(1)(A); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A disapproval in whole or in part of a submission described under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A finding that any requirement of an approved plan (or approved part of a plan) is not being implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Sanction Application Sequencing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) To implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in an affected
area 18 months from the date when the Administrator makes a finding under paragraph (c) of this section unless the Administrator
affirmatively determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. To further implement
42 U.S.C. 7509(a), the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in an affected area 6 months
from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator affirmatively
determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. For the findings under paragraphs
(c)(2), (c)(3)(ii), and (c)(4) of this section, the date of the finding shall be the effective date as defined in the
final action triggering the sanctions clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the
findings under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct
the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to fully
or conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects
the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole
or in part. If the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under
paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of the date the Administrator issues
such a proposed or final disapproval, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway
sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section applies, unless the Administrator determines that the deficiency
forming the basis of the finding has been corrected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency
prompting the finding and after 18 but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to fully or
conditionally approve the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects
the deficiency prompting the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be deferred unless
and until the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove the plan in whole or in part. If the Administrator
issues such a proposed or final disapproval of the plan, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall reapply in the affected area on the date the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval. The highway
sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date
the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator
determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the proposed
or final disapproval occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1)
of this section.

the deficiency prompting the finding and the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has conditionally-approved
the revised plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting
the finding, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall be deferred unless and

under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date the approval becomes a disapproval
or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable. The highway sanction
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later of 6 months from the date the offset
sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected area, unless the Administrator determines
that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected, or immediately if the conditional approval
becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, whichever is applicable,
more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following the findings
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, if the State has submitted a revised plan to correct the deficiency
prompting the finding and after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has conditionally approved the revised
plan and has issued an interim final determination that the revised plan corrects the deficiency prompting the finding,
application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section and application of the highway sanction
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the conditional approval converts to a disapproval
or the Administrator proposes to or takes final action to disapprove in whole or in part the revised SIP the State submits
to fulfill its commitment in the conditionally-approved plan. If the conditional approval so becomes a disapproval
or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this
section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date
the conditional approval becomes a disapproval or the Administrator issues such a proposed or final disapproval,
whichever is applicable.

(4)(i) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if the Administrator, prior to 18 months from the finding, has proposed to
find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency
prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or
final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected
the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the
deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall apply in the affected area on the later
of the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation
has not been corrected, or 18 months following the finding that started the sanctions clock. The highway sanction
under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area 6 months after the date the offset sanction
under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applies, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines
that the deficiency forming the basis of the finding has been corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 18 months but before 24 months from the finding the Administrator
has proposed to find that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination
that the deficiency prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph
(e)(1) of this section shall be stayed and application of the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section
shall be deferred unless and until the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or
final finding, that the State is not implementing the approved plan and that, therefore, the State has not corrected
the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily or finally determines that the State has not corrected the
deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall reapply in the affected area on the date
the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation has
not been corrected. The highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall apply in the affected area on
the later of 6 months from the date the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section first applied in the affected
area, unless the Administrator preliminarily or finally determines that the deficiency forming the basis of the
finding has been corrected, or immediately if EPA's proposed or final action finding the deficiency has not been corrected
occurs more than 6 months after initial application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to further implement 42 U.S.C. 7509(a), following findings
under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, if after 24 months from the finding the Administrator has proposed to find
that the State is implementing the approved plan and has issued an interim final determination that the deficiency
prompting the finding has been corrected, application of the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall be stayed unless and until the Administrator
preliminarily or finally determines, through a proposed or final finding, that the State is not implementing the
approved plan, and that, therefore, the State has not corrected the deficiency. If the Administrator so preliminarily
or finally determines that the State has not corrected the deficiency, the offset sanction under paragraph (e)(1)
of this section and the highway sanction under paragraph (e)(2) of this section shall reapply in the affected area
on the date the Administrator proposes to take action or takes final action to find that the finding of nonimplementation
has not been corrected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Any sanction clock started by a finding under paragraph (c) of this section will be permanently stopped and sanctions
applied, stayed or deferred will be permanently lifted upon a final EPA finding that the deficiency forming the basis
of the finding has been corrected. For a sanctions clock and applied sanctions based on a finding under paragraphs
(c)(1) and (c)(3)(i) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur by letter from the
Administrator to the State governor. For a sanctions clock or applied, stayed or deferred sanctions based on a finding
under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a finding that the deficiency has been corrected will occur
through a final notice in the

(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, nothing in this section will prohibit the Administrator from
determining through notice-and-comment rulemaking that in specific circumstances the highway sanction, rather
than the offset sanction, shall apply 18 months after the Administrator makes one of the findings under paragraph
(c) of this section, and that the offset sanction, rather than the highway sanction, shall apply 6 months from the date
the highway sanction applies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) As further set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii)&hyph;(e)(1)(vi) of this section, the State shall apply the emissions
offset requirement in the timeframe prescribed under paragraph (d) of this section on those affected areas subject
under paragraph (d) of this section to the offset sanction. The State shall apply the emission offset requirements
in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 7503 and 7509(b)(2), at a ratio of at least two units of emission reductions for each unit
of increased emissions of the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding(s) under paragraph (c)
of this section is (are) made. If the deficiency prompting the finding under paragraph (c) of this section is not specific
to one or more particular pollutants and their precursors, the 2-to-1 ratio shall apply to all pollutants (and their
precursors) for which an affected area within the State listed in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section is required
to meet the offset requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7503.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding is made with respect to a requirement for
the criteria pollutant ozone or when the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions
offset requirements at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions for nitrogen oxides
where, under 42 U.S.C. 7511a(f), the Administrator has approved an NO

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, when a finding under paragraph (c) of this section is
made with respect to PM&hyph;10, or the finding is not pollutant-specific, the State shall not apply the emissions
offset requirements, at a ratio of at least 2-to-1 for emission reductions to increased emissions to PM&hyph;10 precursors
if the Administrator has determined under 42 U.S.C. 7513a(e) that major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors
do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the affected area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, at the 2-to-1 ratio required
under this section, the State shall comply with the provisions of a State-adopted new source review (NSR) program
that EPA has approved under 42 U.S.C. 7410(k)(3) as meeting the nonattainment area NSR requirements of 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515,
as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or, if no plan has been so approved, the State shall comply directly with the nonattainment
area NSR requirements specified in 42 U.S.C. 7501&hyph;7515, as amended by the 1990 Amendments, or cease issuing
permits to construct and operate major new or modified sources as defined in those requirements. For purposes of applying
the offset requirement under 42 U.S.C. 7503 where EPA has not fully approved a State's NSR program as meeting the requirements
of part D, the specifications of those provisions shall supersede any State requirement that is less stringent or
inconsistent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) For purposes of applying the emissions offset requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. 7503, any permit required pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. 7503 and issued on or after the date the offset sanction applies under paragraph (d) of this section shall
be subject to the enhanced 2-to-1 ratio under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 107(b) of the Americans with Disabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1990 (ADA) requires that the Department of Justice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the Department), the Equal Employment Opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission (the Commission or the EEOC), and the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue regulations setting forth procedures to coordinate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints that fall within the overlapping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of title I of the ADA and the Rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1973, to ensure that such complaints are dealt with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to this mandate, the Department of Justice and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC are publishing a joint final rule implementing section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
107(b) as it pertains to title I of the ADA and section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In addition, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation describes the existing procedures for processing: Employment complaints that fall within the overlapping

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of title II of the ADA and either title I or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or both; and employment complaints that arise solely under title I or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504. A joint final rule developed by the EEOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department of Labor implementing section 107(b) as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertains to title I and section 503 of the Rehabilitation

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12111&hyph;12117, prohibits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination against qualified individuals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities in all aspects of employment. Title I of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADA became effective on July 26, 1992, with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers with 25 or more employees. 42 U.S.C. 12111(5)(A). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 26, 1994, this coverage will be extended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers with 15 or more employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EEOC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized to investigate and attempt to resolve charges of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment discrimination under title I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle A of title II of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. 12131&hyph;12134, prohibits discrimination against qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals with disabilities on the basis of disability by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local governmental entities in their services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs, and activities, including employment. As of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 26, 1992, the effective date of title II, all State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and local governmental entities, regardless of the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons they employ, were prohibited from discriminating on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of disability in employment. The Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Justice has issued a regulation implementing title II, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that eight designated Federal agencies shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate and attempt to resolve complaints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination under title II. Complaints that arise solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title II are investigated by the designated agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most closely related to the functions exercised by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental component against which the complaint is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lodged. See 28 CFR part 35 (56 FR 35694, July 26, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended, 29 U.S.C. 794, prohibits discrimination on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of disability (formerly, ``handicap'') in programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities receiving Federal financial assistance or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted by any Executive agency. The nondiscrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of section 504 are applicable to employment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federally-assisted programs. Each Federal agency that

extends Federal financial assistance is responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with section 504 in the programs it funds. More

than twenty-five Federal agencies have issued regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing section 504 for their Federally-assisted

programs. These agencies are referred to in this rule as

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The substantive prohibitions and coverage of title I, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title II, and section 504 overlap to a significant extent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is, therefore, a potential for duplicative efforts by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the many Federal agencies responsible for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with these laws in their processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints. Thus, pursuant to section 107(b) of the ADA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department and the Commission are promulgating this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
joint final rule to establish procedures for coordinating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of complaints that fall within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlapping jurisdiction of section 504 and title I of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ADA. For convenience and clarity in processing complaints, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule also incorporates the provisions established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's title II rule at 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2)&hyph;(3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for coordinating the processing of complaints against public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities: (i) that fall within the jurisdiction of title II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and title I (but are not covered by section 504); and (ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are covered by title II, but not title I (whether or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not they are also covered by section 504). This reiteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of title II procedures does not amend or change the title II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation as previously published. The Commission does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
express an opinion on the title II procedures set forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herein, since they merely repeat a previously published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation over which the Commission has no direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. The Commission and the Department of Labor also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have published joint rules implementing section 107(b) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ADA as it pertains to title I and section 503 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act. See 29 CFR part 1641, 41 CFR part 60&hyph;742 (57 FR 2960, January 24, 1992).

Analysis of Comments and Revisions

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission received ten comments in response to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published jointly with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department of Justice on April 21, 1992. 57 FR 14630. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission received comments from various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected Federal agencies on both the proposed regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and on the draft final regulation, pursuant to interagency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination under Executive Order 12067. The Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the Department of Justice have carefully considered all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the comments and made various revisions in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. A number of commenters expressed reservations about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the feasibility of the procedures set forth in the NPRM and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested various alternative procedures. Several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters strongly urged that procedures similar to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in the regulation promulgated to coordinate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints of employment discrimination filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against recipients of federal financial assistance be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. See 28 CFR part 42; 29 CFR part 1691 (hereinafter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title VI/title VII regulation). The title VI/title VII 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation established procedures for handling complaints of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment discrimination filed against recipients of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal financial assistance subject to title VI of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1972, the State and Local Fiscal Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1972, as amended, and other provisions of Federal law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that prohibit discrimination on grounds of race, color, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
religion, sex, or national origin, in programs or activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving Federal financial assistance, when there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overlapping jurisdiction under title VII of the Civil Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1964. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the NPRM's ``first filed approach,'' the EEOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any section 504 agency with jurisdiction over a charge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint would process those charges or complaints that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were actually filed with it, pursuant to title I of the ADA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or section 504, respectively. In the case of a charge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint that was physically filed with both the EEOC and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agency with jurisdiction, the agency that first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received the complaint or charge would process it, absent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special circumstances, while the second agency would defer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing pending the conclusion of the first agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation. Numerous section 504 agencies expressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern about the practical difficulties inherent in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM's approach, including ascertaining which agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually received a charge or complaint first in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a charge or complaint filed with both the EEOC and a section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504 agency. Accordingly, as suggested by a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters, the final regulation adopts an approach similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that of the title VI/title VII regulation. Under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule, a complaint solely alleging employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination against a single individual (hereinafter, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual complaint) that is filed with a section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency with jurisdiction over the complaint will ordinarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be transferred to the EEOC for processing, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complainant specifically requests processing by the section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504 agency. Section 504 agencies, however, will retain for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing any complaints that allege: (i) a pattern or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of discrimination in employment; or (ii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination both in employment and in other services or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices of a respondent that are covered by section 504. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

.6, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM presented two options regarding the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to be applied by section 504 agencies, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble to the NPRM discussed the rationale for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option. Although numerous comments on these options were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in response to the NPRM, recent amendments to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act have resolved this issue. See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
506 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;569, 106 Stat. 4344. Therefore, as provided in
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment, the final regulation directs section 504 agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to apply the standards of title I of the ADA. See the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.12, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters also requested that time frames for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints be added to the final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because, in certain cases, individual agencies may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that preclude meeting fixed time frames for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain stages of the complaint investigation process, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggestion has not been adopted. For example, when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure of the complainant's identity is necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the investigation of a section 504 or title II complaint, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department requires receipt of a signed consent form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the complainant prior to notifying a respondent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department has received a complaint of discrimination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the final regulation retains the more general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that agencies act promptly and in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various commenters also noted the inefficiency of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that a section 504 agency refer a complaint to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Civil Rights Division for a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction when the agency does not have section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction, but does have title II jurisdiction. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response, the regulation has been revised to require that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint be referred to the Civil Rights Division only when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section 504 agency that initially receives the complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has neither section 504 nor title II jurisdiction.

.1 of the final rule, ``Purpose and application,'' explains that the rule establishes the coordination procedures
to be followed by the Federal agencies responsible for processing complaints of employment discrimination filed
against recipients of Federal financial assistance and arising under section 504 and title I of the ADA. In addition
to establishing those new procedures, the rule also restates and integrates into one comprehensive regulation those
provisions of the Department's existing title II regulation that established the procedures for coordinating the
processing of complaints covered by title II of the ADA and either title I or section 504, or both. The rule does not amend
the title II regulation, but simply locates all of the applicable regulations regarding coordination in a single
source.

program or activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, both of which relate to the determination of whether jurisdiction exists under section 504, have been revised from
those contained in the NPRM. The NPRM originally contained a detailed definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal financial assistance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, in recognition of the fact that this definition may vary among section 504 agency regulations due to the nature
of financial assistance provided by each agency, the new definition simply refers to the definitions adopted by each
section 504 agency in its regulation implementing section 504 for Federally-assisted programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
program or activity
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 under section 504 was modified by the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;259, 102 Stat. 29, for
all section 504 agencies. Therefore, to avoid any inconsistency between this rule and any agency regulations implementing
section 504 that may not have been amended to reflect this change to the Rehabilitation Act, the new definition references
the statutory definition.

Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 describes the basic procedures that section 504 agencies and the agencies designated to process complaints under
the Department's title II regulation will follow in determining whether to process an employment complaint or to
refer it to another agency. The primary purpose of the rule is to establish procedures for coordinating the processing
of complaints or charges of employment discrimination arising under section 504 and title I of the ADA. However, the
procedures for coordinating the processing of complaints or charges of employment discrimination against public
entities: (i) that fall under the jurisdiction of title II and title I (but not section 504); and (ii) that fall under
the jurisdiction of title II, but not title I (whether or not covered by section 504) established by &sect;35.171 of
the Department's title II regulation, have been restated here and integrated with the section 504 processing procedures
for clarity and ease in processing by the affected agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 has been revised to eliminate the requirement that the initial receiving agency, or the Civil Rights Division,
when a complaint is forwarded to it for a determination of jurisdiction, provide notice to the affected parties. As
previously written, the regulation required notification by any agency that came into contact with a complaint or
charge even if the complaint or charge was immediately forwarded to another agency. Instead of multiple notifications,
the final rule now provides for a more efficient single notification at such time as the appropriate processing agency
receives the complaint or charge, in accordance with agency policy and applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 has been revised to provide that, if an agency determines pursuant to paragraph (a) that it does not have jurisdiction
under section 504 or title II, and that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction under title I, the agency shall promptly
refer the complaint to the Civil Rights Division. This is a change from the procedure set forth in the NPRM, which required
a section 504 agency to refer all title II complaints to the Civil Rights Division. The revision was made in response
to various comments pointing out that this was an inefficient procedure when the section 504 agency was certain that
it was the designated agency under title II, and that the complaint would be referred back to it by the Civil Rights Division.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt of a referred complaint, the Civil Rights Division will determine whether another Federal agency may
have jurisdiction over the complaint under section 504 (that is, a Federal agency may be providing financial assistance
to the respondent) or under title II (that is, the entity that is the subject of the complaint may be a public entity).
When the Civil Rights Division finds such jurisdiction, it shall promptly refer the complaint to the appropriate
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 sets forth the circumstances under which an agency that is a section 504 agency, a designated agency, or both, will
promptly refer a complaint to the EEOC for investigation and processing. In addition to: (i) revising the regulation
to reflect the procedures of the title VI/title VII regulation (which generally results in individual complaints
being referred for processing to the EEOC); and (ii) incorporating the procedures already established by the title
II regulation, paragraph (c) and the balance of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 more specifically set forth the requirements for either referral or retention applicable to each type of agency.
Unlike the procedural scheme set forth in the NPRM, under which a complaint or charge could only be dual filed if it were
actually filed with both a section 504 agency and the EEOC, a complaint or charge filed with one agency will now be deemed
to be dual filed under both title I and section 504 under certain circumstances, as set forth in this section and in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(1) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.6 describes the rule applicable to an agency that receives a complaint of employment discrimination under section
504 or title II and determines that it does not have jurisdiction over the complaint. If the agency determines that
the EEOC may have jurisdiction, the agency is required to promptly forward the complaint to the EEOC for processing.
In certain instances this may require consultation with the EEOC. This paragraph establishes the requirements for
section 504 and other agencies and includes the requirements established by &sect;35.171(b)(2) of the title II regulation
with respect to designated agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(2) establishes the referral requirements applicable to section 504 agencies and requires a section
504 agency that otherwise has jurisdiction over a complaint of employment discrimination to refer the complaint
to the EEOC when the complaint solely alleges discrimination against an individual, unless the EEOC lacks jurisdiction
over the complaint under title I, or the complainant requests that the section 504 agency retain jurisdiction, either
independently, or following receipt of the notice letter described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(B).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The referral to the EEOC of complaints solely alleging employment discrimination against individuals is a significant
change in procedure from the NPRM. The revision was made in response to numerous comments urging this approach, which
is consistent with the title VI/title VII regulation. This approach will serve to minimize duplicative efforts because
the EEOC, in general, will be the primary agency investigating individual complaints of disability discrimination
in employment. An individual's private right of action under title I of the ADA will also be preserved under this approach,
since these section 504 complaints also will be deemed to be dual filed under title I. However, in order to preserve
an individual's right to have his or her complaint processed by the section 504 agency, paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) requires
the section 504 agency to retain the complaint for investigation if the complainant so requests.

Paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A) and (c)(2)(ii)(B) describe the notice letter a section 504 agency is required to send promptly
to each complainant before the agency refers a complaint solely alleging employment discrimination against an individual
to the EEOC. The purpose of the letter is to inform an individual who has initially filed his or her complaint with the
appropriate section 504 agency of the basic implications of a referral of that complaint to the EEOC. It is anticipated
that the vast majority of individual complaints will be referred to the EEOC, with the section 504 agency deferring
its review and processing until the conclusion of the EEOC's processing. However, because an automatic referral
to the EEOC of a complaint filed with a section 504 agency may be contrary to the complainant's expectations, complainants
will be given the choice of having the EEOC or the section 504 agency investigate the complaint.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each agency will develop its own letter informing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complainant that the agency will refer the complaint to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC for investigation and processing, unless the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives a written request to the contrary from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complainant within twenty days of the date of the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter. The agency notice letter shall explain: (i) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's procedures for processing section 504 complaints; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (ii) the EEOC's procedures for processing complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title I. The agency notice letter shall also inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals of the potential for differing remedies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(3) describes the procedure for referral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by designated agencies, as established by &sect;35.171(b)(2) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title II regulation. If a designated agency does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have section 504 jurisdiction, and determines that the EEOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have title I jurisdiction, it shall promptly refer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint to the EEOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4)(i) provides that complaints referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the EEOC by an agency with section 504 jurisdiction will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be deemed to be dual filed under both section 504 and title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. As a consequence, the section 504 agency, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to defer its processing of the complaint, will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an opportunity to review the EEOC's findings and take any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further action it deems appropriate, as provided in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4)(ii) further provides that a complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to the EEOC by an agency that has jurisdiction over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complaint under title II only (and not under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504) will be treated as a complaint filed under title I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only. See 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction between the treatment of these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of complaints, those falling within the province of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 and those arising only under the ADA, is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the ADA's statutory mandate to preserve the rights, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedies, and procedures of any Federal law that provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater or equal protection to individuals with disabilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than are afforded by the ADA. Permitting section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to review complaints originally filed with those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies preserves section 504 remedies, including an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's prerogative to terminate the federal funding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent. It is anticipated that the fact that fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
termination is ultimately available as an administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedy will encourage respondents to resolve valid claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through negotiation with the EEOC rather than through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litigation. Because &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10(c) requires the reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agency to give due weight to the EEOC's findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conclusions, it is also anticipated that, in most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, further action by the section 504 agency will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c)(4)(iii) states that any complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to the EEOC shall be processed pursuant to title I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. Specifically, the EEOC will notify respondents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its receipt of a complaint in accordance with its usual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for notification following receipt of a charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

.6 describes the circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under which an agency shall retain a complaint for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation (rather than referring it to the EEOC or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Civil Rights Division). The general rule applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agencies, as stated in paragraph (d)(1), is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a section 504 agency shall retain a complaint when it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that it has section 504 jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint and that any one or more of the following are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
true: (i) the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint; (ii) the EEOC has jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint, but the complainant requests that the complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be investigated by the agency rather than being referred; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the complaint alleges discrimination in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment and in other services or practices of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respondent that are covered by section 504; or (iv) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint alleges a pattern or practice of discrimination in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment. Such complaints will not be deemed dual filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title I of the ADA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This procedure is consistent with the approach taken in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title VI/title VII regulation. For reasons of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency, section 504 agencies will ordinarily process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints that allege disability discrimination in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment and other practices of a recipient, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC has no jurisdiction over the latter. Historically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under both section 504 and other civil rights statutes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies have also had a particular interest in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement of pattern or practice cases of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination against recipients of Federal assistance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies shall continue to investigate such complaints. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be noted that the term ``pattern or practice'' of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination is intended to mean systemic or class 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints generally. Although the term ``pattern or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice'' of discrimination is sometimes used in a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
narrow sense to refer to intentional discrimination or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disparate treatment on a classwide level, the term was used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the title VI/title VII rule to refer to both adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact cases and cases of intentional discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting a class of protected individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions described above only apply when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint is filed with a section 504 agency. The EEOC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always process all charges, including class charges, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are solely filed with the EEOC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d)(2) restates the principle established in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title II regulation that an agency shall retain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint for investigation when it determines that: (i) it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has jurisdiction over the complaint as a designated agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (ii) that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint under title I. See 28 CFR 35.171(b)(2).

.7 outlines the procedures that the EEOC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take in determining whether to process a charge or to refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it to another agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section .7(a)(1) requires the EEOC, as a first step, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the EEOC has jurisdiction, it shall process the charge in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with its customary title I procedures, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification of the respondent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a)(2) sets forth the procedures that apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the EEOC determines that it does not have jurisdiction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the charge. Under such circumstances, the charge will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be promptly forwarded to the Civil Rights Division for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral to the appropriate agency, or retention by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department for processing, as applicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(1) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.7 states the basic rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to charges filed with the EEOC, that is, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC determines that it has jurisdiction over the charge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under title I, it shall retain the charge. Because EEOC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of a charge filed with the EEOC is consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the charging party's expectations when filing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charge, no notice letter to the charging party, similar to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the letter required to be sent to complainants under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of &sect;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.6, is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b)(2) has been newly added to the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. It provides that the EEOC shall refer to a section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
504 agency for further action, as appropriate, any cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding against a recipient that has failed conciliation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the EEOC has declined to litigate. By providing for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency review under these circumstances, paragraph (b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should promote the ADA's statutory goal of preserving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 remedies, while the requirement that section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies give due weight to EEOC findings should eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any need for duplicative agency action.

and section 504 agencies shall follow in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints or charges of employment discrimination that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been dual filed with both the EEOC and a section 504 agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.8 sets forth the procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to complaints or charges of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination that are dual filed with both a section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency and the EEOC, both of which have jurisdiction over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the complaint or charge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under those circumstances, the rule follows the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pattern established by the title VI/title VII regulation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and requires the EEOC to process charges that solely allege 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment discrimination against an individual when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual has not elected section 504 agency processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 agencies will process all complaints that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allege: (i) discrimination in both employment and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices or services of the respondent; (ii) a pattern or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of employment discrimination; or (iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination solely against an individual, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual has elected section 504 agency processing. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocation of responsibility for complaint processing is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same as the allocation of responsibility for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints originally filed solely with a section 504 agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.8 sets forth exceptions to this general scheme for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
special circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) requires complaints or charges to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to the Civil Rights Division if both the EEOC and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section 504 agency determine that they do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction over the complaint or charge. The Civil Rights 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Division is then responsible for making the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral to a section 504 or designated agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) requires the EEOC and each agency with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction under section 504 to develop procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether complaints or charges of discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been filed with the EEOC and with one or more agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the Department, the Commission, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the section 504 agencies will work together to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, such as a uniform filing form (or uniform portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a filing form) that will facilitate coordination in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing employment complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although some commenters requested that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures be stated in the final rule, it was decided that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this activity is more appropriately conducted at a sub-regulatory level, which will permit more flexibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing efficient procedures. In addition, because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule has been restructured to follow the title VI/title VII 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation rather than the ``first-filed'' approach, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less need to determine whether a complaint or charge has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been filed with more than one agency. For example, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the title VI/title VII model, the EEOC will become the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary agency processing complaints or charges that solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allege discrimination against an individual. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no need to determine whether these complaints or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges have been dual filed in order to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility for processing. In addition, the notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter required to be sent to section 504 complainants prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to such a referral should provide an efficient mechanism for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether a charge has also been filed with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEOC because it could be used to require complainants to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveal whether they had filed a complaint or charge with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another agency.

Paragraph (d) requires the agency that will process a dual-filed complaint or charge to notify all concerned parties
that the other agencies will be deferring their processing, and of the possibility of further action by such agencies
pursuant to &sect;&sect;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) establishes that, under certain special circumstances where deferral may be inappropriate, the agencies
involved may jointly agree to reallocate investigatory responsibilities. For example, if the section 504 agency
would normally process the complaint, but the agency does not receive information that another charge has been filed
with the EEOC until after an investigation has been started by the EEOC, this exception permits the agencies jointly
to decide that the EEOC should continue processing the charge and that the section 504 agency should defer further
action. This exception could also be used in connection with subsequent complaints or charges, such as allegations
of retaliation, related to the original complaint or charge. The special circumstances listed in paragraph (e) are
illustrative and agencies may agree to reallocate investigatory responsibilities under other appropriate circumstances.
In such circumstances a complaint or charge will be treated as a deferred complaint or charge with respect to any right
to review under &sect;&sect;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not anticipated that most aggrieved individuals will separately file with both a section 504 agency and the EEOC.
Since the substantive protections provided by title I and section 504 are now identical, an individual's rights against
discrimination on the basis of disability can be vindicated under either statute. However, an individual who files
a complaint with a section 504 agency alleging discrimination both in employment and services, a pattern or practice
of discrimination, or who requests section 504 processing, will not preserve a private right of action under title
I of the ADA, unless the individual also files a charge with the EEOC under title I of the ADA.

section 504. If another agency has sole jurisdiction over the complaint under either section 504 or title I (and the
complaint was actually filed with that agency under section 504 or title I), &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.9 requires the designated agency to forward the complaint to that agency. If a section 504 agency and the EEOC both
have jurisdiction over a complaint or charge of employment discrimination, the rule allocates complaint-processing
responsibility according to the established pattern of the title VI/title VII rule, that is, individual complaints
are forwarded to the EEOC and complaints alleging discrimination in both employment and in other practices or services
of the respondent or a pattern or practice of employment discrimination are forwarded to the section 504 agency with
jurisdiction.

.10 describes the steps that shall be taken when the EEOC processes a dual-filed complaint or charge (either an individual
complaint that is referred to the EEOC or a dual-filed complaint or charge that the EEOC processes) and a section 504
agency defers its investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the rule requires the section 504 agency to defer action until the EEOC resolves the complaint, paragraph
(a) outlines the different ways in which any title I charge may be resolved, including litigation by the EEOC. Although
the EEOC is the agency primarily responsible for the enforcement of title I, resolution by the Civil Rights Division
is also included under paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) because, under title I of the ADA, when there is a cause finding pursuant
to 29 CFR 1601.21, the Civil Rights Division has litigation authority for charges against State and local governments,
government agencies, and political subdivisions. See 29 CFR 1601.29. The Civil Rights Division is also responsible
for issuing right-to-sue letters in such cases. See 29 CFR 1601.28(d).

Paragraph (b) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10 provides that, upon resolution of the dual-filed complaint or charge, the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division shall
inform the section 504 agency of the resolution. Paragraph (d) provides that, upon written request by the section
504 agency, the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division shall provide the section 504 agency with the materials necessary
to evaluate its resolution of the case, such as investigative reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.10 provides that, upon receipt of notification from the EEOC or the Civil Rights Division, as appropriate, the section
504 agency shall determine what further action is warranted. Because, pursuant to the 1992 amendments to the Rehabilitation
Act, the substantive standards to be applied to complaints of employment discrimination are now identical, it is
anticipated that, except in rare circumstances, the section 504 agency's findings and conclusions as to whether
a violation has occurred will be consistent with those of the EEOC and those of the Civil Rights Division, as applicable.
In order to further promote consistency and avoid duplication of effort, the rule requires that the section 504 agency
accord due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC and the Civil Rights Division, as applicable. The term
``due weight'' is adopted from the title VI/title VII regulation, which is referenced in section 107(b) of the ADA.
28 CFR part 42, subpart H; 29 CFR part 1691. In giving due weight to the findings and conclusions of the EEOC or the Civil
Rights Division, a section 504 agency shall give such full and careful consideration to the findings and conclusions
as is appropriate, taking into account such factors as: (i) the extent to which the underlying investigation is complete
and the evidence supports the findings and conclusions; (ii) the nature and results of any subsequent proceedings;
(iii) the extent to which the findings, conclusions and any actions taken under title I are consistent with the effective
enforcement of section 504; and (iv) the agency's responsibilities under section 504.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, if the agency proposes to take an action that is inconsistent with such findings and conclusions, the section
504 agency is required to provide written notification of the action that it proposes to take and the basis for that
action to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, the Chairman of the EEOC, and the head of the
EEOC office that processed the complaint or charge. This is intended to enable the agencies to identify and resolve
any potentially conflicting or inconsistent standards before they are imposed and to prevent duplication of effort.

What further action the section 504 agency will take will depend on the EEOC's (or, as appropriate, the Civil Rights
Division's) findings, conclusions, and resolution. This rule contemplates that in most cases the ``further action''
would be that the section 504 agency would notify the complainant and the respondent that it is closing its file based
upon the EEOC's resolution of the charge. For example, closure by the section 504 agency would be the appropriate action
when: (i) the EEOC found no cause and issued a right-to-sue letter, and the section 504 agency agreed with the determination
that no violation occurred; or (ii) the EEOC found cause and the violation was completely remedied through either
a conciliation agreement or litigation, and the section 504 agency agreed that the violation had been remedied.

action'' would be that the EEOC would notify the charging party and the respondent that it is closing its file based
upon the resolution of the complaint by the section 504 agency, and, where appropriate, would issue a right-to-sue
letter. For example, closure and issuance of a right-to-sue letter by the EEOC would be the appropriate action when
the section 504 agency found no violation and the EEOC agreed. Alternatively, closure alone would be appropriate
when the section 504 agency found a violation and the EEOC agreed that the violation was completely remedied through
either a conciliation agreement, an administrative hearing, or judicial enforcement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, this section addressed the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by section 107(b) of the ADA to ``[prevent] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same requirements under [title I and section 504].'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted earlier, in order to comply with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory mandate, the NPRM presented two options for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal standard to be applied by section 504 agencies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their investigation of complaints that are also subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
title I, and requested comment as to the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. However, in the period between the publication of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPRM and the publication of this final rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act was specifically amended to provide that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standards of title I of the ADA and the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the ADA, as such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections relate to employment, shall be the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied by section 504 agencies in investigating complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of employment discrimination. See section 506 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;569, 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section has been newly added to the final rule, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow maximum flexibility for the development of agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific memoranda of understanding (MOU) that would further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serve to minimize duplication of effort and fully preserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an aggrieved individual's rights under both statutes. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a section 504 agency amends its regulations to make them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with title I of the ADA, the EEOC and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual section 504 agency may enter into an MOU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the investigation and processing by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 504 agency of complaints or charges dual filed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both section 504 and title I of the ADA by the section 504 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. Execution of an MOU would be discretionary on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of both the EEOC and the particular section 504 agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 504 agencies that amend their regulations to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them consistent with title I standards would have, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement with the EEOC, the option of acting as the EEOC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agent for investigating and processing under title I all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaints covered by both title I and section 504 that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filed with the section 504 agency. It is contemplated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the terms of the MOU would be similar to the joint rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing section 107(b) as it pertains to section 503 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This final rule has been drafted in accordance with

Executive Order 12866, section 1(b), Principles of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation. The Department of Justice and the Equal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employment Opportunity Commission have determined that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12866, section 3(f), Regulatory Planning and Review, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordingly this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12875 prohibits executive departments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and agencies from promulgating any regulation that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by statute and that creates a mandate upon a state, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local, or tribal government unless certain conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. Although the procedures for processing complaints or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charges of employment discrimination established by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation may affect complaints or charges of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrimination filed against such entities, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not create any mandates affecting such entities and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may, in fact, reduce any current burden by streamlining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of complaints and charges at the Federal level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General and the Chairman of the EEOC have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed this regulation in accordance with the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), and by approving it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify that this regulation will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule does not establish reporting or record-keeping requirements that are considered to be information

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements as that term is defined by the

unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The section 504 agency determines that the EEOC does not have jurisdiction over the complaint under title I; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

its intention to make such a referral. The notice letter shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Inform the complainant that, unless the agency receives a written request from the complainant within twenty
days of the date of the notice letter requesting that the agency retain the complaint for investigation, the agency
will forward the complaint to the EEOC for investigation and processing; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

If the EEOC determines that it does not have jurisdiction under title I, and the section 504 agency determines that
it does not have jurisdiction under section 504 or title II, the complaint or charge shall be promptly referred to the
Civil Rights Division. The Civil Rights Division shall determine if another Federal agency may have jurisdiction

When special circumstances make deferral as provided in this section inappropriate, the EEOC, and an agency with
investigative authority under section 504, may jointly determine to reallocate investigative responsibilities.
Special circumstances include, but are not limited to, cases in which the EEOC has already commenced its investigation
at the time that the agency discovers that the complaint or charge is a dual-filed complaint or charge in which the complainant
has elected section 504 processing, alleged discrimination in both employment and in other practices or services
of the respondent, or alleged a pattern or practice of employment discrimination.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule governs the circumstances under which attorneys employed by the Department of Justice (``Department'')
may communicate with persons known to be represented by counsel in the course of law enforcement investigations and
proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this rule is to impose a comprehensive, clear, and uniform set of regulations on the conduct of government
attorneys during criminal and civil investigations and enforcement proceedings. The rule is intended to ensure
that government attorneys adhere to the highest ethical standards, while eliminating the uncertainty and confusion
arising from the variety of interpretations of state rules, some of which have been incorporated as local court rules
in a number of federal district courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule establishes, prospectively, a general prohibition, subject to limited enumerated exceptions, against
contacts with ``represented parties'' without the consent of counsel. This prohibition derives from the American
Bar Association (``ABA'') Code of Professional Responsibility and its successor, the ABA Model Rules of Professional
Conduct. The rule, on the other hand, generally permits investigative contacts with ``represented persons'': that
is, individuals or organizations that are represented by counsel but that have not yet been named as defendants in
a civil or criminal enforcement proceeding or arrested as part of a criminal proceeding. However, the rule does not
permit contacts with represented persons without the consent of counsel for the purpose of negotiating plea agreements,
settlements, or other similar legal arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department intends to issue substantial additions to the United States Attorneys' Manual (``Manual'')
to provide additional direction to Department attorneys when they deal with represented individuals and organizations,
in order to accommodate more fully the principles and purposes underlying the state bar rules. Those provisions will
further restrict government attorneys when they contact targets of criminal or civil law enforcement investigations
who are known to be represented by counsel, and when they communicate with other represented persons.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule on the subject of communications with represented persons culminates a lengthy rulemaking process
in which a proposed rule on the same subject was issued three separate times for comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 10086 (Mar. 3, 1994); 58 FR 39976 (July 26, 1993); and 57 FR 54737 (Nov. 20, 1992). Comments received after the publication
in November 1992 and in July 1993 of earlier versions of the rule resulted in major substantive changes being made to
the rule. As a result, a new proposal reflecting these changes was published on March 3, 1994. During the most recent
comment period, the Department received many thoughtful comments from private attorneys, local bar organizations,
state courts, federal prosecutors, and others. The Department closely scrutinized all of these comments. After
considering those comments, the Depa
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rtment made several relatively minor amendments to the proposed rule. Therefore, the final rule remains in substantially
the same form as the proposed rule issued in March 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule reflects the Department's commitment to fostering ethical behavior consistent with the principles
informing DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility and Rule 4.2 of the Model Rules of Professional
Conduct, while setting forth clear and uniform national guidelines upon which government attorneys can rely in carrying
out their responsibilities to enforce federal laws. (The term ``attorney for the government'' is defined in paragraph
77.2(a), and where this phrase, or a variant of it, such as ``government attorney,'' is used elsewhere in this commentary,
it has the meaning set forth in paragraph 77.2(a), unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, and it is typically
used interchangeably with ``Department attorney.''). In essence, this regulation permits federal prosecutors
and agents to continue to conduct legitimate criminal and civil investigations against all individuals, whether
or not those persons are represented by counsel. It allows government attorneys to continue to make or direct undercover
or overt contacts with individuals and organizations represented by counsel for the purpose of developing factual
information up until the point at which they are arrested or charged with a crime or named as defendants in a civil law
enforcement action. However, the regulation generally does not permit federal prosecutors to attempt to negotiate
plea agreements, settlements, or similar arrangements with individuals represented by counsel without the consent
of their attorneys. This regulation also precludes, with certain narrow exceptions, any contacts with represented
parties after an arrest, indictment, or the filing of a complaint on the subject matter of the representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the Department plans to add provisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual that will set forth further
guidance. The Department intends to prohibit overt approaches by federal attorneys to represented targets of criminal
or civil enforcement proceedings without the consent of counsel, unless certain enumerated exceptions are met.
The planned provisions also will generally require that government attorneys receive approval from their supervisors
before communicating with any represented party or represented target. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since early in this century, the rules of professional conduct that govern attorneys have required that lawyers for
one party in a dispute communicate only through an adverse party's lawyer, rather than directly. DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1)
of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Disciplinary authorities in all 50 states and in the District of Columbia have adopted one of these rules, or a similar
prohibition. Underlying these rules is the recognition that when two parties in a legal proceeding are represented,
it is generally unfair for an attorney to circumvent opposing counsel and employ superior skills and legal training
to take advantage of the opposing party.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the courts have long recognized that government law enforcement agents must be allowed broad powers,
within constitutional limits, to investigate crime and civil violations of police and regulatory laws. These powers
properly include the authority to conduct undercover operations and to interview witnesses, potential suspects,
targets, and even those defendants who waive their right to remain silent. Although the Fifth and Sixth Amendments
significantly restrict contacts with defendants after their initial appearance before a judge or after indictment,
these constraints generally do not apply before a person has been taken into custody or charged in an adversary proceeding.
Sound policies support this substantial power of police to investigate. The general public, victims of crime, and
even potential suspects have a strong interest in vigorous inquiry by law enforcement officers before arrest or the
filing of charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As long as investigations were treated as within the province of the police alone, the traditional rule forbidding
counsel from directly contacting represented persons did not come into conflict with legitimate law enforcement
activities. In recent years, however, the Department of Justice has encouraged federal prosecutors to play a larger
role in preindictment, prearrest investigations. Some of this increased involvement stems from the wider use of
law enforcement techniques, such as electronic surveillance, which require the preparation of legal filings. Also,
complex white collar and organized crime investigations necessitate more intensive engagement of lawyers, who
present such cases to grand juries. Most important, greater participation of lawyers at the preindictment stage
of law enforcement has been regarded as helpful in assuring that police investigations comply with legal and ethical
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This extension of the traditional prosecutor's responsibility has been a salutary development. One by-product,
however, has been uncertainty about whether the traditional professional limitation on attorney contacts with
represented parties should be viewed as a restriction upon prosecutors engaged in investigations and, by extension,
the agents with whom they work. The overwhelming preponderance of federal appellate courts have held that the restriction
on contacts with represented persons does not apply at the preindictment investigation stage.

 at 839. By contrast, state courts and state bar organizations have varied widely in their interpretation of the scope
of the prohibition on contacts embodied in DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2, and their analogs. Some examples of the varying
interpretations are detailed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty about the scope and applicability of DR 7&hyph;104, Model Rule 4.2, and their state counterparts has
directly affected the investigative activities of agents, including Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement
Administration personnel, who work with prosecutors. The expansive application of these rules in some jurisdictions
may have the effect of blocking preindictment interviews or undercover operations that most courts have held permissible
under federal constitutional and statutory law. Additionally, the heightened threat of disciplinary action that
accompanies the expansive application of these rules has created a chilling effect on prosecutors responsible for
directing these legitimate investigative activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These problems are compounded when federal attorneys assigned to the same case are members of different state bars.
Under federal law, a Department attorney must be a member in good standing of a state bar, but he or she need not belong
to the bar in each state in which he or she is practicing for the government. Therefore, prosecution teams often comprise
attorneys admitted to different bars. The application of different state disciplinary rules to these individuals
creates uncertainty, confusion, and the possibility of unfairness. Indeed, one member of a two-member federal prosecution
team could receive a commendation for effective law enforcement while the other member, licensed in a different state,
might be subject to state discipline for the same conduct. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these circumstances, the Department has concluded that a compelling need exists that warrants a uniform
federal rule to reconcile the traditional rule against contacts with a represented party with the obligation of the
Department of Justice to enforce the law vigorously. Indeed, absent a uniform federal rule, prosecutors have been
moved on occasion to reduce their participation in the investigative phase of law enforcement so as to leave federal
agents unfettered by state disciplinary rules that were never intended to govern police behavior. Such a retreat
from the field by prosecutors serves neither efficiency nor the interest in elevating legal compliance and ethical
standards in all phases of law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the disciplinary rules themselves invite promulgation of a regulation such as this one. Nearly all
the states have adopted rules that include an ``authorized by law'' exception. This final rule, a duly promulgated
regulation, is intended to constitute ``law'' within the meaning of those exceptions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Department has long maintained, and continues to maintain, that it has the authority to exempt its attorneys
from the application of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and their state counterparts. Furthermore, the Department
maintains that whether, and to what extent, such prohibitions should apply to Department attorneys is a policy question.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Ethical Restraints of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility on Federal Criminal Investigations, 4B Op. O.L.C.
576, 577 (1980). In light of the fact that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have adopted some form of a prohibition
on contacts with represented parties, and in view of the long history of those rules, the Department believes that
its attorneys should adhere to the principles underlying those rules to the maximum extent possible, consistent
with the Department's law enforcement responsibilities. Therefore, even though the Department has the authority
to exempt its attorneys from the reach of these rules, the Department has decided not to implement a wholesale exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, this regulation attempts to reconcile the purposes underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 with effective
law enforcement. Recognizing the importance of the attorney-client relationship and the desirability that an individual
who is represented by counsel be fully advised by counsel before negotiating legal agreements, this regulation provides
that federal attorneys may not negotiate plea bargains, settlement agreements, immunity agreements, or similar
arrangements without the consent of the individual's attorney. There is a heightened risk in this context of the prosecutor's
superior legal training and specialized knowledge being used to the detriment of the untutored layperson. Thus,
the regulations comport with the principal purpose of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 by insisting that the individual's
attorney participate in these types of negotiations. Further, even when contacts are allowed, the regulation is
designed to minimize any intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. At the same time, this regulation does
permit direct contacts at the preindictment, prearrest investigative stage with any individual, whether or not
he or she is represented by counsel. The regulation is drafted to conform to the approach of most federal appellate
courts that have considered the matter. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., United States

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 498 U.S. 855 (1990), and other cases cited previously in connection with the discussion of preindictment contacts.
The Department believes that public policy and effective law enforcement would not be served if the simple act of retaining
an attorney could serve to exempt a person from lawful, court-approved investigative techniques. The Department
believes that it is inappropriate to alter investigative techniques based upon an individual's financial ability
to retain counsel before the point at which an indigent would be afforded court-appointed counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation and the planned changes to the United States Attorneys' Manual also will give effect to other important
aspects of the bar rules against contacts with represented parties. For example, the regulation precludes federal
attorneys from disparaging an individual's counsel or from attempting to gain access to attorney-client confidences
or lawful defense strategy. The guidelines that the Department intends to add to the Manual also will make clear that
once an individual is in a likely adversarial situation with the government and has retained an attorney to represent
himself or herself with respect to the particular subject matter under investigation, the government attorney must
take greater care before making any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts. While the regulation authorizes most communications before arrest, the planned Manual changes provide
that, as a matter of internal policy guidance, federal prosecutors generally should not make overt contacts with
represented targets of investigations. However, the planned Manual provisions permit overt contacts with a represented
target when initiated by the target; when necessary to prevent death or physical injury; when the relevant investigation
involves ongoing or additional crimes, or different crimes from that to which the representation relates; or when
a United States Attorney or an Assistant Attorney General expressly concludes, under all of the circumstances, that
the contact is needed for effective law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the regulation and planned Manual provisions also address when a government attorney may communicate with
an employee, officer, or director of a represented corporation or organization without the consent of counsel. The
regulation generally prohibits a government attorney from communicating with a current, high-level employee of
a represented organization who participates as a ``decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal
position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject matter'' once the organization has been named as a defendant
in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. Further, the contemplated Manual provisions would generally
prohibit contacts without the consent of counsel with controlling individuals of organizations that have not yet
been named as defendants but are targets of federal criminal or civil law enforcement investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule recognizes that state courts and disciplinary bodies generally play the primary role in regulating
the conduct of all attorneys, including those who work for the federal government. The Department also recognizes
that with respect to most matters, Department attorneys are subject to the bar rules and disciplinary proceedings
of the states in which they are licensed. However, the Department believes it must be the final arbiter of the scope
of policing with respect to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts involving federal prosecutors, subject to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. As noted above,
because of the expanded participation of federal prosecutors in preindictment investigations, and the trend of
state courts increasingly to apply DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 expansively against federal prosecutors, these
rules have affected and circumscribed the power of federal officials to carry out their legally mandated responsibilities.
This regulation provides that the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to determine these rules. Further,
the Department's rules are intended fully to preempt and supersede the application of state and local court rules
relating to contacts by Department of Justice attorneys when carrying out their federal law enforcement functions.
Only if the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney has willfully violated these new rules would that attorney
continue to be subject to the full measure of state disciplinary jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is confident that, taken together, this regulation, the planned Manual amendments, and this supplemental
information will promote the public interest in effective law enforcement in a manner that also conforms to the highest
standards of legal ethics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures established by this rule apply to conduct occurring after the rule's publication.

II. Rulemaking History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 22, 1992, the Department of Justice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a proposed rule regarding communications with represented persons. 57 FR 54737. By December 21, 1992, the close of
the comment period, the Department had received comments from 20 sources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department was concerned that not all interested parties had received sufficient opportunity to respond during
the initial comment period. Noting ``the complex and important nature of the rule to the criminal and civil justice
systems and the licenses and livelihoods of its attorneys,'' on July 26, 1993, the Department reissued the proposed
rule for an additional 30-day comment period. 58 FR 39976. The Department received 219 comments following this second
publication of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 3, 1994, the Department issued a new proposed rule governing the same subject matter for an additional 30-day
comment period. 59 FR 10086. In response to concerns raised by bar organizations, bar counsel, state and federal judges,
and others, that proposal reflected substantial changes from the earlier proposals. This publication of the proposed
rule was accompanied by the issuance of companion provisions that the Department intends to include in the United
States Attorneys' Manual, which set forth certain more restrictive policies with regard to overt investigatory
communications. The discussion that follows summarizes the issues that were raised in response to the Department's
latest publication of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Summary of Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the most recent comment period, which closed on April 4, 1994, timely comments were received from 31 sources,
including nine individuals, nine organizations, four state court judges, one federal court judge, five U.S. Attorney's
Offices, two Department of Justice components, and one other federal agency. Of the 31 comments received, nine comments
supported promulgation of the proposed rule, 20 comments opposed the rule, and two other comments failed to take any
definitive position on the proposed rule as a whole. As with previous versions of this rule, many writing in opposition
to the Department's proposal argued that it unfairly permits the Department to hold its attorneys to ethical rules
different from those that apply to all other attorneys. Other opponents of the proposed rule_most notably the ABA
and a special committee of the Conference of State Supreme Court Chief Justices_challenged the proposed rule on constitutional
and statutory grounds, arguing that the Department lacks authority to preempt state ethics rules or to supersede
local federal district court rules. Those writing in support of the proposal generally praised it for bringing certainty
and clear guidance to an area that previously has been unclear and disruptive of law enforcement functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered carefully each comment and appreciates the thoughtfulness reflected in them. The
Department's responses to those comments are discussed below, either in the ``General Comments'' section or in the
context of the particular section or paragraph to which they pertain as part of the ``Section-by-Section'' analysis.
All revisions adopted in the final rule are indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received on the following three general issues: (1) the need for the rule; (2) the constitutional and
statutory authority for the rule; and (3) the sufficiency of the rule's internal enforcement mechanisms. These general
comments essentially repeated comments received in response to previous versions of the proposed rule. After careful
reconsideration of these recurring issues, the Department's position on many of these subjects_in particular,
the constitutional and statutory basis for this rule and the need for and advisability of such a rule_remains the same.
Therefore, the Department's response in this section builds upon responses published in previous commentaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Need for the Rule.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One state court judge, one federal judge, five individuals, and six organizations criticized the proposed rule as
holding government attorneys to lower ethical standards than those that apply to all other attorneys. This comment
was formulated in a variety of ways, with the following as illustrative examples: ``[t]he rules apply to everyone,
and it should especially apply to attorneys in Government service;'' ``I do not know why it is that the department somehow
thinks [it] can exempt [its] attorneys from the rules of conduct that all of the lawyers must abide by;'' ``[Department]
lawyers should be treated as subject to the same rule of law that applies to the conduct of all other lawyers;'' and ``[f]airness
simply will not tolerate exalting the role of one adversary's advocate above the other.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, the Department finds it important, first, to make clear that this rule is not designed
to diminish the ethical responsibilities of government attorneys; it is intended to clarify those responsibilities.
The current situation, in which state contact rules purport to govern the substantive conduct of federal law enforcement
attorneys, has proven unsatisfactory because the standards of ethical conduct are uncertain and subject to unpredictable
and varying interpretations. This uncertainty as to what constitutes appropriate conduct by Department attorneys
has interfered with the responsible exercise of the law enforcement duties of Department attorneys. The basic purpose
of this regulation is to provide a uniform rule of ethics regarding contacts with represented persons that can be consistently
and predictably applied. By doing so, the regulation will allow all Department attorneys involved in a federal law
enforcement proceeding to understand and abide by applicable standards. There is simply no basis for believing that
there will be a reduction in compliance with ethical standards by federal prosecutors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters opposing the proposed rule dismissed as unnecessary the creation of a uniform set of rules for Department
attorneys. Some commented that the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contact rules currently in place do not vary significantly, given that virtually every jurisdiction has adopted
some version of the ABA's anti-contact rule. Other commenters argued that, in any event, state and local ethics rules
do not interfere substantially with federal law enforcement activities because only in rare instances have federal
prosecutors actually been investigated by a state disciplinary authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although an anti-contact rule is in effect in nearly all jurisdictions, it is not interpreted uniformly. Among other

 691 P.2d 564 (Wash. 1984). The lack of uniformity in interpreting existing anti-contact rules has created concern
among government attorneys of inadvertently running afoul of state court or federal district court rules. The threat
of disciplinary proceedings (and the possible resulting loss of license and livelihood) against a government attorney
engaged in legitimate law enforcement activities has had a chilling effect on the responsible exercise of law enforcement
duties. Many federal prosecutors who submitted comments in connection with the earlier versions of this rule stated
that they feel compelled to refrain from authorizing or participating in legitimate and ethical law enforcement
activities because of the current uncertainty as to the acceptability of various 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To add to the confusion inherent in the current situation, the Department's attorney staff consists of members of
many different state bars who commonly appear in multiple jurisdictions. Under the Model Rule's approach, an attorney
practicing in a jurisdiction in which he or she is not a member of the bar remains subject to the jurisdiction of the bar
of which he or she is a member, but if the rules in the two places differ, principles of conflict of laws may apply. Model
Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 8.5 and cmt. (1983). As a result, when state anti-contact rules purport to govern
the conduct of federal attorneys, the question of which rule governs the conduct of Department lawyers may often be
complicated. Indeed, as was noted in the ``Background'' section of this commentary, government attorneys may be
subject to substantially different rules when they are working alongside one another on the same case. One commenter
proposed that instead of issuing a uniform contacts rule for Department attorneys, the Department should encourage
its attorneys to practice only in a given jurisdiction and to obtain bar membership in that jurisdiction. However,
Congress has made clear that Department attorneys should be able to practice in different jurisdictions so long as
they are a member of some state bar, and there is a significant federal interest in preserving the Department's ability
to assign its attorneys wherever there are law enforcement needs to be met. This uniform rule regarding contacts with
represented persons achieves consistency and high ethical standards without hampering federal law enforcement
activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In formulating this uniform rule, the Department has not disregarded existing state ethics rules, as a number of comments
imply. As set forth in section 77.12, this regulation is specifically intended to fit within the structure of DR 7&hyph;104
and Model Rule 4.2, as well as analogous state and local district court disciplinary rules. Both DR 7&hyph;104 and
Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are exempted from the general prohibition
of the rule and, according to the Reporter for the commission that developed the Model Rules, Yale Law School ethics
professor Geoffrey Hazard, this exception was drafted with the ``government lawyer'' problem in mind.

 Letter of January 19, 1994 from Professor Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr. to Chief Justice E. Norman Veasey, at 2 (``I can state
from first-hand knowledge that this [authorized by law] qualification was drafted mindful of the government lawyer
problem, among others. In my opinion it is within the authority of the federal government, particularly the Justice
Department, to promulgate such regulations.'') (This letter and all comments are on file with the Office of the Associate
Attorney General, United States Department of Justice). As explained later in this commentary, the Department's
position is that communications with represented persons undertaken pursuant to this duly promulgated regulation
clearly constitute communications ``authorized by law.'' Therefore, in nearly all jurisdictions, communications
approved under the Department's rules will be appropriate under existing ethical rules as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the content of this rule derives largely from DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and is wholly consistent
with the principles underlying these rules. This regulation grants greater latitude for lawyer communications
with a represented ``person'' during the investigative phase of law enforcement than with a represented ``party''
after adversarial proceedings have commenced. This distinction appears in the texts of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule
4.2, which prohibit only communications with ``a party'' the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the
matter. This distinction also accords with the great weight of federal court interpretations of the state ethics
rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The courts have readily recognized that Department attorneys engaged in criminal and civil law enforcement matters
perform distinctly different functions from attorneys engaged in the private practice of law. The courts have further
recognized that the rules governing communications with represented persons should take account of these differences.
To disregard these differences would therefore impose substantial and deleterious restrictions on the legitimate
law enforcement duties of Department attorneys that do not presently exist.

For much the same reasons, the Department believes that there is a basis for distinguishing for purposes of this regulation
between Department attorneys engaged in law enforcement activities (who are covered by this regulation) and Department
attorneys engaged in civil suits in which the United States is not acting under its police or regulatory powers (who
are not covered). One commenter proposed extending these rules to cover also the latter activities of Department
attorneys; however, because government attorneys engaged in other, ordinary civil litigation are not engaged in
distinctly different functions from private attorneys involved in civil cases, they are not brought under this regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two organizations further criticized the Department for holding government attorneys to ethical standards no higher
than what the Constitution provides. The Department agrees that the constitutional baseline does not provide the
proper measure of government attorneys' ethical obligations. But this regulation does not purport to equate the
two standards. On the contrary, the Department's final rule imposes a range of restrictions that go beyond those that
are constitutionally compelled. For example, the regulation prohibits government attorneys generally from engaging
in negotiations of certain specified legal agreements with any represented individual without the consent of that
individual's counsel, even if that individual is not in custody and not formally charged. Such communications are
not constitutionally proscribed.

will place significant limits on the ability of government attorneys to engage in noncustodial communications with
a represented ``target'' of a federal criminal or civil law enforcement investigation, even though narrowing an
investigation to focus on a particular suspect does not trigger the suspect's right to counsel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual and a number of organizations, including the Conference of Chief Justices, posited that the Department
is acting outside the scope of its congressionally delegated authority because this regulation assertedly contravenes
the Department of Justice Appropriation Authorization Act of 1979, which requires all Department attorneys to be
``duly licensed and authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a State, territory, or the District of Columbia.''
Pub. Law No. 96&hyph;132, &sect;3(a), 93 Stat. 1040, 1044 (Nov. 30, 1979), as carried forward by Pub. Law No. 103&hyph;121,
107 Stat. 1153, 1163 (Oct. 27, 1993) (reenacting provisions of Pub. Law No. 96&hyph;132). These commenters suggested
that when Congress required Department attorneys to be licensed by a state bar, Congress implied that Department
attorneys should be subject to all the rules and regulations of state authorities, regardless of their impact on officials
carrying out federal law enforcement. Therefore, this regulation, by shielding Department attorneys from state
disciplinary proceedings for violations of state rules interfering with effective federal law enforcement, is
alleged to violate Congress's clear intent in enacting the Department's appropriation statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department believes that these comments mistake the purpose and effect of the congressional requirement that
federal attorneys have state licenses. That requirement, which is satisfied by admission to the state's bar and maintenance
of bar membership, simply serves to ensure that the professional qualifications of all Department lawyers have in
fact been examined. No comment received by the Department demonstrates that Congress intended the requirement to
have the further effect of interfering with the Attorney General's ability to ensure effective federal law enforcement
or of compelling federal attorneys to comply with state bar ethical standards that contradict federal rules.

The Department's Power to Preempt State Ethics Rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One individual, one state court judge, and five organizations, including the Special Committee of the Conference
of Chief Justices, commented that the Department does not have the constitutional power to preempt state regulation
of its attorneys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should first be noted that in most instances the force and effect of these rules should not depend on whether they
preempt state ethics rules under the Supremacy Clause. As already noted, communications within the scope of the regulation
are intended to constitute communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of DR 7&hyph;104, Model
Rule 4.2, and analogous disciplinary rules. Therefore, if the relevant state rule contains an authorized-by-law
exception, this regulation should be seen as constituting such authorization, thereby bringing any attorney communication
permissible under these rules in conformity with that state law and eliminating the Supremacy Clause issue.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Committee of Chief Justices commented that it is the exclusive province of the state supreme courts to construe
state disciplinary rules and to determine whether this regulation falls within the ``authorized by law'' exception
to these rules. The Department has simply expressed its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
intention
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to fit communications made pursuant to these rules within the ``authorized by law'' exception to state and local federal
court rules, and its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
belief
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that this regulation indeed constitutes legal authorization for such communications. The Department notes that
it would seem to require a very strained reading to conclude that a regulation duly promulgated after notice and comment
and within the scope of its delegated authority does not also constitute ``law.''

intent before the phrase `authorized by law' in [18 U.S.C.] &sect;1905 could be held to have a narrower ambit than the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department recognizes that situations may arise in which the power of this regulation to displace state
rules will depend on its preemptive force under the Supremacy Clause. Such situations may arise in several forms:
where the applicable ethics rule has no ``authorized by law'' exception; where this regulation is deemed not to constitute
``law'' for purposes of such exception; or where a communication is held to violate the applicable ethics rule and
not be ``authorized'' by this regulation. Therefore, an important feature of this regulation is its express intention
to preempt and supersede the operation of state and local federal court rules as they relate to contacts by Department
attorneys, regardless of whether such rules are inconsistent or consistent with this regulation, absent a finding
of a willful violation of these rules by the Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preemption of state regulation of contacts with represented persons, except when the Attorney General has found
a willful violation of the federal regulation, was an integral feature of this rule as proposed earlier. The proposed
rule reflected the Department's belief that preemption of state and local rules, which have been unevenly applied,
is necessary to ensure that government attorneys' conduct respecting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts is subject to uniform and predictable standards. The Department has made minor revisions to section 77.12
to clarify that the Department's intent is to displace even purportedly consistent state regulation in this area
(or, as it is commonly phrased, to ``occupy the field'' of reviewing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts by Department attorneys). The rules and this commentary now state in more express terms the Department's
intention to preclude any state regulation of government attorneys respecting the subject matter of these rules,
unless the Attorney General first finds a willful violation of these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments suggested that the Attorney General lacks the authority to preempt state disciplinary rules, absent
an explicit Congressional authorization to do so. These comments misconceive the power of a federal agency or department
to preempt state regulation. Congress may, of course, expressly preempt all state regulation in a particular field,

In promulgating this regulation, the Department is acting within the scope of its discretionary authority. The ample
consideration given to this regulation and its earlier versions reflects the Department's effort reasonably to
accommodate the relevant policies concerning law enforcement and professional conduct, and, as discussed in the
previous section, there is no basis for concluding that the Department has exceeded its statutory authority. Moreover,
the purpose of these rules, as defined in section 77.1, is to ``ensure the Department's ability to enforce federal
law effectively and ethically'' and so fulfill the Department's statutory responsibilities.

 355 U.S. 570, 575 (1958). One individual and two organizations commented that this regulation, if promulgated, would
abrogate the primary authority of federal courts to regulate the conduct of attorneys arising out of federal law enforcement
proceedings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department views this concern as significant but essentially theoretical, because the regulation has been crafted
so that it will not operate in a way that puts it into conflict with local district court rules. However, in response
to these comments, it should be noted that through this regulation the Department does intend not only to preempt the
application by state courts of state rules relating to contacts by attorneys for the government, but also to supersede
the application by federal courts of the local federal district court rules relating to contacts by government attorneys
in civil and criminal law enforcement investigations and proceedings.

 &sect;77.12 and accompanying commentary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two reasons why the promulgation and operation of this regulation is unlikely to present the issue of abrogation
of federal court authority identified by these commenters. The first is that the regulation adopts the line of analysis
adopted by the great weight of authority interpreting local district court rules governing contacts with represented
persons.

, 498 U.S. 855 (1990). The Department has not sought in this regulation to validate conduct that would otherwise be
invalid under most local district court rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, nearly all district courts that have adopted local rules governing contacts with represented persons
have incorporated the ``authorized by law'' exception in the Model Rules or in the corresponding state rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See generally Rand,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 926 F.2d at 601&hyph;603. As explained above, this regulation constitutes ``law'' within the meaning of any such
exception. Thus, the conduct this regulation authorizes is for that reason equally authorized by these local district
court rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, this regulation in practice should not present any tension between the federal executive and judicial powers.
In response to the commenters' suggestion that any tension would have to be resolved in favor of the judicial power,
however, the Department disagrees. Were the issue to arise, it would be properly considered, as an initial matter,
as a question of the proper exercise of delegated legislative authority. Congress, not the courts, has the primary
power to prescribe rules for the federal courts.

975 F.2d 102, 107 (3d Cir. 1992) (Rules of Criminal Procedure). A local rule inconsistent with a regulation lawfully
issued under statutory authority is, as a matter of law, inconsistent with the underlying statute, and must yield
to Congress's paramount authority as delegated to the department or agency issuing the regulation. Thus, the conclusion
that the Attorney General has the statutory authority to promulgate the proposed regulation entails the further
conclusion that the regulation displaces inconsistent local federal court rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the regulation has been carefully drawn in such a way so that once a person has been brought before a court,
in general no substantive communication can occur without the consent of counsel unless: the court finds a knowing,
intelligent, and voluntary waiver; the communication is made pursuant to court-approved discovery procedures;
or the communication concerns a criminal or civil offense different from the offense before the court. The regulation
thus accords substantial and appropriate deference to the court's supervisory authority over the parties and proceedings
before it. Moreover, this regulation does not purport to disturb the authority of federal courts to fashion appropriate
remedies when an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

a district court to assert supervisory authority to regulate and sanction the conduct of executive branch attorneys

that judgment has been embodied in a duly promulgated regulation, and when the conduct concerns persons who have not
yet come before the court.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sufficiency of Internal Enforcement Mechanisms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Four organizations and two individuals commented that these rules, as proposed, lacked enforcement mechanisms
sufficient to deter prohibited communications. These comments took two forms: (1) a general suggestion that the
Department could not be trusted to police itself (or as, one commenter put it, it would be a case of ``the fox maintain[ing]
.&blank;.&blank;. guard over the hen-house''); and (2) a specific concern that the restrictions to be placed in the
United States Attorneys' Manual would not in fact be enforced against Department attorneys who violated them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Attorney General has exclusive authority over any violations of these rules. As a general matter, violations
of these rules will be addressed as matters of attorney discipline by the Department, rather than by any external disciplinary
authority. Only if the Attorney General finds a willful violation of these rules may sanctions for the violations
be imposed by a state disciplinary authority. This disciplinary structure reflects the Department's belief that
allowing sanctions to be issued independent of the Department's internal review process would frustrate the Department's
efforts to eliminate the current uncertainty arising from the differing interpretations of the various anti-contact
rules by federal courts, state courts, and state disciplinary authorities. The Department intends fully to enforce
these rules and to issue appropriate and strong sanctions for any violation of these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also disagrees with those comments that suggest that the provisions the Department currently intends
to add to the United States Attorneys' Manual will not be enforced. The Manual contains a great number of significant
Department of Justice policies, many of which impose substantial restrictions on Department attorneys. There is
no evidence that such policies are routinely overlooked by Department attorneys or that violations of policies set
forth in the Manual are not regarded by the Department as serious breaches of professional duties. On the contrary,
the failure to follow such policies is taken very seriously. The Department expects its attorneys involved in criminal
or civil law enforcement to follow all provisions in the Manual amendments that it intends to issue regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts. Failure to follow such rules will result in appropriate discipline by the Department.

Section 77.2: Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following terms are defined in section 77.2 of this part. In the final rule, unlike in the proposed rule, these terms
are arranged alphabetically for the reader's ease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
``Attorney for the government.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``attorney for the government'' includes virtually all Department of Justice attorneys with investigative,
litigative, or management responsibilities, regardless of title. It does not, however, include law enforcement
agents employed by the Department of Justice who are also members of state bars, if they are employed as, and are performing
the function of, agents rather than attorneys. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Agency and
other investigative agencies have long recruited individuals with advanced degrees_including, for example, engineering,
business, and law degrees_to serve as agents. The Department strongly encourages the recruitment of educated and
specially-trained individuals for positions as agents. An agent's bar membership should not adversely affect his
or her ability to conduct comprehensive investigations and otherwise to fulfill his or her law enforcement functions.
Therefore, the rule specifically exempts attorney-agents from its scope if they are employed by the government as
investigative agents and not as attorneys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term also does not include attorneys for departments or agencies outside the Department of Justice, regardless
of their litigative authority, except to the extent such persons have been specially appointed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
515 or 543.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two Department of Justice components commented that the definition of ``attorney for the government,'' which explicitly
covers attorneys employed in the six main divisions of the Department, should be amended to cover all attorneys working
in the legal offices of the various Department agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The Department agrees that the definition of ``attorney for the government'' should not
distinguish between attorneys employed in the Department's divisions and attorneys employed in the Department's
agencies, given that both sets of attorneys exercise similar functions and responsibilities with respect to criminal
investigations and prosecutions. Accordingly, the definition of ``attorney for the government'' has been modified
to include explicitly ``the Chief Counsel of the DEA and any attorney employed in that office, the General Counsel
of the FBI and any attorney employed in that office or in the Legal Counsel Division of the FBI, and, in addition, any
attorney employed in, or head of, any other legal office in a Department of Justice agency.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Civil Law Enforcement Investigation.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This term includes any investigation of potential civil violations of, or claims under, federal law that may form
the basis of a civil law enforcement proceeding, as defined in paragraph 77.2(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Civil Law Enforcement Proceeding.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``civil law enforcement proceeding'' encompasses a variety of activities beyond the particular areas identified
in the definition, which are intended only to be illustrative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exclusion of proceedings related to the enforcement of an administrative subpoena or summons or a civil investigative
demand (CID) is intended to ensure that the filing of such a proceeding does not trigger the limitations of section
77.5, which generally prohibits 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications once adversary proceedings have commenced against a represented ``party.'' Thus, the filing by
the United States of a proceeding to enforce a subpoena, summons, or CID will not prohibit further investigatory communications
regarding the underlying substantive violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final sentence of paragraph 77.2(c)(2) ensures that the United States need not be the plaintiff in order for a civil
action to be ``brought by the United States,'' but may be a counterclaimant or cross-claimant if the counterclaim
or cross-claim otherwise fits within the description of civil law enforcement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cooperating witness or individual.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A ``cooperating witness or individual'' is defined to include informants, witnesses, and other persons who are not
law enforcement agents, but only to the extent that such a person is acting ``to assist the government in an undercover
or confidential capacity.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

in which the identity of a government employee, or the fact that an individual is cooperating with the government,

Section 77.3: Represented Party; Represented Person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section differentiates between a represented ``party'' and a represented ``person.'' This distinction is
fully consistent with the language of and principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104(a)(1) and Model Rule 4.2, which establish
general prohibitions against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with a represented ``party.'' Section 77.5 of this part generally prohibits government attorneys from
initiating 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented parties, but does not prohibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts with represented persons. (However, sections 77.8 and 77.9 also prohibit certain contacts with represented
persons). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An individual is considered to be a ``represented party'' under paragraph 77.3(a) if: (1) the person is represented
by counsel; (2) the representation is current 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concerns the subject matter in question; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (3) the person has either been arrested or charged in a federal criminal case or is a defendant in a civil law enforcement
proceeding concerning the subject matter of the representation. If the person is currently represented in fact regarding
the subject matter in question, but has not been charged or arrested, that person is considered a ``represented person.''
Thus, witnesses, suspects, and targets of investigations who have not been indicted or arrested, but are represented
regarding the subject matter in question, are considered represented persons under this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters argued that this section's basic distinction between represented ``persons'' and represented
``parties'' runs counter to the policy considerations underlying DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2. However,
as discussed in the ``General Comments'' section, this distinction is consistent with the vast majority of federal
court opinions interpreting DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2., as well as the text of those rules. Furthermore,
this distinction is grounded in logic and common sense, given the legitimate necessity for attorneys for the government
to be able to direct agents and cooperating witnesses to contact represented persons during undercover investigations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One organization commented that prosecutors will hold back on filing formal charges in order to maximize their ability
to communicate with represented ``persons.'' The Department does not agree that prosecutors are likely to engage
in this kind of systematic manipulation. The capacity to do so exists under the Sixth Amendment (given that the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel attaches only once formal charges are filed,

, 430 U.S. 387, 398 (1979)), but there is no evidence of systematic prosecutorial abuse of the charging process under
the Sixth Amendment. Furthermore, the Department intends to add a new provision to the United States Attorneys' Manual
that will prohibit a Department attorney from communicating overtly with a ``target'' of an investigation before
he or she is formally charged or named as a civil defendant, except in specifically enumerated circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section makes clear that this regulation does not purport to authorize any communication prohibited by the Constitution
or any federal statute or Federal Rule of Criminal or Civil Procedure. Although these rules do not supersede the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, this limitation does not extend to other rules
regarding procedure in federal courts. Thus, rules of procedure adopted by individual courts as local rules, many
of which incorporate state bar rules, are not included in this limitation; and, in fact, this regulation is explicitly
intended to supersede local federal court rules regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts by attorneys for the government.

Section 77.5: General Rule for Civil and Criminal Enforcement; Represented Parties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section closely tracks the language of DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2 and applies similar prohibitions
to attorneys for the government. The section prohibits an attorney for the government from communicating with a represented
party, as defined in section 77.3, about the subject matter of the representation without the consent of that individual's
attorney. As with DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2, the prohibition applies only if the attorney for the government
knows that the represented party is, in fact, represented by counsel. Therefore, communications by an attorney for
the government with a represented party will not violate this rule if the attorney for the government is unaware of
the fact of representation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also prohibits an attorney for the government from causing another individual to communicate with a
represented party. Accordingly, this rule proscribes an attorney from directing a government investigator to do
what the attorney himself or herself is prohibited from doing. Conversely, a government attorney will not be personally
responsible for the actions of agents in communicating with represented persons unless, in doing so, the agents were
acting as the attorney's ``alter ego.''

It also should be noted that this provision is violated (and thus, a basis for departmental discipline exists) when

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section describes the circumstances under which Department attorneys may communicate, or cause others to communicate,
with a represented party whom the Department attorney knows is represented concerning the subject matter of the representation,
without first obtaining the consent of the represented party's counsel.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This exception recognizes the fact that there is no reason to prohibit a limited inquiry about whether an individual
is, in fact, represented by counsel regarding the relevant subject matter. Such an inquiry does not involve the kind
of communication about which courts have expressed concern and has little potential for undermining the attorney-client
relationship. It is also consistent with DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) and Model Rule 4.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be uncertainty about the existence of representation with respect to whether it has been established, whether
it may have been terminated, and whether a particular subject falls within the scope of the representation. The first
issue typically arises before a judicial or other appearance, when the government attorney has some information
suggesting that the person may be represented. It also may arise when an attorney purports to represent a group of persons,
such as all the employees of a corporation. Uncertainty about the termination of the representation may arise when
substantial time has passed since it was made known that the person was represented by counsel or when the attorney
for the government has reason to believe that the representation has ceased. It is unlikely, however, that such uncertainty
will arise when there are pending judicial proceedings, because in such circumstances the court in most jurisdictions
must approve termination of representation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to one comment, it is worth clarifying that that representation is presumed to cease to be current for purposes
of these rules when the matter in question has reached a final judgment (i.e., once the direct appeals process, including
any petition for certiorari, has run its full course), unless there is reason to believe that representation is continuing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When inquiring about the status of representation, government attorneys and agents generally must refrain from
stating whether it is necessary or desirable to be represented by counsel. After the right to counsel has attached,
a statement or implication suggesting that counsel is not providing proper or effective representation could violate
the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.

One organization commented that the right to inquire whether a party is represented by counsel is an invitation to
a more substantive conversation with a represented party with respect to the matter underlying the representation,
which would violate these rules. The Department does not agree that this paragraph creates a significant potential
for abuse. This exception, which is clear in its terms, allows Department attorneys to do no more than determine whether
a person is in fact represented by counsel. The Department expects that all Department attorneys will understand
the limited parameters and purpose of this exception, and any attempt to use this paragraph to gather additional information
about the subject matter of the representation would be a clear violation of these rules and would constitute sanctionable
conduct.

with process has an opportunity to consult with counsel prior to his or her appearance at the proceeding, and may have
counsel present if desired during the proceeding (except, of course, while testifying before a grand jury). More
generally, communications authorized by discovery procedures already have in place appropriate mechanisms for
protection of the attorney-client relationship. This provision ensures that this regulation does not prevent such
communications from continuing to be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This exception does not purport to authorize any communications not otherwise available pursuant to approved discovery
procedures or legal process. However, one individual commented that the text of paragraph (b), as proposed in March

in the absence of the party's attorney and without the attorney's prior agreement_even where such practice was not
in accordance with the rules of the applicable tribunal. To clarify that this paragraph's intent is to authorize only
approved discovery procedures or legal process, this paragraph has been amended in the final rule to exempt only those
communications made pursuant to discovery procedures or legal process ``in accordance with the orders or rules of
the court or other tribunal where the matter is pending.''

Initiation of communication by represented party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph sets out the circumstances under which it is proper for a government attorney to communicate with a
represented party who has initiated contact, without the consent of that party's counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A defendant may wish to communicate with the government outside the presence of counsel for many valid reasons. For
instance, a defendant may wish to cooperate with the government but not want his or her attorney to know for fear that
the attorney will disclose the defendant's intentions to others. This situation may arise, for example, when the
defendant's attorney is being paid by another individual involved in a criminal enterprise, and the defendant questions
whether he or she has the attorney's undivided loyalty. The same problem may arise when a single attorney represents
multiple parties who are part of the same criminal enterprise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the desire of a defendant or arrestee to speak with the attorney for the government outside the presence of his
or her counsel is ``voluntary, knowing, and informed,'' there is no valid reason to prohibit the government from engaging
in such communications. In fact, the Department believes that it would be a dereliction of its obligation vigorously
to enforce federal law if it promulgated a rule that would prohibit such communications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that an individual who is entitled to counsel under the Fifth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment
may waive that right and choose to communicate with the government outside the presence of his or her attorney, ``provided
the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.'' Moran

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This paragraph includes procedural protections designed to ensure that such waivers are in fact voluntary, knowing,
and informed. After a represented individual has been arrested or charged in a criminal proceeding or is named as a
defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding, this paragraph requires that several steps be taken before a government
attorney may engage in a substantive discussion with the represented party. First, the government attorney must
inform the individual of his or her right to speak through his or her attorney and to have that attorney present for any
communications with the government attorney. Second, the represented party must manifest his or her desire to waive
the right to counsel in a voluntary, knowing, and informed way. If at all possible, the attorney for the government
should obtain a signed written waiver. Third, the attorney for the government must bring the matter before the appropriate
district court judge, magistrate judge, or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. Then, it is up to the court to
determine that the waiver satisfies the provisions of this rule or that substitute counsel is in place (including
counsel appointed at that time by the court) who has consented to the communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph does not require, however, that the waiver must always take place before the judge or magistrate judge.
In exceptional circumstances, it may be impractical or unsafe to bring the defendant before a judge or magistrate
judge to secure the waiver. In such circumstances, the government attorney may secure a waiver from the defendant
outside the court, and, before any substantive discussion between the defendant and the government takes place,
bring evidence of the waiver to the court so that the court can determine whether the waiver was made knowingly, intelligently,
and voluntarily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One United States Attorney's Office commented that paragraph (c), as proposed, appeared to require an attorney first
to obtain an informed waiver and only after receiving such a waiver to bring the matter before the appropriate tribunal.
The Department does not intend to require (and does not understand the text of paragraph (c) to require) an attorney
for the government, when contacted by a represented party, necessarily to attempt to secure a waiver himself or herself
before bringing the matter to the attention of the court. A government attorney who is contacted by a represented party
may, consistent with this paragraph, choose to bring the matter directly to the attention of the court, assuming the
represented party has manifested his or her desire to waive the right to counsel. The court then would determine whether
the party wishes to waive the presence of counsel for the communication. In general, however, the usual practice is
for the government attorney to obtain from the represented party a waiver before bringing the matter before the court.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the initiation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts by represented parties frequently occurs in the context of the ``fearful defendant'' whose attorney has
been chosen by a third party, often an individual above the defendant in the criminal hierarchy. Such a defendant may
wish to cooperate with the government but may fear that his life or safety will be endangered if his attorney learns
of the cooperation. Although the need for a mechanism by which a represented party can initiate contacts with the government
is particularly acute in this context, paragraph (c) is not limited to this setting. Rather, the proper inquiry is
whether the represented party's waiver of the right to counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed, not whether the
represented party has established some overriding justification for his or her decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One organization objected to the extension of this exception to anyone other than a ``fearful defendant,'' suggesting
that any other client will have no better reason to initiate communication than ``a misguided belief that he can help
himself by talking to the prosecutor.'' The Department believes that it would be overly paternalistic to refuse to
permit any but fearful represented parties to initiate direct contact with the government. Given that a criminal
defendant has a constitutional right to decline legal representation entirely, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

California
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), government attorneys should not be ethically bound to refuse to listen to a criminal defendant
who chooses to decline the presence of counsel for purposes of a particular communication with appropriate court
approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it would be neither workable nor proper to require a Department attorney or judicial officer to probe
the client about his or her relationship with counsel in order to ascertain whether the client is genuinely fearful,
or fearful enough, of his or her attorney's involvement to justify a conversation outside the presence of counsel.
Such an inquiry would tend to enhance, not minimize, intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. A more reliable
protection of the client's interest and of the attorney-client relationship is this paragraph's careful process
of testing the client's desire (as opposed to the client's reasons) for waiving the presence of counsel. This is the
same analysis the courts undertake in assessing waivers of the constitutional rights to counsel or against self-incrimination.
The proper issue in such a setting, as here, is whether the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paragraph (d): Waivers at the time of arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The previous paragraph (paragraph (c)) provides the general guidelines regarding how a represented party may waive
protections otherwise provided under this regulation. This paragraph provides for a different rule dealing specifically
with a waiver at the time of arrest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that a government attorney may communicate directly with a represented party ``at the time
of arrest of the represented party'' without the consent of that party's counsel, provided that the represented party
has been fully informed of his or her constitutional rights at that time and has waived them. The government attorney
need not comply with any of the additional requirements of paragraph (c) in such a situation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A substantial body of law has developed regarding waiver of constitutional rights in the immediate post-arrest setting.
The Department believes that the constitutional protections established in that decisional law adequately protect
represented individuals following arrest. Furthermore, the effectiveness of post-arrest interviews would be
significantly curtailed if the procedural requirements of paragraph (c) applied. Accordingly, this paragraph
is intended to preserve this investigative tool without adding any additional procedural requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received two comments regarding this paragraph: one relating to the timing of the waiver, and the other
relating to the terms of the waiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Department component commented that it would clarify the meaning of a communication ``at the time of the arrest of
the represented person'' to add to the text that such communication must be made ``at the time of the arrest of the represented
party before he or she is presented to a judicial officer with respect to that arrest . . . .'' The Department has decided
against adopting the proposed additional language, because it would unadvisedly extend this exception beyond its
proper and intended narrow limits. This exception to the general rule against post-arrest communications is designed
to preserve the ability of government attorneys to interview individuals immediately (i.e., within hours) following
arrest as an effective and important law enforcement tool. See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 18 U.S.C. 3501(c). It is not intended to allow government attorneys to attempt to initiate communications with an
arrested person any time before the person is presented to a judicial officer, which can extend days beyond the ``time
of arrest.'' The Department believes that such an extension of this limited exception could put excessive pressure
on clients and unduly intrude upon the attorney-client relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A United States Attorney's Office commented that proposed paragraph (d), under which the represented party must
be advised of and waive ``his or her constitutional rights,'' could be construed to require the represented party
to be explicitly told that he or she has a right to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
contacts with a represented party if the contacts involve the investigation of offenses as to which the represented
party has been neither arrested nor charged in a criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. The Department believes
this approach is wholly consistent with DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 and the cases interpreting those rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this section provides that communications may be made in the course of investigations of additional,
different, or ongoing criminal or unlawful activity, even though the individual is represented by counsel with respect
to conduct for which he or she has already been arrested or charged. Such additional criminal or unlawful conduct is
typically one of three varieties: (1) conduct that is separate from the original wrongful conduct; (2) crimes or unlawful
conduct that are intended to impede the administration of justice or the trial of the charged crime, such as subornation
of perjury, obstruction of justice, jury tampering, or murder, assault, or intimidation of witnesses; and (3) conduct
that is a continuation of the charged crime, such as a conspiracy or a scheme to defraud that continues past the time
of indictment. The new or additional criminal or wrongful activity may have occurred in the past or may be ongoing at
the time of the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One organization objected to this section's coverage of criminal or wrongful activity that has already been completed
at the time of the communication, as distinct from activity that is ongoing. However, the Department sees no basis
in the policies underlying the Sixth Amendment and the Model Rules for basing the propriety of investigation into
additional or different uncharged crimes on whether such activity is complete or ongoing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One individual expressed concern that Department attorneys would exploit this exception by making gratuitous allusions
to other offenses in the course of an otherwise illicit contact with a represented party. As noted above, prevailing
case law interpreting the Sixth Amendment and the Model Rules permit an attorney to question a defendant as to uncharged
offenses, and there is no evidence of systemic prosecutorial abuse of this type of interrogation. Accordingly, there
is no reason to suspect that prosecutorial practice under these rules will be different.

] prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination''). This paragraph
recognizes an analogous exception to the general prohibition against communications with represented parties
in the absence of their counsel. It is the Department's intention that this exception be invoked only in rare circumstances
and only for the purpose of protecting human life or safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception has three requirements: (1) the attorney for the government must have a good faith belief that the safety
or life of any person is threatened; (2) the purpose of the communication must be to obtain information to protect against
the risk of injury or death; and (3) the attorney for the government must, in good faith, believe that the communication
is reasonably necessary to protect against such risk. These requirements are imposed to ensure that the exception
is invoked only to protect human life or safety, and not as a routine matter in violent crime prosecutions. For example,
the fact that potentially dangerous firearms have not been recovered would not in and of itself be sufficient under
ordinary circumstances to constitute a threat to safety under this exception. Furthermore, the communication must
be for the purpose of protecting human life or safety, and may not be designed to elicit testimonial evidence. However,
information thus obtained may be used for any purpose consistent with constitutional limitations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts therefore does not apply. This section makes clear that attorneys for the government are authorized to communicate,
directly or indirectly, with a represented person unless the contact is prohibited by some other provision of federal
law. These communications are subject, however, to the restrictions set forth in sections 77.8 and 77.9 regarding
certain categories of negotiations and respect for attorney-client relationships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two individuals commented that this section, even as limited by sections 77.8 and 77.9, allows a broader range of contact
with persons under investigation than is necessary to meet the Department's legitimate investigative needs. These
individuals agreed that the government must be free to conduct undercover operations and investigations, even when
field investigators coming into contact with potential criminal or civil respondents are directed by government
attorneys. They argued, however, that overt communications with persons during the investigative stage are not
similarly justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that overt communications between a government attorney and a represented person during the
investigative stage raise different considerations from covert communications and should be subject to greater
restrictions. For this reason, the Department plans to make revisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual providing
that government attorneys should engage in overt communications only after carefully considering whether the communication
is more appropriately handled by others, and should generally not communicate overtly, or cause another to communicate
overtly, with a target of a federal criminal or civil investigation, who is known by the Department attorney to be represented
by counsel, concerning the subject matter of the representation. Nevertheless, the Department believes that overt
contacts by federal attorneys and agents with witnesses and subjects of investigations are often necessary for effective
law enforcement and hence should be permitted.

person, it ordinarily would be improper for a government attorney to initiate or negotiate a plea agreement, settlement,
immunity agreement or any other disposition of a claim or charge without the consent of the individual's counsel.
The one exception to this prohibition occurs when the communication is initiated by the represented person or represented
party and the procedural safeguards provided for in paragraph 77.6(c) are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section is important for the preservation of the attorney-client relationship.
One of the primary purposes of DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 is to protect an individual represented by counsel from
overreaching by an attorney for an adversary. The Department believes the risk and the consequences of such overreaching
are at their greatest during negotiations over plea agreements, settlements, and other key legal agreements. The
training, experience, and knowledge of the law possessed by an attorney is particularly valuable in such situations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prohibition contained in this section includes all negotiations of the terms of a particular plea agreement,
settlement agreement, or other agreement covered by the section. However, this section does not prohibit an attorney
for the government from responding to questions regarding the nature of such agreements, potential charges, potential
penalties, or other subjects related to such agreements during an otherwise permissible discussion. Nevertheless,
an attorney for the government should take care in such situations not to go beyond providing information on these
and similar subjects and should generally refer the represented person to his or her counsel for further discussion
of these issues. The government attorney should also make it clear that he or she will not negotiate any agreement with
respect to the disposition of criminal charges, civil claims or potential charges, or immunity agreements without
the consent of counsel.

Paragraph (a): Deference to Attorney-Client Relationship
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal courts have recognized that it is improper for an attorney for the government to disparage counsel for the
represented party or otherwise to seek to disrupt the relationship between that party and his attorney.

. at 740&hyph;41 (Godbold, J., specially concurring). This paragraph codifies those basic principles by prohibiting
communications that: (1) attempt to elicit information regarding lawful defense strategies; (2) disparage the
represented party's counsel; or (3) otherwise improperly seek to disrupt the attorney-client relationship. These
prohibitions apply in every phase of criminal and civil enforcement investigations and proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the paragraph also accommodates an important exception to this prohibition. Courts have held that a government
attorney may not permit legal proceedings to go forward if he or she is aware of a conflict of interest between a represented
party and his or her lawyer.

, 786 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1986). Under this circumstance, the attorney for the government ordinarily should move to
disqualify the lawyer involved, if legal proceedings have already commenced. If it is not feasible to move for disqualification
or otherwise challenge the representation, this paragraph allows an attorney for the government to communicate
with the represented individual for the limited purpose of apprising the represented individual of the perceived
conflict. However, any substantive discussion of the subject matter of the representation is permissible only insofar
as it is authorized by some other provision of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to ensure that this provision is used only in rare circumstances, the rule requires prior authorization for
such communications from the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, an
Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney. The authorization should be in writing if at all possible.
Furthermore, before providing approval, the authorizing officer must find: (1) a substantial likelihood of a conflict;
and (2) that it is not feasible to obtain a court order on the matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One organization commented that judicial approval, or at least approval by a designated Assistant Attorney General
(rather than by a United States Attorney), should be required before an attorney for the government may apprise a represented
party or person of any perceived conflict of interest. Another organization and an individual commented that attorneys
for the government should never be allowed to inform a represented individual of a perceived conflict of interest,
and, instead, should be required to move to disqualify counsel and leave it to the court to adjudicate any conflicts
of interest. The Department believes that there will be circumstances in which it will not be feasible to obtain a judicial
order challenging the representation (especially prior to the filing of charges), or when the exigencies of the situation
may make it impracticable to obtain prior authorization of a judicial officer or an Assistant Attorney General. In
such circumstances, and when a high-level Department official, such as a United States Attorney, determines that
there is a significant likelihood of a conflict of interest between a represented individual and his or her attorney,
it is better that the represented person or party be apprised of the potential conflict of interest than be left uninformed.
Accordingly, the Department has decided to leave this paragraph unchanged in the final rule.

Paragraph (b): Attorney-Client Meetings

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attendance of an undercover agent or a cooperating witness at lawful meetings of an individual and his or her attorneys
is ordinarily an improper intrusion into the attorney-client relationship. The courts have recognized, however,
that such attendance occasionally will be required when the operative is invited to participate and his or her refusal
to do so would effectively reveal his or her connection to the government.

Attendance at such meetings, however, intrudes into the attorney-client relationship and impairs the right of the
defendant to a fair trial. Accordingly, this section provides that undercover agents or cooperating witnesses may
participate in such meetings, but only when requested to do so by the defense and when reasonably necessary to protect
their safety or life or the confidentiality of an undercover operation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When there is reasonable cause to believe that the purpose of the meeting is not the lawful defense of the underlying
charges, but the commission of a new or additional crime (such as bribery of a witness or subordination of perjury),
attendance by informants or undercover agents at attorney-client meetings is permissible pursuant to paragraph
77.6(e). The belief, however, must be based on reasonable cause, not mere suspicion or conjecture. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Mastroianni,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 749 F.2d at 906. Furthermore, the prohibition against communication of lawful defense strategy to the prosecution
should be observed if, in fact, such strategy is imparted to the informant or agent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government attorneys should give serious consideration to the extreme sensitivity of permitting agent and informant
attendance at defense meetings. Agents and informants should be instructed to avoid participating in such meetings,
and to minimize their participation when attendance is required, if it is possible to do so without arousing suspicion.
Agents or witnesses who attend defense meetings should also be instructed to make every attempt to avoid taking any
role in the shaping of defense strategy or trial preparations. Additionally, agents and informants should be instructed
to avoid imparting lawful defense strategy or trial preparation information to attorneys for the government or to
law enforcement agents who are directly participating in the ongoing investigation or in the prosecution of pending
criminal charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this restriction applies only to law enforcement officials and cooperating witnesses who are acting as
``agents for the government'' at the time of the communication. If one of several co-defendants who attended an attorney-client
defense strategy meeting later testifies for the government at trial, no violation will have occurred as long as the
co-defendant was not a government agent at the time of the meeting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Department component commented that an undercover agent's attendance at a meeting at which legal strategy is not
discussed does not intrude on the attorney-client relationship; therefore, the component proposed limiting this
paragraph's prohibition against government agents participating in an attorney-client meeting or communication
to situations where there is a ``reasonable basis'' to believe that the meeting or communication will concern legal
advice or strategy. The Department believes that it is unwise and unworkable to encourage government attorneys and
undercover agents to guess whether legal issues will come up in an attorney-client meeting or communication. It would
also be disruptive of the attorney-client relationship for government attorneys and undercover agents to gather
the information that might make such a determination even remotely reliable. Therefore, this paragraph has not been
changed.

Section 77.10: Organizations and Employees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section addresses the difficult issue of when a communication with an employee or member of a represented organization
should be considered a communication with the organization itself. Important interests depend on this determination.
On the one hand, organizations should not be shielded from effective criminal or civil law enforcement prosecution
simply by retaining counsel. It is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to encounter attorneys who assert that they
represent every individual in a large corporation or organization. If such attorneys were able to prevent government
investigators from gaining informal access to any employee of the organization by withholding consent, information
relevant to claims against the organization might never come to light because such information is often in the exclusive
possession of the organization and its employees. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

to the effective assistance of counsel, and the relationship between an organization and its counsel deserves respect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that this section, and particularly the definition of ``controlling individual'' in paragraph
(a) of this section, strikes an appropriate balance, one that ensures government attorneys the ability to enforce
federal law, while preserving the opportunity for corporations and other organizations to secure effective assistance
of counsel.

Paragraph (a): Communications with current employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph states that a communication with a current employee of an organizational party or person should be
treated as a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a ``controlling
individual.'' If a communication with a current employee is properly characterized under this regulation as a communication
with a represented organization (that is, if the communication is with a controlling individual), then that communication
is subject generally to the same limitations that would apply if the communication were with a represented person
or represented party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accord with the basic structure of this regulation, which distinguishes between represented parties and represented
persons, this paragraph effectively provides that when an organization is a represented party, an attorney for the
government shall not communicate, or cause another to communicate, with any controlling individual of the organization
without the consent of the organization's attorney, subject to the exceptions enumerated in &sect;77.6. In contrast,
when an organization qualifies as a represented person, an attorney for the government may communicate, or cause
another to communicate, with any controlling individual, provided the communication does not violate the provisions
of &sect;&sect;77.8 or 77.9.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The definition of ``controlling individual'' is intended to encompass those individuals who typically are part
of the organization's control group. A controlling individual under this definition must: (1) be a current employee
or member of the organization; (2) hold a high-level position with the organization; (3) participate ``as a decision
maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation of the subject
matter;'' and (4) be known by the government to be engaged in such activities. This definition attempts to identify
those limited number of individuals affiliated with the organization who actually are involved in determining the
organization's position with regard to the legal proceeding or investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual and one organization questioned limiting the class of employees who should be considered ``controlling
individuals'' for purposes of this subsection to those who participate in framing the organization's legal position
in the matter. They argued that the proposed ``controlling individual'' test authorizes contacts with employees
who, while not directing the organization's counsel, nonetheless have extensive authority to act on behalf of the
organization. The underlying concern of these comments appears to be that this paragraph, as proposed, authorizes
contacts with many employees who are likely to possess information relevant to claims asserted against the corporation
and who have the capacity to make statements that a court will deem admissible at trial as evidentiary admissions against
the corporation. This is certainly true. However, the Department believes that its anti-contact rule should not
be designed with the goal of protecting corporations from disclosure of prejudicial facts. See, e.g., Action Air

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anti-contact rules such as DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 are intended to protect the attorney-client relationship
from unnecessary interference and to protect represented parties from overreaching by opposing counsel. Damage
to the attorney-client relationship inheres particularly in communications with high-level corporate employees
who have contact with the corporation's attorneys in the course of making ultimate decisions regarding choice of
counsel, implementing counsel's advice, and determining settlement and other litigation strategies. Therefore,
communications with those high-level individuals affiliated with or employed by an organization who are responsible
for employing and directing the organization's counsel and for determining legal positions taken by the organization
are the type of communications prohibited by DR 7&hyph;104.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this paragraph defines ``controlling individual'' consistently with the principles underlying
the disciplinary rules on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts. The Department also believes that the alternative approaches urged by commenters would impose unacceptable
constraints on federal law enforcement. Therefore, this paragraph has not been changed.

Paragraph (b): Communications with former employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph authorizes communications with former employees of represented organizations. Because former
employees do not direct the affairs of the organization and therefore cannot be considered members of the ``control
group'' or any other controlling entity of an organization, communications with them are not considered communications
with the organization for purposes of the rule. This reasoning is consistent with the conclusion of the majority of
federal courts that have held that DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) does not bar communications with former employees of a represented
corporate party. See, e.g., Hanntz

Paragraph (c): Communications With Former or Current Employees; Individual Representation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that if a former or current employee or a member of an organization retains his or her own counsel,
the government shall provide the same protection to him or her that would be provided under this part to any other represented
person or represented party. Communications with that individual are subject to the limitations set forth in this
part. Although this paragraph provides the general rule for such communications, paragraph (d) addresses the specific
situation in which a controlling individual of a represented organization retains separate counsel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph also provides that the government will not accept, for purposes of this rule, blanket claims by counsel
that he or she represents all or a large number of employees of the organization. It is important to note that this provision
is only relevant when the attorney for the government would be prohibited by some other provision of this regulation
from contacting an individual falling under the broad claims of representation under question. For example, an attorney
for the government may contact a low-level employee of a corporation, without consent of that employee's counsel
or the corporation's counsel, regarding a matter for which the corporation has already been indicted as part of an
undercover or overt factual investigation, if that individual has not been arrested or named as a defendant in a related
criminal or civil law enforcement proceeding. Therefore, the fact that an attorney has stated that he or she represents
that individual will have no bearing on whether the communication is proper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if a particular communication with an individual employee included in such a claim of representation would
be improper under these rules if he or she were in fact represented by counsel (for example, communications to negotiate
a plea agreement), then this paragraph provides that a government attorney must first inquire whether the employee
is in fact represented before undertaking substantive communications with the employee. As part of this inquiry,
the government attorney is not required to disclose to the employee the fact that counsel has asserted that he or she
represents the employee. If the employee indicates that he or she is not represented by counsel, it is proper for the
government attorney to treat the employee as unrepresented. If the employee indicates that he or she is represented
by counsel with regard to the relevant subject matter, the attorney for the government shall treat that employee as
a represented person or represented party, and any further communications with that individual shall be governed
by this regulation.

Paragraph (d): Communications with separately represented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph applies only when a controlling individual of a represented organizational party has retained separate
counsel. In such circumstances, a government attorney may not communicate with the controlling individual without
the consent of that individual's separate counsel unless the communication satisfies one of the exceptions contained
in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9 of this part. The paragraph also allows such communications if the individual does not
qualify as a represented party, initiates the communication, and waives the presence of counsel. Thus, the same rules
apply to contacts with controlling individuals of represented organizational parties who retain separate counsel
as apply to controlling individuals of represented organizational parties who are not separately represented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e): Initiation of communication by unrepresented controlling individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph addresses a relatively narrow circumstance: when a controlling individual who is not individually
represented by counsel initiates a communication with the government outside the presence of counsel for the organization.
An attorney for the government may participate in such communications if: (1) the controlling individual indicates
that he or she is speaking exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not as a representative of the organizational
party; and (2) he or she indicates that the waiver of counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed and, if willing, signs
a statement to that effect. The fact that the controlling individual indicates that he or she is speaking in his or her
personal capacity does not mean, however, that incriminating testimony received from the controlling individual
cannot be used against the represented organization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the controlling individual is also a named defendant in a civil enforcement proceeding or has been arrested or charged
in a criminal action, the requirements set forth in paragraph 77.6(c) must be satisfied before any substantive communications
are made.

Section 77.11: Enforcement of This Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Paragraph (a): Exclusive enforcement by Attorney General. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In order to ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of the final rule, this paragraph provides that
the Attorney General shall have exclusive authority to enforce these regulations. Thus, state courts, state disciplinary
boards, and federal courts may not impose sanctions on or otherwise regulate a Department attorney engaged in federal
law enforcement activities for violations of an anti-contact rule or subject a Department attorney to regulation
under state or local federal court rules governing communications with represented parties, except as provided
in &sect;77.12. This paragraph further provides the framework for investigating allegations that a Department
attorney has violated this regulation. It provides that the Department's Office of Professional Responsibility
(``OPR'') shall have sole original jurisdiction to investigate such allegations and that violations will be treated
as matters of attorney discipline. See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 28 CFR &sect;0.39 (establishing and defining duties of OPR). It also makes clear that the Attorney General's determination
as to whether a violation has occurred shall be final and conclusive except to the extent that the Department attorney
enjoys a right of review provided by other laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One individual and one organization objected to placing investigative responsibility in OPR, suggesting that OPR
had, in the past, been reluctant to share the results of its investigations. The Department recently adopted a policy
under which the results of OPR investigations are disclosed to the public if, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, there is a finding of intentional and knowing professional misconduct by a Department attorney in the course of an
investigation or litigation and the public interest in disclosure outweighs the privacy interest of the attorney
and any law enforcement interest. Therefore, there will be meaningful disclosure of findings of violations of these
rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, allegations of professional misconduct by Department attorneys concerning violations of these rules
may be reported directly to OPR by any person. Complaints filed by members of the public will be fully and thoroughly
reviewed by OPR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this paragraph has not been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Paragraph (b): No private remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This paragraph provides that the rule is not intended to and does not create any substantive rights for any person other
than an attorney for the government. In particular, a violation of the regulation will not provide a basis for the dismissal
of civil or criminal charges or for the suppression of evidence that is otherwise admissible. This provision accords
with existing law. Traditionally, matters relating to communications with represented persons have been treated
as matters of attorney discipline without granting substantive rights to defendants or any other persons. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both DR 7&hyph;104 and Model Rule 4.2 provide that communications that are ``authorized by law'' are not prohibited
by the rule. Virtually all the states have adopted some version of DR 7&hyph;104 or Model Rule 4.2 that includes an ``authorized
by law'' exception. As discussed in the ``General Comments'' section, these rules, as substantive regulations duly
promulgated by the Attorney General pursuant to statutory authority, have the force and effect of law. Accordingly,
communications with represented persons that are undertaken pursuant to these rules should be considered ``authorized
by law'' within the meaning of rules adopted by the various states. Such communications should therefore be consistent
with state rules wherever state bar authorities have adopted a rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception.
Thus, no conflict will arise between state and federal law in those jurisdictions with regard to communications with
represented persons. Similarly, no conflict should arise between this regulation and the federal district court
rules that have adopted an anti-contact rule containing the ``authorized by law'' exception. This regulation therefore
need not give rise to any tension with any provision of state or federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department nonetheless recognizes the likelihood that government attorneys' conduct with respect to contact
with represented persons may continue to be viewed by some as inconsistent with state or local district court rules.
To effectuate fully the provisions of this regulation, it therefore is important that the regulation include a plain
statement by the Department of its intention to preempt and supersede regulation by state courts, state disciplinary
authorities, or federal district courts of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 communications by government attorneys in civil or criminal law enforcement investigations or proceedings.

 471 U.S. 707, 718 (1985) (``because agencies normally express problems in a detailed manner and can speak through
a variety of means, including regulations, preambles, interpretative statements and responses to comments, we
can expect that they will make their intention clear if they intend for their regulations to be exclusive''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no indication from any of the comments received of any confusion regarding the breadth of the Department's
intention to displace state and federal law; on the contrary, the comments in this area generally both fully grasped
and took issue with the Department's stated intention to occupy the field. Given the integral importance of the exclusive
enforcement authority to the overall regulatory scheme, however, some revisions have been made to this section to
leave no doubt that it is the express intention of these rules to completely preempt and supersede the operation of
state and local laws or rules as they relate to contacts by government attorneys in civil or criminal law enforcement
investigations or proceedings. Such occupation of the field is necessary to ensure that government attorneys' conduct
respecting contacts with represented persons be subject to uniform regulation and predictable standards, as against
potential variations in individual state and local rules and in interpretations of those rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, this regulation completely preempts state or federal court regulation of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contacts in law enforcement matters by government attorneys and those acting at their direction, with one important
exception. If the Attorney General finds that a Department attorney has committed a ``willful violation'' of any
of these rules, preemption will not apply, and that attorney will be subject to disciplinary proceedings both by the
Department and by the appropriate state disciplinary authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters argued that it is inappropriate to preclude an otherwise appropriate state or federal court disciplinary
proceeding when the Department's own rules have been violated. The Department respectfully disagrees. A primary
purpose for this regulation is to remove the substantial burden on federal law enforcement caused by uncertainty
as to what constitutes appropriate conduct by Department attorneys. This uncertainty would not be removed were it
left to the various state and federal district courts to interpret these rules and determine on their own whether they
had been violated in any particular case. For this reason, the Department believes that it is necessary that it retain
exclusive authority to determine whether one of its lawyers has breached these rules, with the important proviso
that, when there is a finding of a willful violation, a state disciplinary authority may also impose sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One United States Attorney's Office commented that the meaning of a ``willful violation'' had not been clearly explained
in the previous commentary. In response to this comment, the Department here clarifies that a ``willful violation''
means an intentional and deliberate violation of these rules, as determined by the Attorney General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Attorneys' Manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the promulgation of the rules discussed above, the Department intends to add several new provisions
to the United States Attorneys' Manual to provide additional guidance to Department attorneys when they deal with
represented individuals during criminal or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has deliberately chosen to include certain baseline restrictions in the regulation and impose broader
restrictions through provisions in the Manual. In the process of determining what the appropriate Departmental
policy should be, it became clear that any regulation would have to apply to a variety of circumstances, including:
white collar and organized crime investigations, complex conspiracy investigations, individuals whose counsel
are paid by a third party, and individuals fearful of their counsel for various reasons. Accordingly, the Department
determined that the regulation should be broad in scope and should provide unambiguous guidance that would not adversely
affect federal law enforcement efforts. Thus, part 77 distinguishes between the investigative period (before indictment,
arrest, or the filing of a complaint) and the prosecutive period (after arrest or the commencement of formal proceedings).
It also distinguishes between communications that are part of a factual investigation and communications that occur
during negotiations of plea agreements, settlements, and similar legal arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planned Manual provisions will require that government attorneys consider the principles underlying the basic
prohibitions in a much wider variety of circumstances. The Department expects all Department attorneys involved
in criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings to adhere to all applicable provisions in the Manual. Failure to
do so will result in appropriate departmental action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planned changes to the Manual were included in the earlier publications simply for reference and were not subject
to the requirements of notice and comment that applied to the provisions in the proposed regulation itself. The Department
nonetheless received several comments regarding the draft Manual provisions. The Department has carefully considered
those comments and has decided that it is appropriate (though not required) to respond to them briefly in this commentary.
However, none of the comments received has prompted the Department to conclude that it should alter the planned Manual
provisions. The Department anticipates that the Manual provisions will be substantially similar to the draft published
in March 1994. The Department envisions publishing the Manual provisions soon and integrating them in the Manual
with the final rules adopted here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments were directed mainly to a draft Manual provision that would prohibit a government attorney from communicating
overtly about the subject matter of a representation with a person who the government attorney knows is a ``target''
of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation and who the government attorney knows is represented by
counsel, without the consent of the target's attorney. (The provisions, as published in March 1994, would also provide
several exceptions to this general prohibition against overt contacts with targets, including the following: when
the communication is initiated by the target; when the communication occurs at the time of arrest and the represented
person has waived his or her 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Miranda
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rights; when the government attorney believes the contact is necessary to protect against a risk to human life or safety;
or when a senior Department official determines that exigent circumstances exist, making the communication necessary
for effective law enforcement). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two United States Attorney's Offices urged reconsideration of the guideline generally prohibiting Department
attorneys from directly communicating with known ``targets.'' These commenters expressed a number of concerns
about the ``target'' provision_most significantly, that the determination of ``target'' status would be subjective
and variable and that the proposed limitation on overt contacts with represented targets would interfere with the
investigative process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not agree that the term ``target'' would make application of this planned restriction particularly
troublesome. While determinations of ``target'' status surely are not scientifically precise, neither are a range
of other similar determinations (e.g., ``probable cause'' determinations) that prosecutors are expected routinely
to make. In its enforcement of the planned provision, the Department intends to give substantial deference to a federal
attorney's good faith judgment regarding the likelihood that a particular person will ultimately become a defendant.
Even if the attorney for the government believes that an individual probably will be named as a defendant, that individual
would not be considered a target until the government has actually obtained substantial evidence linking that individual
to the commission of a crime or to unlawful conduct. The government attorney's uncorroborated belief that an individual
will ultimately be named as a defendant would not be enough. Thus, an individual will not be considered a target under
the Manual guidelines until both the attorney for the government believes that he or she will probably be named as a
defendant 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 substantial evidence has been obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also does not believe that the contemplated restriction on overt communications with represented
targets would significantly impede legitimate law enforcement activities. It is true that in certain types of cases
and under certain exceptional circumstances, target interviews may be necessary for effective investigation;
for that reason, the planned Manual provisions would allow that in such situations target interviews may be approved
by a high-ranking Department official. However, as a general matter and in more routine circumstances, overt communications
with targets have a more limited value to the investigative process, which is outweighed by the risk that they will
interfere with the attorney-client relationship and place undue pressure on the target. Because an individual who
is a target of a federal investigation is typically in a clearly adversarial relationship with the federal government,
the Department believes that the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are implicated and that the planned
restrictions on overt communications with represented targets are appropriate.

principles underlying Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct, while eliminating
the uncertainty and confusion arising from the variety of interpretations given to that rule and analogous rules
by state and federal courts and by bar association organizations and committees. (Copies of the Bar rules are on file
in most law libraries, and through on-line legal research services).

516; to direct officers of the Department to conduct grand jury proceedings and other civil and criminal legal proceedings,
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 515(a); to supervise litigation and to direct Department officers in the discharge of their
duties, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 519; and otherwise to direct Department officers to detect and prosecute crimes, to
prosecute offenses against the United States, to prosecute civil actions, suits, and proceedings in which the United
States is concerned, and to perform such other functions in an appropriate and ethical manner as may be provided by
law, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, 533, and 547.

with a represented person or represented party pursuant to any provision of these regulations without the consent
of counsel, the following restrictions must be observed: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deference to attorney-client relationship. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) An attorney for the government, or anyone acting at his or her direction may not, when communicating with a represented
person or represented party: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Inquire about information regarding lawful defense strategy or legal arguments of counsel; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Disparage counsel for a represented person or represented party or otherwise seek to induce the person to forego

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, the
Associate Attorney General, an Assistant Attorney General or a United States Attorney finds that there is a substantial
likelihood that there exists a significant conflict of interest between a represented person or party and his or her
attorney; and that it is not feasible to obtain a judicial order challenging the representation, then an attorney
for the government with prior written authorization from an official identified above may apprise the person of the
nature of the perceived conflict of interest, unless the exigencies of the situation permit only prior oral authorization,
in which case such oral authorization shall be memorialized in writing as soon thereafter as possible.

to attend or participate in lawful attorney-client meetings or communications, except when the agent or witness
is requested to do so by the represented person or party, defense counsel, or another person affiliated or associated
with the defense, and when reasonably necessary to protect the safety of the agent or witness or the confidentiality
of an undercover operation. If the agent or witness attends or participates in such meetings, any information regarding
lawful defense strategy or trial preparation imparted to the agent or witness shall not be communicated to attorneys
for the government or to law enforcement agents who are directly participating in the ongoing investigation or in
the prosecution of pending criminal charges, or used in any other way to the substantial detriment of the client.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with current employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A communication with a current employee of an organization that qualifies as a represented party or represented person
shall be considered to be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part only if the employee is a controlling
individual. A ``controlling individual'' is a current high level employee who is known by the government to be participating
as a decision maker in the determination of the organization's legal position in the proceeding or investigation
of the subject matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former employees; organizational representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A communication with a former employee of an organization that is represented by counsel shall not be considered to
be a communication with the organization for purposes of this part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Communications with former or current employees; individual representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A communication with a former or current employee of an organization who is individually represented by counsel may
occur only to the extent otherwise permitted by this part. However, a claim by an attorney that he or she represents
all or a large number of individual current and/or former employees of an organization does not suffice to establish
that those employees are represented persons or represented parties under this part. In such circumstances, prior
to engaging in communications that would be prohibited under this part as a result of the individual representation,
the attorney for the government shall communicate with the individual current or former employee to determine if
in fact that employee is represented by counsel concerning the subject matter of the investigation or proceeding.

Communications with separately represented controlling individuals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When this part would preclude discussions with a controlling individual as defined in &sect;77.10(a) and the controlling
individual has retained separate counsel on the relevant subject matter, an attorney for the government may communicate
with such individual in the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the controlling individual's separate counsel consents;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the communication falls within one of the exceptions set forth in &sect;&sect;77.6 or 77.9; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) In the case in which the individual does not qualify as a represented party, if the individual initiates the communication
and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal capacity and not on behalf of the represented
organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel for the communication is voluntary, knowing
and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initiation of communication with unrepresented controlling individuals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, an attorney for the government may communicate with a controlling
individual who is not individually represented as to the subject matter of the communication when the controlling
individual initiates the communication and states that he or she is communicating exclusively in his or her personal
capacity and not on behalf of the represented organizational party, and manifests that his or her waiver of counsel
for the communication is voluntary, knowing, and informed, and, if willing to do so, signs a written statement to this
effect.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Multiple representation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to affect the requirements of Rule 44(c) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure, or to permit the multiple representation of an organization and any of its employees, or the
multiple representation of more than one such employee, if such representation is prohibited by any applicable law
or rule of attorney ethics.

 The Attorney General shall have exclusive authority over this part and any violations of it, except as provided in
&sect;77.12. Allegations of violations of this part shall be reviewed exclusively by the Office of Professional
Responsibility of the Department of Justice and shall be addressed when appropriate as matters of attorney discipline
by the Department. The Office of Professional Responsibility shall review any complaint alleging a violation of
this part made by a state or federal judge, bar disciplinary board, official, or ethics committee, or by any other person
or entity. The findings of the Attorney General or her designee as to an attorney's compliance or non-compliance with
this part shall be final and conclusive except insofar as the attorney for the government is afforded a right of review
by other provisions of law.

 This part is not intended to and does not create substantive rights on behalf of criminal or civil defendants, targets
or subjects of investigations, witnesses, counsel for represented parties or represented persons, or any other
person other than an attorney for the government, and shall not be a basis for dismissing criminal or civil charges
or proceedings against represented parties or for excluding relevant evidence in any proceeding in any court of the
United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Communications with represented parties and represented persons pursuant to this part are intended to constitute
communications that are ``authorized by law'' within the meaning of Rule 4.2 of the American Bar Association Model
Rules of Professional Conduct, DR 7&hyph;104(A)(1) of the ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, and analogous
state and local federal court rules. In addition, this part is intended to preempt and supersede the application of
state laws and rules and local federal court rules to the extent that they relate to contacts by attorneys for the government,
and those acting at their direction or under their supervision, with represented parties or represented persons
in criminal or civil law enforcement investigations or proceedings; it is designed to preempt the entire field of
rules concerning such contacts. When the Attorney General finds a willful violation of any of the rules in this part,
however, sanctions for the conduct that constituted a willful violation of this part may be applied, if warranted,
by the appropriate state disciplinary authority.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would amend the regulations: to set forth the acreage reduction percentage for each of the 1995
feed grain crops; to require that producers of malting barley comply with acreage reduction requirements to maintain
eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments; and to provide that a paid land diversion (PLD) program
will not be in effect. Producers who participate in the Feed Grain Acreage Reduction Program (ARP) would be eligible
for benefits such as price support loans and deficiency payments. This action is required by section 105B of the Agricultural
Act of 1949, as amended (the 1949 Act).

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is issued in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the USDA, this proposed
rule has been determined to be ``economically significant'' because it would have an annual effect on the economy
of more than $100 million and would materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, or loan programs or rights
and obligations of recipients thereof. Budget outlays for deficiency payments are expected to range from $1.5 to
$3.5 billion annually. This proposed rule would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the
economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments
or communities; would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by
another agency; and would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities,
or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is applicable to this proposed rule since the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) is required by section 105B(o) of the 1949 Act to request comments with respect to the subject
matter of this rule. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared, which determined that this regulation
will have no significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because the particular acreage reduction
percentages considered will not affect the paperwork, reporting, or compliance burdens of the small entities in
the program. CCC thus certifies that the rule will have no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities.

Statutory Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 105B of the 1949 Act, an ARP is required to be implemented for the 1995 crops of corn, grain
sorghum, or barley if it is determined that the total supply of each respective feed grain would otherwise be excessive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Land diversion payments also may be made to producers if needed to adjust the total national acreage of feed grains
to desirable goals. A PLD program is not being considered because, given the allowed ARP percentages, it is not needed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction to the respective
feed grain acreage base for the farm. In making such a determination, the number of acres placed into the agricultural
resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended,
must be taken into consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Producers who knowingly produce feed grains in excess of the respective permitted acreage for the farm plus any respective
feed grain acreage planted in accordance with the flexibility provisions are ineligible for loans and purchases
and all payments with respect to that crop on the farm. If an ARP program for the 1995 crop is in effect, the program must
be announced no later than September 30, 1994. Adjustments in the announced program may be made if it is determined
that there has been a significant change in the total supply of feed grains since the program was first announced. These
adjustments must be made no later than November 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 105B of the 1949 Act, not less than 60 days before the program is announced for a crop of feed
grains, proposals for public comment on various program options for the crop of feed grains are required to be set forth.
Each option must be accompanied by an analysis that includes the estimated planted acreage, production, domestic
and export use, ending stocks, season average producer price, program participation rate, and cost to the Federal
Government that would likely result from each option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the 1995 corn ARP, the Secretary will choose a specific ARP reduction percentage from within a range
established by the estimated ending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stocks-to-use (S/U) ratio for the 1994/95 corn marketing year. If it is estimated that the 1994/95 ending S/U ratio
in percentage terms will be:

(1) More than 25 percent, the ARP shall not be less than 10 percent or more than 20 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Equal to or less than 25 percent, the ARP may not be more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12.5 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The S/U for the 1994/95 marketing year is estimated to be 15.1 percent. Based on this estimate, the 1995 ARP may be not
more than 12.5 percent. In the case of grain sorghum and barley, the Secretary may choose a 1995 ARP percentage in the
range from 0 to 20 percent. For oats, the 1995 ARP is statutorily mandated not to exceed 0 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1104 of the Agricultural Reconciliation Act of 1990 provides that the acreage reduction factor for the 1995
crops of corn, grain sorghum, and barley may not be less than 7.5 percent unless the estimated corn S/U for the 1994/95
marketing year is less than 20 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently the S/U of corn for the 1993/94 corn marketing year is less than 20 percent. Thus, the minimum 7.5-percent-ARP
provision is not currently applicable. The final ARP decision process could consider higher ARP percentages up to
20 percent if the S/U exceeds 25 percent. The ARP options included in this analysis are the most likely possibilities,
based on May 1994 data. If ending stocks increase, due to weaker demand or higher than expected yields, and raise the
S/U ratio to 25 percent or higher, ARP levels between 12.5 and 20 percent may be considered before a final decision is
made. The 1995 ARP options considered are shown in table 1.

For grain sorghum and barley, ARP percentages higher than 5 percent are not considered because expected sorghum and
barley S/U's are low compared with historical levels. The 1994/95 grain sorghum S/U is forecast at 20.1, which with
the exceptions of 1991/92 and 1993/94, the lowest level since 1976/77 (17.3 percent). The 1994/95 barley S/U is forecast
at 29.1, a level reached only one other time since 1974/75. ARP levels above 5 percent would limit supplies of barley
and grain sorghum to the point of not allowing export and domestic needs to be met. However, ARP levels above 5 percent
will be considered when making the final ARP decision if feed grain supply and demand changes are large enough to warrant
their consideration.

Accordingly, comments are requested as to whether the 1995 acreage reduction percentage for: (1) Corn should be 0,
5, or 12.5 percent or any percentage less than 12.5 percent; (2) Grain sorghum should be 0 or 5 percent or any percentage
in the range of 0 to 20 percent; and (3) Barley should be 0 or 5 percent or any percentage in the range of 0 to 20 percent.
The final determination of these percentages will be set forth at 7 CFR part 1413. In accordance with section 105B(e)(2)(G)
of the 1949 Act, with respect to feed grains, the Secretary may exempt producers of malting barley, as a condition of
eligibility for feed grain loans, purchases, and payments, from complying with the acreage reduction requirements.
It is proposed that malting barley not be exempted from the feed grain acreage reduction requirements for the 1995
crop.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is seeking public comment on a proposed amendment to the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y. The proposed
amendment would permit a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary to discount any of its products or services
on condition that a customer obtain another product or service from that company or subsidiary or from any of its nonbank
affiliates, provided that all products offered in the package arrangement are separately available for purchase.
This exception would not apply when any product in the arrangement is offered by a bank. The board believes that this
will increase the efficiency with which banking organizations can deliver banking services.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1971, the Board applied these tying restrictions to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries as if
they were banks. 12 CFR 225.4(d)(1); 36 FR 10777, 10778 (1971).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 A prohibited tie-in occurs if a bank: (1) varies the consideration for a product or service (the ``tying product'')
on the condition that the customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank
or from any of its affiliates; or (2) as a condition for providing a customer a product or service, requires the customer
to purchase another product or service from the bank or from any of its affiliates.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 11, 1994, the Board requested public comment on proposed amendments to Regulation Y, including an extension
of the so-called traditional bank product exception of section 106 to package arrangements with affiliates. 59 FR
12202 (March 16, 1994). In addition to comments on the proposed rule, which is being made final in a separate document
published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Board received various requests for interpretation or extension of regulatory exceptions to the tying restrictions
imposed by section 106 and Regulation Y. In particular, commenters urged the Board to reconsider its extension of
the tying restrictions of section 106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering those requests, the Board has decided to propose an amendment to its anti-tying regulation to conform
it more closely to section 106 and its focus on tying by banks. Under the proposed rule, bank holding companies and their
nonbanking subsidiaries would be permitted to offer discounts on packaged products when: (1) Both the tying and tied
products
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 are offered by bank holding companies or their nonbanking subsidiaries_in other words, where no affiliated bank
is involved in the arrangement; and (2) both the tying and tied products are separately available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In cases that do not qualify for this (or some other) exception, the general restrictions of section 106 and Regulation
Y would continue to apply; for example, if the package arrangement involved a product offered by an affiliated bank,
the exception would not apply and the nonbanking subsidiary could only offer discount package arrangements involving
exclusively traditional bank products or securities brokerage services, under exceptions recently adopted by
the Board and to take effect in thirty days. The antitrust laws also would continue to apply in all cases.

 The ``tying'' product is the product whose consideration is being varied or whose availability is being conditioned.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that the proposed exception is consistent with the terms and purposes of section 106, is justified
by the competitive environment in which nonbanking subsidiaries generally operate, and is potentially beneficial
both to banking organizations and consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistency With Section 106 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By its terms, section 106 applies only when a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offers the tying product_that is, when a bank is varying the consideration or conditioning the availability of a product
in order to create an incentive for the customer to purchase another product from the bank or an affiliate. This coverage
was consistent with the stated purpose of section 106: To prevent banks from using their market power over certain
products to gain an unfair competitive advantage in other products. See, e.g., S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess.,
16 (1970) (section 106 was ``intended to provide specific statutory assurance that the use of the economic power of
a bank will not lead to a lessening of competition or unfair competitive practices''). The proposed exception would
apply only when nonbanks are offering the packaged products. Such arrangements are not covered by the terms of section
106; nor do they raise the specific concerns that section 106 was intended to address. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistency With Regulation Y 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tying restrictions of section 106 were imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 in conjunction
with an extension of new nonbanking powers to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The potential
for anticompetitive behavior by such subsidiaries_which were then uncommon_was uncertain pending implementation
of the Act, and the Board therefore adopted a prophylactic rule in applying the restrictions of section 106 to bank
holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Much has changed, however, since adoption of that rule. Competition in most financial markets has increased substantially
since 1971, and through its experience in the supervision of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, the
Board has been able to assess the role of nonbanking subsidiaries in those markets. The Board believes that neither
bank holding companies nor their nonbanking subsidiaries generally appear to possess sufficient market power in
the products that they offer to impair competition. For example, the ``laundry list'' activities in which bank holding
companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries are permitted to engage are generally conducted in competitive national
or regional markets that are characterized by large numbers of actual or potential competitors and low barriers to
entry.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In such markets, the potential for a market participant to gain a competitive advantage through tying is substantially
reduced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ``laundry list'' activities are specified by regulation. See 12 CFR 225.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, if the Board's proposal were adopted, ties involving bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries
would, as noted, continue to be restricted by the federal antitrust laws (primarily the Clayton and Sherman Acts)_the
same restrictions that bind their competitors. In addition, section 106 would continue to restrict tying by banks,
and the Board would continue to apply special restrictions to tying by a nonbank when the tied product is offered by
an affiliated bank. As a final protection, the Board would retain the authority to terminate or modify any exception
that resulted in anticompetitive practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Board is proposing to rescind its special restrictions on tying between nonbanks only where the
products are separately available and a discount is being offered.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These conditions prevent the conditioning of the availability of one product on the purchase of another and allow
consumers to compare prices. The Board recognizes that to the extent that the market for products offered by bank holding
companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries is competitive, these conditions should not be strictly necessary.
The Board seeks comment on whether these conditions should be retained as a precaution against any anti-competitive
practices. The Board also seeks comment on a clarification to the requirement of separate availability, applicable
to all the regulatory exceptions, that would provide that products must be separately available ``at competitive
prices.'' This amendment would clarify that if a product is available outside a package arrangement only at a non-competitive
price, it is not truly separately available.

 Under antitrust law, concerns over tying arrangements are substantially reduced where the buyer is free to take either
product by itself, even though the seller may also offer the two items as a unit at a single price.

Costs of Tying Restrictions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The special tying restrictions imposed on nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies not only appear to be unnecessary
to prevent those companies from gaining an unfair competitive advantage, but also place those companies at a competitive
disadvantage with other providers of the same products and services. As a result of Regulation Y's current prohibition,
a nonbanking company is generally prohibited from offering discounted packages of its own products or discounted
packages that include its own products and those of other affiliated nonbanking companies. Their competitors who
are not affiliated with banks are not similarly constrained. Several commenters in the Board's recent rulemaking
noted that brokerage firms and other nonbank competitors are offering the types of discounts currently prohibited
by Regulation Y, which are not generally illegal for purposes of the federal antitrust laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inability of nonbanks in a holding company structure to offer discounts not only diminishes their competitiveness
but also deprives their customers of an opportunity to receive discounts. The Board believes that under the proposed
rule, customers would be presented with more choices and potentially lower costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Congressional Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board notes that this proposed treatment of tying by nonbanking subsidiaries is consistent with recent Congressional
action in the tying area. In applying anti-tying restrictions to savings associations in the Garn-St. Germain Depository
Institutions Act, Public Law No. 97&hyph;320, section 331, 96 Stat. 1496, Congress closely paralleled section 106
in applying the restriction only when the tying product was offered by the savings association. An extension of the
restrictions to non-savings association affiliates of the type adopted by the Board was neither included by Congress
nor subsequently adopted by the Office of Thrift Supervision.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is withdrawing a previously published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) that proposed to amend the Federal Aviation Regulations to revise the airplane type certification standards
and operating rules. The proposed amendments would have required that future civil supersonic airplanes meet noise
limits consistent with those required for future civil subsonic airplanes. The FAA is postponing development of
a final rule because it cannot ensure that the final rule would be economically reasonable and technologically practical
at this time. The FAA will continue to gather technical information and analyze suggested recommendations for test
and measurement conditions.

 On October 30, 1986, the FAA published Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking No. 86&hyph;16 (51 FR 39663), announcing
its tentative intention to amend 14 CFR parts 36 and 91. The comment period for Notice No. 86&hyph;16 was reopened on
March 12, 1987 (52 FR 7618) to allow interested parties additional time to comment.

On May 30, 1990, the FAA published Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) No. 86&hyph;16 (55 FR 22020), proposing to
amend 14 CFR parts 36 and 91. These revisions were intended to aid the development of next-generation supersonic airplanes
by establishing a notice standard for supersonic airplanes that is consistent with noise limits for conventional
(subsonic) airplanes. In the NPRM, the FAA requested that the public comment on the following issues: (1) Requirement
that future supersonic airplanes (SST) meet noise limits consistent with those required for future subsonic airplanes,
(2) recommendations on test and measurement conditions and operational characteristics appropriate for future
SST's, and (3) cost of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After analyzing the comments received on the NPRM, the FAA has determined that further investigation and research
is necessary before developing the final rule. The FAA will continue to gather technical information and analyze
suggested recommendations for test and measurement conditions. A statement concerning FAA policy on this matter
is published elsewhere in this issue of the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) is considering amending its regulations regarding the valuation of gas produced
from Indian leases to ensure that Indian mineral lessors receive the maximum revenues from mineral resources on their
land consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's (Secretary) trust responsibility and lease terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most Indian leases provide that the value of production for royalty purposes be determined by the Secretary. In making
this determination, the Secretary must consider his trust responsibility. In the exercise of this responsibility,
value in the discretion of the Secretary may be determined by taking the highest of several values. This notice describes
several alternatives to establish these values and solicits comments before publishing proposed new regulations
governing the value of gas production from Indian lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MMS is not currently proposing changes to the oil valuation regulations for Indian leases. The MMS may consider
changes following study of oil valuation for Indian leases.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
All Indian leases contain provisions for the determination of royalty obligations. Some Indian leases or agreements
negotiated under the 1982 Indian Mineral Development Act contain explicit methodologies for determining royalty
obligations. The MMS does not intend to alter these express valuation methodologies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Most Indian leases were entered into under the authority of earlier statutes, and these leases reserve to the Secretary
considerable discretion in determining value for royalty purposes. This Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
is intended to solicit comments on new methodologies being considered to establish value for these leases. Comments
that are received in response to this Advance Notice will be considered in the development of a proposed rulemaking
that will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at a future date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most Indian leases also provide that royalty obligations be based on the value of hydrocarbon substances produced
and saved. A royalty obligation is incurred when hydrocarbon substances are produced and saved and not solely as the
result of a sale.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(c) of a standard Indian lease covers leasee rental and royalty payment requirements and states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Rental and royalty. To pay, beginning with the date of approval of the lease by the Secretary of the Interior or his
duly authorized representative, a rental of $1.25 per acre per annum in advance during the continuance hereof, the
rental so paid for any one year to be credited on the royalty for that year, together with a royalty of 162/3 percent of
the value or amount of all oil, gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and
saved from the land leased herein, save and except oil, and/or gas used by the lessee for development and operation
purposes on said lease, which oil or gas shall be royalty free. During the period of supervision, ``value'' for the
purposes hereof may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be calculated on the basis of the highest price paid or offered
(whether calculated on the basis of short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion of the oil
of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold
from the field where the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable product less the content
of foreign substances as determined by the oil and gas supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the
sale of said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of
such value. When paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly on the last day of the calendar month
following the calendar month in which produced; when royalty on oil produced is paid in kind, such royalty oil shall
be delivered in tanks provided by the lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless otherwise
agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be required by the lessor: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Provided
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the lessee shall not be required to hold such royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar
month in which said oil is produced: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
And provided further
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, that the lessee shall be in no manner responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil in storage caused
by acts of God. All rental and royalty payments, except as provided in section 4(c) shall be made by check or draft drawn
on a solvent bank, open for the transaction of business on the day the check or draft is issued, to the payee designated
by the Area Director. All such rental and royalty payments shall be mailed to the oil and gas supervisor for transmittal
to the payee designated by the Area Director. It is understood that in determining the value for royalty purposes of
products, such as natural gasoline, that are derived from treatment of gas, a reasonable allowance for the cost of
manufacture shall be made, such allowance to be two-thirds of the value of the marketable product unless otherwise
determined by the Secretary of the Interior on application of the lessee or on his own initiative, and that royalty
will be computed on the value of gas or casinghead gas, or on the products thereof (such as residue gas, natural gasoline,
propane, butane, etc.), whichever is the greater.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In conjunction with the lease terms, the valuation of gas production from Indian leases is subject to the regulations
at 30 CFR Part 206. The present regulations govern the valuation of production from both Federal and Indian (Tribal
and allotted) leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Oklahoma) (Revision of Gas Royalty Valuation
Regulations and Related Topics; Final Rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 15, 1988 (53 FR 1230).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS now believes that it may be able to better perform the trust responsibilities of the United States with respect
to the administration of Indian oil and gas leases by issuing separate regulations for the valuation of gas from these
leases. Also, MMS believes that it could provide an improved regulatory framework in which these lease terms can be
strictly enforced while economizing on the information needed by a lessee. MMS is seeking to adopt valuation procedures
that could be compiled with by the lessee in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is obligated to act as a fiduciary in the administration of Indian oil and gas leases. As a fiduciary,
charged with supervising the disposition of nonrenewable resources from Indian lands, the Secretary must ensure
that Indians receive the maximum revenues from mineral resources on their lands. To ensure maximum revenues, the
value of production for royalty purposes from an Indian lease should be determined considering the highest values
provided by the terms of the standard lease, quoted above. MMS believes this is consistent with the terms of these Indian
oil and gas leases, with statutes delegating to the Secretary the administration of Indian affairs, with the statutes
governing Indian oil and gas leases, with the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), with court
decisions providing judicial guidance in the interpretation and administration of Indian oil and gas leases, and
with the law of trusts and fiduciary operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS has considered that maximizing royalty revenues from Indian leases might affect the economics of mineral resource
development and believes that this should not result in the reduction of the value of production for royalty purposes.
This issue should be examined in the context of an adjustment of lease terms by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian
lessor.

II. Current Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current valuation regulations incorporate the terms of the standard Indian leases in the ways listed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The value of production is never less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee. This provision is contained
in valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.102(h), 206.152(h), and 206.153(h), which state:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no circumstances shall the value of production, for royalty
purposes, be less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production, less applicable allowances
determined pursuant to this subpart.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) The value of production will be the higher of the major portion value and the otherwise applicable value. This provision
is contained in valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.102(a)(2)(i), 206.152(a)(3)(i), and 206.153(a)(3)(i), which
state:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For any Indian leases which provide that the Secretary may consider the highest price paid or offered for a major portion
of production (major portion) in determining value for royalty purposes, if data are available to compute a major
portion, MMS will, where practicable, compare the value determined in accordance with this section with the major
portion. The value to be used in determining the value of production, for royalty purposes, shall be the higher of those
two values.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) The value of production will be the greater of (1) the combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue gas and
gas plant products resulting from processing the gas, or (2) the value, for royalty purposes, of the gas prior to processing
determined in accordance with 30 CFR &sect;&sect;206.152 and 206.155.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary's responsibility to determine value for royalty purposes of production from Indian lands has not changed,
although the industry and marketplace have changed dramatically over the years. One of the objectives MMS hopes to
achieve is to develop a set of regulations to permit the Secretary to discharge this responsibility in an environment
of continuing and accelerating change in the industry and the marketplace. The trust responsibility of the Secretary
and the changing marketplace require that the Secretary develop flexible valuation methodologies for Indian production
that can be complied with accuracy and on time. MMS seeks to improve several areas of Indian gas valuation including:
major portion analysis, accounting for comparison (dual accounting), and Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) contracts.
Following is a discussion of each of these areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Major Portion Value
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(c) of most Indian leases provides that value may be based on the highest price paid or offered for a major portion
of oil or gas or similar substances. Many lessees have stated that there are difficulties encountered in complying
with major portion valuation requirements and the timeliness of major portion analyses performed by MMS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indian mineral owners assert the median pricing methodology in the present regulations does not always achieve the
highest price paid for a major portion of production provided by the lease terms. Since the Secretary has considerable
discretion in establishing value for royalty purposes, the Secretary has been urged to be more flexible in establishing
major portion methodologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Dual Accounting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(c) of most Indian leases provides for ``dual accounting''_the requirement to pay royalties on the greater
of the combined value of the residue gas and plant products resulting from processing the gas or the value of the gas
prior to processing. Dual accounting is required whether gas is sold prior to processing or after processing. In either
case, the lessees may have difficulty in gathering the data necessary to comply, which delays the proper payment of
royalties to the Indian lessors. Improvement in the regulations that will permit lessees to timely and completely
comply with the lease's dual accounting requirement is desirable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Percentage-of-Proceeds (POP) Contracts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This class of contracts for the sale of gas from Indian leases presents a different problem in determining value for
royalty purposes. Under a POP contract, the seller is paid based upon a value determined after processing. As the name
given to this class of contract suggests, the seller is paid an agreed-upon percentage of the purchaser's proceeds
from the sale of residue gas and usually a different and much smaller percentage of the proceeds from the sale of gas
plant products. Lessees have objected to the dual accounting requirement for gas sold pursuant to a POP contract because
of a lack of wellhead sales. Regulations that permit lessees to timely and accurately comply with POP contract valuation
requirements are desirable.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary MMS's goal is to develop simplified methods for determining the highest price paid or offered for a major
portion of like-quality production from the field or area, for determining the greater of the processed value or the
unprocessed value, and for properly valuing POP contract production, on a more contemporaneous basis. This would
simplify the accounting and enhance the administrative workability for both Tribal and MMS royalty personnel as
well as the oil and gas industry. It would allow more contemporaneous automated accounting comparisons and reduce

IV. Description of Alternatives and Solicitation of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS invites specific comments on the following alternatives that is currently considering for valuation under the
major portion and dual accounting requirements for gas produced, saved, or sold from tribal and allotted Indian Lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Major Portion Scenarios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Use of Gas Price Indices
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS is considering using published indices of natural gas prices as a means to determine the price at which a major portion
of gas is sold from a given field or area. It is contemplated that any index or indices used would be widely used by industry,
have a history of publication, and generally be expected to continue to be published. It is likewise contemplated
that any regulation that uses published indices would provide for the use of substitute indices if necessary. MMS
is aware that gas-index-price-based major portion systems are currently being successfully utilized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS is soliciting comments on what publications are most widely used by industry for gas price indices. MMS also seeks
input from companies that are successfully using gas price index-based formulas to determine the major portion value,
and the ways the gas price indices are used to arrive at a value. MMS is also particularly interested in perspectives
regarding the extent to which published prices reflect actual values of production, and perspectives regarding
the accuracy of published prices and indices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS would also appreciate comments on the extent to which the use of published prices would promote: The certainty
and reliability of payments, the timeliness of royalty reporting, ease of compliance, enforceability, and the reduction
of costs to both industry and government.

(2) Major Portion Analysis Using Price Data Reported to Indian Tribes and States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS has used gas prices obtained from the Oklahoma Tax Commission severance tax report to do a major portion calculation
for allotted Indian leases in the Anadarko area of Oklahoma. MMS requests comments on the feasibility of MMS doing
the major portion calculation using pricing data obtained from Tribes, States, or other outside sources (that have
information available).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Major Portion Analysis Using Price Data Reported on the Report of Sales and Royalty Remittance (Form MMS&hyph;2014).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Information reported on Form MMS&hyph;2014 has been used to do major portion calculations for gas produced from the
Southern Ute Tribal and Allotted Indian leases. MMS requests comments on the feasibility of MMS calculating the major
portion price from data on Form MMS&hyph;2014.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Requirement That All Purchasers Provide Sales Data to MMS
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS is considering implementing a new regulation (under the authority of FOGRMA) that would require all purchasers
of Federal and/or Indian gas in fields or areas in which Indian production occurs to provide volume and pricing data
to MMS. MMS would then calculate major portion prices and provide these to the lessees. MMS seeks comments on the feasibility
of such an approach.

(5) Flexibility To Negotiate a Method to do a Major Portion Analysis on a Case-By-Case Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS is considering adding new regulatory language that would allow lessees the flexibility to negotiate with Indian
Tribes and allottees a method of fulfilling the value of a major portion of production from a field or area. MMS seeks
comments on the feasibility of such an approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) Dual Accounting Scenarios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Wellhead Sale of Gas and the Gas Is Processed (Seller Not Owner in Gas Plant)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this scenario, the lessee typically sells gas prior to processing in a gas plant. The lessee should know the gross
proceeds accruing under the sale of gas at the wellhead. To fulfill the dual accounting requirement, the lessee is
also required to obtain the actual sales values of the residue gas and gas plant products after processing. Lessees
have made MMS aware of the difficulty, in some instances, in obtaining all of the information necessary to determine
accurately the value of production. On July 27, 1992, MMS issued a letter to payors describing a theoretical dual accounting
method that can be used to approximate the value of gas after processing. Although this method has helped, MMS has been
made aware that there are still problems in obtaining information that is both timely and accurate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the process of obtaining all of the information (such as gas plant efficiencies, processing charges,
plant fuel and flare volumes, and fractionation costs) necessary to accurately do dual accounting, MMS is considering
the following alternatives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;MMS could draft regulations requiring owners of plants that process Federal and/or Indian gas to report the
processing information directly either to MMS, the lessee, or both.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;MMS could attempt to obtain information on plants that process Indian gas from State agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS requests comments on the feasibility of requiring plant owners to make processing information available to lessees
or MMS. MMS also welcomes suggestions for any other possible alternatives for obtaining this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS is also considering establishing a single basin-wide processing allowance that would be used by all lessees or
could be used when the lessee does not have actual processing plant information. MMS requests comments on using basin-wide
allowances that the MMS would periodically calculate and publish.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Gas Is Sold at the Tailgate of a Gas Plant
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this situation, the lessee should have all of the data pertaining to the sale of the processed gas. To fulfill the
dual accounting requirement, the lessee must determine the value of the unprocessed gas at the wellhead. When there
is no sale of gas at the wellhead, the wellhead unit value ($/MMBtu) of the gas for royalty purposes could be determined
by using: (1) Gross proceeds under arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby fields
or areas; (2) the unit value of the residue gas; (3) gas price indices posted in publicly available national publications;
or (4) the price arrived at by performing a major portion analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS seeks comments on the availability of information and the accuracy of the above methods in determining the value
for royalty purposes of unprocessed gas at the wellhead. MMS further seeks comments on what specific publications
are used by industry for index prices. MMS also seeks comments on using the highest price in the range, the index price,
the average price, or some combination of prices if index pricing were used in dual accounting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Gas Is Sold Under a POP Contract
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS requests comments on the following methods of determining value of gas at the wellhead under a POP contract when
doing dual accounting:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Gross proceeds under the POP contract,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The unit value of the residue gas,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Gas price indices posted in publicly available national publications,

(iv) The price arrived at by performing a major portion analysis; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Prices received under arm's-length wellhead sales in the field or area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MMS also seeks suggestions on other possible methods to arrive at a value of unprocessed gas at the wellhead for comparison
purposes under dual accounting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Percentage Increase to Value in Lieu of Dual Accounting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In situations where lessees have made a reasonable effort to do dual accounting but nonetheless cannot establish
an accurate comparison of values, MMS is considering allowing a percentage increase to the otherwise determined
value of production in lieu of dual accounting. Analysis has shown that the difference between the greater of the combined
value of the residue gas and plant products resulting from processing the gas or the value of the gas prior to processing
has exceeded 40 percent of the lower value in some cases. MMS seeks comments on the feasibility of applying a percentage
increase and the amount of such an increase to comply with dual accounting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Integration of Major Portion Scenarios and Dual Accounting Scenarios
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MMS seeks comments on how to integrate any selected scenarios on major portion with the scenarios on dual accounting.
For example, one way to integrate these is the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the index scenario is selected for major portion analysis and the percentage increase is selected for dual accounting,
then a way to integrate these concepts is to apply the percentage increase to the higher of index or gross proceeds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a February 11, 1993, State submittal
requesting a revision to the Illinois State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO). The revision pertains
to a site-specific emission limit for a iron foundry operated by General Motors Corporation (GMC) and located adjacent
to Interstate 74 at G Street in Vermilion County, Illinois. Vermilion County has been designated by USEPA as ``unclassifiable/attainment''
for carbon monoxide. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the USEPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because USEPA views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the
approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final
rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If USEPA receives adverse comments,
the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule
based on this proposed rule. USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this notice. Any parties interested
in commenting on this notice should do so at this time.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Alabama for the
purpose of establishing an emission statement program. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, the EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views
this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rational for the approval
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule
will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed
rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on
this document should do so at this time.

 NMFS is proposing to designate critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Halophila johnsonii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Because the subject matter of this proposed rule is closely
related to a proposal published on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48326), to list Johnson's seagrass as a threatened species,
NMFS is announcing a public hearing to consider both proposed rules. NMFS is also reopening the comment period for
the proposed rule to list Johnson's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seagrass. The hearing will be held September 20, 1994, in Vero Beach, FL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Johnson's seagrass is found on the east coast of Florida from Sebastian Inlet to central Biscayne Bay. Within this
range, five areas in proximity to Sebastian Inlet, Ft. Pierce Inlet, St. Lucie Inlet, Jupiter Inlet and Lake Worth
Inlet are proposed for critical habitat. In addition, the proposed critical habitat designation identifies those
physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may
require special management consideration or protection. The economic and other impacts resulting from this critical
habitat designation, over and above those arising from the listing of the species under the ESA, are expected to be
minimal. The designation of proposed critical habitat provides explicit notice to Federal agencies and the public
that these areas and features are vital to the conservation of the species.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NMFS published a proposed rule to list Johnson's seagrass as a threatened species on September 15, 1993 (58 FR 48326).
Critical habitat was not proposed for designation at that time because the analysis of impacts of the proposed designation,
as required by section 4(b)(2) of the ESA, had not been completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has now completed an environmental assessment (EA), pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),
to evaluate both the environmental and economic impacts of the proposed critical habitat designation (See ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed designation identifies those physical and biological features of the habitat that are essential to
the conservation of the species and that may require special management consideration or protection. The direct
economic and other impacts resulting from designating critical habitat, over and above those that result from listing
the species, are expected to be minimal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the ESA as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) Essential
to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and
(ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species *&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination
by the Secretary that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.'' Areas outside the current range
of a species can only be designated if a designation limited to the species' present distribution would be inadequate
to ensure the conservation of the species. The term conservation, as defined in section 3(3) of the ESA, means ``*&blank;*&blank;*
to use and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species
to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria to be considered in designating critical habitat are specified under 50 CFR 424.12. When designating
critical habitat, NMFS considers physical and biological features that are essential to the conservation of the
species and that may require special management consideration or protection, including but not limited to the following:
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; (2) food, water, air, light, minerals or
other nutritional or physiological requirements; (3) cover or shelter; (4) sites for breeding, reproduction or
rearing of offspring; and, generally, (5) habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of
the historic geographical and ecological distributions of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NMFS must list the known physical and biological features (primary constituent elements) within the
designated area(s) that are essential to the conservation of the species and that may require special management
considerations or protection. These essential features may include, but are not limited to, food resources, water
quality or quantity and vegetation and sediment types and stability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Consideration of Economic and Other Factors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic, environmental and other impacts of a designation must also be evaluated and considered. NMFS must identify
present and future activities that may adversely modify the proposed critical habitat or be affected by a designation.
An area may be excluded from a critical habitat designation if NMFS determines that the overall benefits of exclusion
outweigh the benefits of designation, unless the exclusion will result in the extinction of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impacts considered in this analysis are only those incremental impacts that specifically result from designating
critical habitat, above the economic and other impacts attributable to listing the species. These incremental impacts
are expected to be minimal (See Significance of Designating Critical Habitat section). In general, the designation
of critical habitat duplicates and reinforces the substantive protection resulting from the listing itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impacts attributable to listing include those resulting from the taking prohibitions under section 9 and associated
regulations. With respect to fish and wildlife, ``taking'' as defined in the ESA includes harm to a listed species.
Harm can occur through destruction or modification of habitat (whether or not designated as critical) that significantly
impairs essential behaviors, including breeding, feeding or sheltering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to plants, section 9 of the ESA makes it unlawful for any person subject to U.S. jurisdiction to ``remove
and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy any
such species on any such area; or remove, cut, dig up, or damage or destroy any such species on any other area in knowing
violation of any law or regulation of any state or in the course of any violation of a state criminal trespass law.''
Although this provision does not prohibit takings, such as harm or harassment of a species of fish or wildlife, it does
provide protection for plants in areas under Federal jurisdiction and under state laws. As with the takings prohibition
for fish and wildlife, these protections are triggered when a species is listed. Therefore, generally, the critical
habitat designation will duplicate these protections. This is particularly true with respect to acts that ``remove,
cut, dig up or damage or destroy listed plants in knowing violation of any law or regulation of any state.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Impacts attributable to listing also include those resulting from the responsibility of all Federal agencies under
section 7 to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize endangered or threatened species. An action could
be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species through the destruction or adverse modification
of its habitat, whether or not that habitat has been designated as critical.

Significance of Designating Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The designation of critical habitat does not, in itself, restrict state or private activities within the area. A critical
habitat designation contributes to conservation of the species primarily by identifying critically important
areas and describing the features within the areas that are essential to the species, thus alerting public and private
entities to the importance of the area. Under the ESA, the only direct impact of a critical habitat designation is through
the provisions of section 7. Section 7 applies only to actions with Federal involvement and does not affect state or
private activities unless there is Federal involvement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the section 7 provisions, a designation of critical habitat would require Federal agencies to ensure that any
action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy or adversely modify the designated critical habitat.
Activities that adversely modify critical habitat are defined as those actions that ``appreciably diminish the
value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery'' of the species (50 CFR 402.02). However, if no critical
habitat has been designated, Federal agencies still must ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the
continued existence of the listed species. Activities that jeopardize a species are defined as those actions that
``reasonably would be expected, directly or indirectly, to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival
and recovery'' of the species (50 CFR 402.02). Using these definitions, activities that destroy or adversely modify
critical habitat also are likely to jeopardize the species. Therefore, the protection provided by a critical habitat
designation usually only duplicates the protection provided under the section 7 jeopardy provision. Critical habitat
may provide additional benefits to a species where areas outside of the species' current range have been designated.
In these cases, it is expected that Federal agencies would consult on actions occurring in these areas for which they
would otherwise not need to consult.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to the Federal agencies as to when consultation under
section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals
of a listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present). The
critical habitat designation, describing the essential features of the habitat, also assists in determining which
activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 (i.e., activities that may affect essential
features of the designated area). For example, disposal of waste material in water adjacent to a critical habitat
area may affect an essential feature of the designated habitat (water quality) and would be subject to the provisions
of section 7 of the ESA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical habitat designation also assists Federal agencies in planning future actions, since the designation
establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations. This
is particularly true in cases where there are alternative areas that would provide for the conservation of the species.
With a designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between projects and endangered or threatened species
can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another indirect benefit of designating critical habitat is that it helps focus Federal, state and private conservation
and management efforts in those areas. Recovery efforts may address special considerations needed in critical habitat
areas, including conservation regulations to restrict private as well as Federal activities. The economic and other
impacts of these actions would be considered at the time of proposal, and, therefore, are not considered in the critical
habitat designation process. Other Federal, state and local laws or regulations, such as zoning or wetlands protection,
may also provide special protection for critical habitat areas.

Process for Designating Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Developing a proposal for critical habitat designation involves three main considerations. First, the biological
needs of the species are evaluated and essential habitat areas and features are identified. If there are alternative
areas that would provide for the conservation of the species, these alternatives are also identified. Second, the
need for special management considerations or protection of the area(s) or features is evaluated. Finally, the probable
economic and other impacts of designating these essential areas as ``critical habitat'' are evaluated. After considering
the requirements of the species, the need for special management, and the impacts of the designation, the proposed
critical habitat is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for comment. The final critical habitat designation, considering comments on the proposal and impacts assessment,
should be published within 1 year of the proposal. Section 4 (a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the maximum extent
prudent and determinable, NMFS designate critical habitat concurrently with a determination that a species is endangered
or threatened. Final critical habitat designations may be revised, using the same process, as new data become available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A description of the essential habitat, need for special management considerations, and impacts of designating
critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass, as well as the proposed action, are described in the following sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Essential Habitat of Johnson's Seagrass
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The biology of Johnson's seagrass is discussed in the proposed rule to list the species as threatened (58 FR 48326,
September 15, 1993) and includes information on the status of the species, its life history characteristics and habitat
requirements, as well as projects, activities and other factors affecting the species. The current status of Johnson's
seagrass is presented in the EA prepared for this critical habitat designation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The physical habitat that supports Johnson's seagrass includes both shallow intertidal as well as deeper subtidal
zones. The species prospers and is able to colonize and maintain stable populations either in water that is clear and
deep (2&hyph;5 m) or in water that is shallow and turbid. In tidal channels, it inhabits coarse sand substrates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on published reports and discussions with seagrass experts, the distributional range of Johnson's seagrass
is limited to the east coast of Florida from central Biscayne Bay (25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;45
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.) to Sebastian Inlet (27
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;50
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; N. lat.). There have been no reports of healthy populations of this species outside the presently known range.
Although the species occurs throughout the Indian River Lagoon and Lake Worth, the five specific areas proposed for
critical habitat encompass the largest known contiguous populations of Johnson's seagrass. While a population
within Biscayne Bay has been confirmed by literature and observation, it is discontinuous from the other areas where
the species is found, and the area has not been studied or delineated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The species is patchily distributed within its range. The dimensions of patches range from a few square centimeters
to approximately 327 square meters. The survival of the species likely depends on maintaining its existing viable
populations, especially the areas where the larger patches are found. The Sebastian Inlet population is believed
to be the northern limit of its distribution and includes the largest known patch of Johnson's seagrass. The other
areas proposed for critical habitat designation represent the core range of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spread of the species into new areas is limited by its reproductive potential. Johnson's seagrass possesses only
female flowers; thus vegetative propagation, most likely through asexual branching, appears to be its only means
of reproduction and dispersal. If an established community is disturbed, regrowth and reestablishment is extremely
unlikely. If extirpated from an area, it is doubtful that the species would be capable of repopulation. This species'
method of reproduction impedes its ability to increase distribution as establishment of new vegetation requires
considerable stability in environmental conditions and protection from human-induced disturbances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the best available information, the essential features of the areas proposed for critical habitat designation
include adequate (1) water quality; (2) salinity levels; (3) water transparency; (4) and stable, unconsolidated
sediments that are free from physical disturbance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for Special Management Consideration or Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has determined that the essential areas and features described in the previous section are at risk and may require
special management consideration or protection. Special management may be required because of the following activities:
(1) Vessel traffic and the resulting propeller dredging and anchor mooring; (2) maintenance dredging; (3) dock and
marina construction; (4) water pollution; and (5) land use practices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities associated with recreational boat traffic account for the majority of human use associated with the proposed
critical habitat areas. The destruction of the benthic community due to boating activities, propeller dredging,
anchor mooring and dock and marina construction was observed at all sites during a study by NMFS from 1990&hyph;1992.
These activities severely disrupt the benthic habitat, breaching root systems and severing rhizomes and significantly
reducing the viability of the benthic community. Propeller dredging and anchor mooring in shallow areas is a major
disturbance to even the most robust seagrasses. This destruction is expected to worsen with the predicted increase
in boating activity (Pat Rose, Florida Department of Natural Resources, personal communication). Trampling of
seagrass beds, a secondary effect of recreational boating, also contributes to disturbing seagrass habitat. Populations
of Johnson's seagrass inhabiting shallow water close to inlets where vessel traffic is concentrated will be most
affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The constant sedimentation patterns in and around inlets require frequent maintenance dredging, which could either
directly remove essential seagrass habitat or indirectly affect it by redistributing sediments, burying plants
and destabilizing the bottom structure. Altering benthic topography or burying the plants may remove them from the
photic zone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreased water transparency caused by suspended sediments, water color and chlorophylls could have significant
detrimental effects on the distribution and abundance of the deeper water populations of Johnson's seagrass. Evidence
from a distribution survey in Hobe and Jupiter Sounds indicates that the abundance of this seagrass diminishes in
the more turbid interior portion of the lagoon where reduced photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) limits photosynthesis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other areas of concern include seagrass beds located in proximity to rivers and canal mouths where low salinity, highly
colored water is discharged. Freshwater discharge into areas adjacent to seagrass beds may provoke physiological
stress upon the plants by reducing the salinity levels. Additionally, colored waters released into these areas reduce
the amount of sunlight necessary for photosynthesis by rapidly attenuating shorter wavelengths of PAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, continuing and increasing degradation of water quality due to increased land use and water management threatens
the welfare of seagrass communities. Nutrient overenrichment caused by inorganic and organic nitrogen and phosphorous
loading via urban and agricultural land run-off stimulates increased algal growth that may smother Johnson's seagrass,
shade rooted vegetation and diminish the oxygen content of the water. Low oxygen conditions have a demonstrated negative
impact on seagrasses and associated communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special consideration and protection for these and other habitat features will be evaluated during the section 7
process and in development and implementation of a recovery plan. If adequate protection cannot be provided through
consultation or through the recovery planning process, separate management actions with binding requirements
may be considered.

Federal Activities that May Impact Essential Habitat and Features
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A wide range of activities funded, authorized or carried out by Federal agencies may affect the essential habitat
requirements of Johnson's seagrass. These include authorization by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for beach nourishment,
dredging and related activities including construction of docks and marinas; actions by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to manage freshwater discharges into waterways; regulation of vessel traffic by the U.S. Coast
Guard; authorization of oil and gas exploration by the Minerals Management Service; management of national refuges
and protected species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; management of vessel traffic and other activities by
the U.S. Navy; authorization of state coastal zone management plans by NOAA's National Ocean Service, and management
of commercial fishing and protected species by NMFS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Expected Impacts of Designating Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 7 of the ESA, Federal agencies are required to ensure that actions that they authorize, fund or carry
out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or to result in the destruction or adverse
modification of listed species' critical habitat. Also, takings of Johnson's seagrass will be prohibited under
the proposed regulations issued to list the species as threatened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This designation will identify specific habitat areas that have been determined to be essential for the conservation
of Johnson's seagrass and that may be in need of special management considerations or protection. It will require
Federal agencies to evaluate their activities with respect to the critical habitat of this species and to consult
with NMFS pursuant to section 7 of the ESA before engaging in any action that may affect the critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, if Johnson's seagrass is listed as proposed, Federal agencies active within the range of the species will
be required to consult with NMFS if projects and activities they authorize, fund or otherwise carry out may affect
the species, regardless of whether critical habitat is designated. Therefore, it is unlikely that additional consultations
will result from designating critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, it is not likely that designation of critical habitat for Johnson's seagrass will have any additional
adverse economic impacts on Federal, state or private activities beyond those that would occur as a result of listing
the species. As discussed in the section on activities that may impact essential habitat and features, the Federal
activities that may affect critical habitat are the same activities that may affect the species itself. For plants,
this is particularly true when analyzing the impacts of designating critical habitat. For example, the activities
that affect water quality, an essential feature of critical habitat, also will be considered in terms of how they affect
the species itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should this proposed designation of critical habitat be adopted, Federal agencies will continue to engage in section
7 consultations to determine if the actions they authorize, fund or carry out are likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of Johnson's seagrass; however, with designation, they would also need to address explicitly impacts
to the species' critical habitat. This is not expected to affect materially the scope of future consultations or result
in greater economic impacts, since the impacts to Johnson's seagrass habitat will already be considered in section
7 consultations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic costs to be considered in a critical habitat designation are the incremental costs of designation above
the economic impacts attributable to listing or attributable to authorities other that the ESA. NMFS has determined
that there are no incremental net costs for areas within the species' current distribution, and no areas outside the
current range are proposed for critical habitat designation.

Proposed Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on available information, NMFS proposes to designate critical habitat that is considered essential for the
survival and recovery of Johnson's seagrass and that may require special management consideration or protection.
The critical habitat designation proposed by this rule includes the largest contiguous areas that are currently
utilized by Johnson's seagrass.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Johnson's seagrass is found throughout the Indian River Lagoon, Lake Worth and in some areas of Biscayne
Bay, NMFS is not proposing to include these areas in the proposed designation until more information is available
and the areas are delineated, and it can be determined that these areas meet the requirements for designation as critical
habitat. For the same reason, NMFS is not including in the proposed designation any areas outside the species' currently
known geographical area. NMFS has concluded that, at this time, proper management of the essential features of the
areas in proximity to the five inlets will be sufficient to provide for the survival and recovery of this species. If
the species is listed as proposed, Federal activities in any area occupied by Johnson's seagrass would be subject
to the section 7 consultation process whether or not the area has been designated as critical habitat. In addition,
NMFS may reconsider this evaluation and propose additional areas for critical habitat at any time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five areas proposed for critical habitat designation include the intertidal and subtidal areas in proximity
to five inlets on the east coast of Florida. These areas are within 3 to 5 kilometers of the inlet and experience regular
tidal flushing with salinity greater than 15 ppt. Maps are provided for reference purposes to guide Federal agencies
and other interested parties in locating the general boundaries of the proposed critical habitat. They do not constitute
the definition of the boundaries of critical habitat. Persons must refer to the regulations at 50 CFR 226.91 for the
actual boundaries of the designated critical habitat.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to the
Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that the proposed rule, if adopted, would not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities since it is primarily Federal agencies that
will be affected. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (NOAA) has determined that the proposed designation is consistent to

 The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that a fishery management plan or amendment
prepared by a fishery management council be submitted to the Secretary for review and approval, disapproval, or partial
disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary, upon receiving the document, immediately publish
a notice that the amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider public comment
in determining approvability of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amendment 7 proposes to: (1) Increase the domestic quota for royal red shrimp harvested from the exclusive economic
zone of the Gulf of Mexico and eliminate the total allowable level of foreign fishing for royal red shrimp from that
area; (2) revise the definition of overfishing for royal red shrimp and provide a procedure for updating maximum sustainable
yield of royal red shrimp; (3) define overfishing for white shrimp; (4) establish procedures for revising the overfishing
indices for brown, white, and pink shrimp when new data become available; and (5) specify actions to be taken if overfishing
for brown, white, pink, or royal red shrimp occurs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The groundfish fishery in the U.S. BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according
to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management
Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, has determined that the initial TACs specified for sablefish in the Bering Sea
subarea (BS), for sablefish and the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category in the Aleutian Islands subarea
(AI), and for Atka mackerel in the Central and Western Aleutian Districts, need to be supplemented from the non-specific
reserve to continue operations and account for prior harvest. Therefore, in accordance with &sect;675.20(b), NMFS
proposes to apportion from the reserve to TACs for the following species: (1) For the BS_81 metric tons (mt) to sablefish;
(2) for the AI_420 mt to sablefish, and 850 mt to the sharpchin/northern rockfish species category; (3) for the Central
Aleutian District_6,679 mt to Atka mackerel; and (4) for the Western Aleutian District_1,500 mt to Atka mackerel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed apportionments are consistent with &sect;675.20(a)(2)(i) and do not result in overfishing of a target
species or the ``other species'' category because the revised TACs are equal to or less than specifications of acceptable
biological catch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;675.24(c)(1)(i), the proposed apportionment of the BS sablefish is allocated 41 mt to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 40 mt to vessels using trawl gear. Pursuant to &sect;675.24(c)(1)(ii), the proposed
apportionment of the AI sablefish is allocated 315 mt to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 105 mt to vessels
using trawl gear.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the Laguna Mountains skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and quino checkerspot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) butterflies as endangered species throughout their respective ranges in southwestern California and northwestern
Baja California, Mexico pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Laguna Mountains skipper
occupies two montane meadow habitats in a very restricted range within San Diego County, California. The quino checkerspot
is locally distributed in sunny openings within chaparral and coastal sage shrublands in portions of Riverside County,
California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. These species are threatened by one or more of the following
factors: Grazing, urban development, collection by lepidopterists and other human disturbance, stochastic events,
and the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms to provide for their conservation. This proposed rule, if made
final, would extend protection under the Act to these species.

The Laguna Mountains skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a small butterfly within the skipper family (Hesperiidae). It is about 3 centimeters (cm) (1 inch) in length and
is distinguished from the rural skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. ruralis ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by extensive white wing markings that give it an overall appearance of white rather than mostly black (Scott 1981).
The Laguna Mountains skipper is found in wet montane meadow habitats. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is one of two recognized subspecies of the rural skipper, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Boisduval). Scott (1981) first described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis lagunae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from a collection made in 1956 by F. Thorne in the Laguna Mountains of San Diego County California, based upon population
isolation and color differentiation. The Laguna Mountains skipper is restricted to the Laguna Mountains and Mount
Palomar in San Diego County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other subspecies of the rural skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) ranges from the mountains of British Columbia and Alberta south to central California, Nevada, Utah, and northern
Colorado (J. Brown, Dudek and Associates, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992) and has darker wings than the Laguna Mountains skipper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other species in the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur in San Diego County: the common checkered skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. communis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); the small checkered skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. scriptura
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); and the western checkered skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
P. albescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The Laguna Mountains skipper can be distinguished from all three of these species by the whitish appearance of the
adults and the use of a single larval host plant in the rose family (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Horkelia clevelandi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Garth and Tilden 1986, Scott 1986). In addition, the western checkered skipper and southern California populations
of the small checkered skipper are restricted to desert areas (Garth and Tilden 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Laguna Mountains skipper is currently found at one site in the Laguna Mountains and one site on Mount Palomar in
San Diego County, California (Dr. John Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). The total population of the Laguna Mountains skipper is estimated to be fewer than 100 individuals (Murphy
1990; Brown 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). The Laguna Mountains population is restricted to a relatively small fenced area where cattle cannot reach
the larval host plant (G. Pratt, as cited 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Murphy 1990; Dave Hogan, San Diego Biodiversity Project, pers. comm., 1993). The Laguna Mountains skipper was sighted
and collected on Mount Palomar in 1991 by D. Lindsley (J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992; Dr. John Brown, pers. comm., 1993). The Mount Palomar population is extremely small where only five specimens
have been reported in this century (J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Horkelia clevelandi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Cleveland's horkelia) is the larval host plant of the Laguna Mountains skipper. Cleveland's horkelia occurs along
the margins of pine meadows in the Laguna, Cuyamaca, Palomar, and San Jacinto Mountains of southwestern California
and northwestern Baja California, Mexico at 1200 to 2500 meters (m) (4000 to 8000 feet) in elevation. Although a butterfly's
distribution is generally defined by the presence of its larval host plant, it may be further restricted by other physiological
or ecological constraints. The Laguna Mountains skipper is currently found in a few open meadows of yellow pine forest
between 1500 to 2000 m (5000 and 6000 feet) in elevation; historically, this species was found at elevations between
1200 and 2500 m (4000 to 6000 feet). It may have occurred throughout the higher elevations of San Diego County (Murphy
1990; Brown 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992; and references cited therein). Murphy (1990) reported that there were at least six populations of this species
in the Laguna Mountains in the 1950's and 1960's (at Big Laguna, Little Laguna, East Laguna, Laguna Lake, Boiling Springs,
and Horse Heaven) (see also J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). Most specimens of the Laguna Mountains skipper were collected from Horse Heaven Springs near Mount Laguna
(Murphy 1990). Until rediscovery in 1983 by J. Emmel, the last known sightings of the skipper in the Laguna Mountains
were from 1972. Until specimens were collected in 1991, the last known sightings from Mount Palomar were from 1980
and, prior to that, from 1939 (Brown 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Laguna Mountains skipper is apparently bivoltine (two generations per year). The adult flight season occurs
from April to May with a complete or partial second brood flight in late June to late July. A partial second brood indicates
that this butterfly may have a flexible or variable diapause (state of suspended activity). The Laguna Mountains
skipper may have evolved a unique mechanism for coping with the low diurnal temperatures it encounters during its
spring flight, which is unusually early for butterflies in the Laguna Mountains (Brown 1991). It is assumed that the
life history of the Laguna Mountains skipper is similar to that of the nominate subspecies (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pyrgus ruralis ruralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which diapauses as a full grown larvae and adults live 10 to 20 days (J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Behr) is a small member of the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It is about 3 cm (1 inch) in length and
checkered with dark brown, reddish, and yellowish spots. It is one of 12 recognized subspecies of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (editha checkerspot) (Garth and Tilden 1986). The quino checkerspot can be distinguished from other subspecies
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by its wing coloration pattern and overall body size. The quino checkerspot tends to be larger with redder wings. The
light spots on the wings tend to be fewer and more disjunct than in the other subspecies (Garth and Tilden 1986). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is geographically disjunct from them. This taxon is also phenotypically similar to two other species of butterfly
that occur within its range. The Chalcedon checkerspot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. chalcedona
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is more yellow and is slightly larger than the quino checkerspot. Gabb's checkerspot (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chlosyne gabbii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is smaller than the quino checkerspot and has orange instead of red markings (Orsak 1977).

The quino checkerspot was first described in 1863 by Hans Herman Behr, an entomologist with the California Academy
of Sciences in San Francisco, as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Melitaea quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on a specimen from coastal San Diego County, California. It was subsequently recognized by Comstock (1927)
as a race of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Boisduval). For many years, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. e. quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was inappropriately recognized as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. e. wrightii.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This error was rectified by J. Emmel based on a study of Behr's notes and available specimens (D. Murphy, Center for
Conservation Biology, Stanford University, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1988; Allen 1990). The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is widely represented throughout North America, has been subdivided into closely related species groups (Scott
1986). The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is also referred to as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occidryas,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 but many authors retain the former name (e.g., Scott 1986; Harrison 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1988; Murphy 1990; Brown 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quino checkerspot is restricted to sunny openings on clay soils formed from gabbro parent materials within shrubland
habitats of the interior foothills of southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico (G. Ballmer,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Similar to the Laguna Mountains skipper and butterflies in general, its distribution is defined primarily
by that of its larval host plant but is further restricted by other factors. The primary larval food plant of the quino
checkerspot is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plantago erecta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (dwarf plantain, family Plantaginaceae). However, the larvae may also use 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plantago insularis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Orthocarpus purpurescens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (owl's clover, family Scrophulariaceae) (White 1974; Greg Ballmer, University of California at Riverside, pers.
comm., 1993). These plants grow in or near meadows, vernal pools, and lake margins in upland shrub communities including
sparse chaparral, and chaparral mixed with coastal sage scrub. This butterfly is generally found at sites where high
densities of the host plant occur (J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989; D. Hawks, University of California at Riverside, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992) and was found at a variety of elevations from about sea level to about 1200 m (4000 feet). Within these areas,
the quino checkerspot may be preferentially selecting sites where exposure to winter sun is greatest (Allen 1990).
These habitats, like the quino checkerspot butterfly, were once commonly found along coastal bluffs, mesas, and
inland foothills (Brown and Faulkner 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quino checkerspot may have been one of the most abundant butterflies in San Diego, Orange, and western Riverside
Counties during the early part of the 20th century (Murphy 1990). The original range of the quino checkerspot extended
as far south as Valle de la Trinidad in northwestern Baja California, Mexico, and as far north as Point Dume in Los Angeles
County (Allen 1990). Currently, only six to seven small populations are known within the United States. Five to six
populations occur near Vail Lake in southwestern Riverside and north-central San Diego Counties (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1990 and 1991; David Hawks, entomologist, University of California at Riverside, pers. comm., 1993). One other
population is known to occur (as of 1991) near Upper Otay Lake in San Diego County (Murphy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Although the latter population has likely been extirpated (Murphy, pers. comm., 1994). At least one population
exists in Mexico, in the Sierra Juarez near Tecate (Murphy, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Adult quino checkerspot butterflies were not seen at several historically occupied sites in Mexico during
a survey in the spring of 1993 (unpubl. Service data). No estimates of population size for the quino checkerspot are
currently available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adult quino checkerspot butterflies live from 4 to 8 weeks. The flight season occurs from mid-January to late April,
and peaks between March and April. The eggs hatch in about 10 days, and the larvae begin to feed immediately. Fourth
instar (development stage) larvae enter an obligatory diapause, as summer approaches and their larval food plant
senesces. Extended periods of diapause may occur during times of drought (G. Ballmer,

, 1990). Post-diapause larvae develop through four more instars and then pupate to emerge as adults in the early spring
(Murphy and White 1984).

On June 3, 1991, the Service received a petition dated May 27, 1991, from Mr. David Hogan of the San Diego Biodiversity
Project, to list four butterfly species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and Harbison's dun skipper (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphyes vestris harbisoni
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The petition cited loss and degradation of habitat, through various causes, as the major threat to these butterflies.
On July 12, 1993, the Service found that the petition contained substantial information indicating that the requested
action may be warranted for the Laguna Mountains skipper, but not for the other three butterflies listed above. The
latter finding was made because sufficient information was not available regarding the threats to and biological
vulnerability of these taxa. An announcement of these findings were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1993 (58 FR 38549). The Laguna Mountains skipper, Hermes copper, Thorne's hairstreak, and Harbison's
dun skipper are currently classified as category 2 candidates for Federal listing (November 21, 1991; 56 FR 58804).
Category 2 includes taxa for which information in the Service's possession indicates that listing is possibly appropriate
but for which the Service lacks substantial information upon which to base a proposal to list as endangered or threatened.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 30, 1988, the Service received a petition dated September 26, 1988, from Dr. Dennis Murphy of the Stanford
University Center for Conservation Biology, to list the quino checkerspot butterfly (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha quino
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered under the Act. At the time this petition was submitted, this taxon had not been seen for several years
and was thought to be extinct. Extant populations of the quino checkerspot were reported by Dr. Murphy in a letter dated
August 1, 1991, which again requested the Service to consider the petitioned action. The status of the quino checkerspot
has been under review by the Service since 1984 when it was classified as a category 2 candidate for Federal Listing
(May 22, 1984; 50 FR 37958). This taxon is currently classified as a category 1 candidate (November 21, 1991; 56 FR 58804),
meaning that information in the Service's possession is sufficient to support a proposal to list as endangered or
threatened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rule constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action to list the Laguna Mountains skipper as
warranted. In addition, this proposed rule constitutes the 90-day finding that the petition for the quino checkerspot
butterfly presented substantial information that the action may be warranted and the final 12-month finding for
this petition that the action is warranted.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement
the Act set forth criteria and procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be listed due to any
one or a combination of the five factors listed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act. These factors and their application to
the Laguna Mountains skipper (

A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The habitats and the ranges of the two species considered herein have been substantially reduced by urban and agricultural
development and recreational activities and are further threatened with destruction, modification, and curtailment.
The Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot currently occur within very restricted ranges and are extremely
localized in their present distributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The habitat requirements for these two butterflies are primarily defined by their larval host plants. The removal
or degradation of these plants, as well as that of nectar sources for adults, leads to the elimination of the affected
population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the Laguna Mountains skipper, habitat destruction and degradation from overgrazing and trampling
of its larval host plant by domestic cattle is considered to be the primary factor responsible for its decline (Murphy
1990; D. Hogan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991; J. Brown, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992). The larval host plant (Cleveland's horkelia) is itself a rare species and only found in the Laguna, Cuyamaca,
and San Jacinto Mountains of southwestern California, and northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The only known
extant skipper population in the Laguna Mountains is found in the El Prado campground area of the Cleveland National
Forest (Murphy 1990; D. Hogan, pers. comm., 1993). This area is protected from grazing cattle by a fence. Although
the larval host plant is found throughout the campground, it is subject to trampling by people (D. Hogan, pers. comm.,
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sunny openings within chaparral and coastal sage scrub occupied by the quino checkerspot butterfly have been degraded
by grazing and (to a small degree) destroyed by urban development. Fifty to seventy-five percent of the known range
of the quino checkerspot has been lost since 1900 due to habitat degradation or destruction (Brown 1991). The primary
larval food plant, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plantago erecta,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be displaced by exotic plants, which invade once the ground is disturbed by discing, grading, and/or grazing (J.
Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989; G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1990). The food plant then recolonizes in sites where grass does not grow well, like cattle trails and road edges,
where quino checkerspot larvae are subject to trampling (D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The encroachment of urban development in rural Riverside County potentially threatens one of the quino checkerspot
populations near Vail Lake. This area is growing rapidly and is projected to be fully developed within the decade (Monroe
et al. 1992). The Vail Lake area is included in a Community Plan that provides for subdivision of parcels into 20-acre
(9 hectare (ha)) lots (M. Freitas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1993). Additional development in this area is expected to further reduce and degrade habitat of the quino checkerspot
through construction of homes and roads, and increases in cattle and horse grazing, fire frequencies, and the distribution
and abundance of exotic plants. An existing recreational vehicle park and marina at Vail Lake attracts unauthorized
use of all terrain vehicles (ATV's) within natural habitat areas. ATV's increase the fire hazard and destroy habitat
through creation of trails. Evidence of ATV use is apparent at one of the quino checkerspot localities near Vail Lake,
where a recently created dirt road bisects the center of the habitat (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). Quino checkerspot habitat at this locality has been disced in part; these disturbed areas no longer support
this species, while the surrounding undisturbed areas do (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau of Land Management-administered lands and Forest Service Wilderness Areas are currently contiguous with
privately-owned quino checkerspot habitat near Vail Lake. As Riverside County becomes more densely populated,
fragmentation and degradation of this contiguous habitat is expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any residual individuals remaining near the last known population of the quino checkerspot in San Diego County would
be threatened by a proposed urban development project on Otay Mesa. The preferred alternative for the Otay Ranch New
Town Plan (the largest planned community in the southwestern United States) would result in the loss of 5,600 ha (14,000
acres) of upland shrub communities, or about 52 percent of their extent within the project area. The effects of this
project on the quino checkerspot are not known at this time but may be significant. Habitat loss due to grazing and clay
mining are the primary threats to the quino checkerspot butterfly in Mexico.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overcollection is a potential threat to both the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot because they
are rare butterflies. Johnson (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989) has noted that the number of quino checkerspot colonies has been reduced since lepidopterists, eager to include
rare species in their collections and to obtain surplus specimens for exchange or sale to other lepidopterists, have
visited the few remaining colonies steadily throughout the flight season. ``Where the populations may already be
small, this depredation by collectors may so weaken the colonies as to end their existence. I have witnessed examples
of this with other species of Lepidoptera whose loss of habitat has restricted the species to isolated colonies. These
have then been wiped out by intensive collection by lepidopterists.'' (J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1989). The remaining populations of the quino checkerspot butterfly near Vail Lake are threatened by overcollection.
In the spring of 1993, these populations were the subject of scientific collections for voucher specimens and captive-rearing
(D. Hawks, pers. comm., 1993). In addition, at least two collections of about six specimens each have been made by private
collectors for non-scientific purposes (unpubl. Service data).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A significant threat to the survival of both species considered herein is the potential for vandalism by landowners
who may view the presence of sensitive species as an obstacle to development. The habitat of the largest and most dense
quino checkerspot population in the Gavilan Hills of Riverside County was deliberately disced, in 1984 or 1985, to
eliminate this population (J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Disease or Predation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Disease is not known to be a factor affecting the species considered herein. There are no known predators of the Laguna
Mountains skipper. However, there is evidence that predation is a threat to the quino checkerspot. Studies conducted
by David Hawks (pers. comm., 1993) indicate that predation has contributed to the decline of the quino checkerspot
at sites where habitat has been invaded by non-native plant species, which may also harbor predatory arthropods.
Historical quino checkerspot habitat sites that have been heavily invaded by Mediterranean plant species also have
high sowbug (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Oniscus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sp.) and earwig (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Forficula 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
sp.) densities. Sowbugs and earwigs prey upon butterfly eggs. These predators, as well as the non-native plant species
that support them, are absent from natural sites currently occupied by the quino checkerspot butterfly (D. Hawks,
pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although specific parasites are unknown for the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, Johnson (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1989) speculates that parasitism can eliminate a butterfly colony. ``*&blank;*&blank;* butterfly or moth populations
will build up on the food plants for three or four years, then one will begin to find examples of larvae or pupae with parasites.
The parasitism increases for two or three seasons, when nearly all of the larvae or pupae are affected, the moth or butterfly
population disappears completely from the observed area, remains absent for some years, then the cycle is repeated''
(J. Johnson, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1989). This cycle can only continue if the affected area is recolonized, which is difficult when the host-butterfly
population is small, fragmented, and isolated. In general, however, outbreaks of disease or parasitism are more
likely to occur under conditions of high population densities. The Laguna Mountains skipper occurs in low population
densities; most populations of the Quino checkerspot also occur at low densities.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection for both the Laguna Mountains skipper and the
quino checkerspot include: (1) Listing under the California Endangered Species Act; (2) adequate consideration
under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); (3) local
laws and regulations; (4) occurrence with other species protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; and (5)
land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies, or by private groups and organizations for
the conservation of these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither of the species discussed herein is under consideration for listing under the California Endangered Species
Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of and threats to the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, as discussed under Factor A above,
reflect the failure of CEQA, NEPA, and local laws and regulations to protect and provide for the conservation of these
species. Although there are several regional conservation planning efforts underway within the range of the Laguna
Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot, none have been completed, approved, funded, or implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is not aware of any overlap in distribution between the Laguna Mountains skipper and any State or Federally
listed species. At some localities, the quino checkerspot co-occurs with the coastal California gnatcatcher (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Polioptila californica californica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a Federally listed threatened species. However, the habitat requirements for the quino checkerspot are different
than for the gnatcatcher. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some protection is afforded to the Laguna Mountains skipper on Forest Service land. However, this protection is limited
to a campground area that is subject to human disturbance. Considering the small population size and extremely limited
distribution of the Laguna Mountains skipper, this protection is insufficient to conserve the species. In the case
of the quino checkerspot, some protection may be provided to one population by its occurrence, in part, on Bureau of
Land Management land near Vail Lake in Riverside County. However, this Federal land is currently subject to off-road
vehicle activity (G. Ballmer, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is not aware of any regulatory mechanisms that protect the quino checkerspot in Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Man-Made Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The extremely restricted range and localized distribution, and small population size of the Laguna Mountains skipper
and the quino checkerspot makes them vulnerable to the effects of fragmentation, especially with regard to stochastic
events (e.g., see Gilpin and Soule 1986). For example, the Mount Palomar population of the Laguna Mountains skipper
is known from one site, where five specimens were taken. A chance event could easily extirpate this population of the
skipper. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although both butterflies occur in fire adapted ecosystems, a single fire event could eliminate affected populations.
Orsak (1977) reported that a quino checkerspot population near Hidden Ranch, Black Star Canyon, in the Santa Ana Mountains
of Orange County was apparently destroyed by a fire in 1967. (As discussed in the Background section above, the quino
checkerspot is now extirpated from Orange County.) The only site known to be occupied by the Laguna Mountains skipper
in the Laguna Mountains is subject to cattle grazing and trampling by both cattle and people.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interconnected populations can act as reservoirs to maintain populations that may be subject to periodic extirpation
(Murphy and White 1984, Harrison et. al 1988). If a stochastic event eliminates a population of either species (due
to factors discussed in this rule), few (if any) neighboring populations are available to recolonize the area. No
information is available regarding the vagility of the Laguna Mountains skipper. The sedentary behavior of the quino
checkerspot diminishes the probability that natural, long distance dispersal could reestablish most extirpated
local populations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Periodic droughts (like those recently occurring in southwestern California) can adversely affect both of the species
considered herein. Drought is known to decrease numbers of butterflies (Thorne 1963). Drought conditions may cause
loss or early senescence of the larval host plant prior to completion of larval development, or lower the nutritional
quality of the host plant (e.g., water content). Drought can also reduce the quantity and quality of adult nectar sources.
Larval starvation and extirpation of local populations during periods of drought have been documented for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euphydryas editha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (White 1974, Ehrlich et al. 1980). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat fragmentation can affect the genetic heterogeneity of small isolated populations like those of the Laguna
Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot. Small, fragmented populations are subject to a higher frequency of
genetic drift and inbreeding. As a consequence, genetic variation of the population and individual heterozygosity
is decreased. That can lead to inbreeding depression and lowered fitness of individuals. Low genetic diversity may
decrease the ability of a species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Genetically homogenous populations
may be at a greater risk of extinction from environmental or demographic stochasticity (e.g., from fire or drought
events) than are large, diverse populations that can more readily recover from such events. For example, variation
in the length of diapause among butterfly offspring requires genetic heterogeneity (see Seger and Brockman 1987).
If a population is variable in diapause length, it has a lower risk of losing an entire cohort to adverse environmental
conditions during any given season. Individuals with prolonged diapause may survive if drought causes high mortality
during the next season. A large population or metapopulation can maintain the genetic heterogeneity needed to maintain
the population during these kinds of events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The quino checkerspot is somewhat adapted to unpredictable weather patterns but requires sufficient patches of
suitable habitat to respond to this environmental stochasticity. The quino checkerspot's dispersal capabilities
vary considerably depending upon rainfall patterns and the resulting availability of adult nectar sources and larval
food plants. For example, a San Diego County population of the quino checkerspot exhibited an increase in numbers
as a result of favorable weather (Murphy and White 1984). The greater number of larvae defoliated the larval food plants.
This central core area was left without sufficient egg-laying sites for females, and adults went for greater dispersal
distances in search of additional suitable habitat. Ideally these dispersing adults would have found marginally
suitable areas, and in subsequent generations would have returned to a central core area. In this case, the mass dispersal
failed to restore populations in previously occupied habitat, and the butterflies have not re-colonized the original
site (Murphy and White 1984; Murphy, pers. comm. 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these two taxa in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,
the Service finds that the preferred action is to list the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot as endangered.
The range and habitat of these species has been substantially reduced by historical activities associated with urban
and agricultural development and recreational activities. These two taxa are threatened by one or more of the following
factors: Habitat alteration and destruction resulting from urban and agricultural development, grazing, overcollection,
recreational activities, inadequate regulatory mechanisms, and displacement of the larval host plant by exotic
species. The extremely restricted range, localized distribution, and small population size of both butterflies
makes them very vulnerable to extinction by the factors listed above as well as by stochastic events such as fire and
drought. For these reasons, the Service finds that the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot are in imminent
danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges. Threatened status would not accurately
reflect the diminished status and threats to these species. Other alternatives to this action were considered but
not preferred because not listing these species would not provide adequate protection and would be inconsistent
with the purposes of the Act. Critical habitat is not being proposed for these taxa for the reasons discussed below.

Critical habitat, as defined by section 3(5)(A) of the Act, means: (i) The specific areas within the geographical
area occupied by a species, at the time it is listed in accordance with the Act, on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) that may require special management considerations
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by a species at the time it is listed,
upon a determination that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that critical habitat be designated to the maximum extent prudent and determinable
concurrently with the determination that a species is endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations (50 CFR
424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations
exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other human activity, and identification of critical habitat can
be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would
not be beneficial to the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent at this time for the Laguna Mountains skipper
and the quino checkerspot. The quino checkerspot, mostly occurs on privately owned lands with little or no Federal
involvement, although the Bureau of Land Management owns a portion of one site. The additional protection provided
by the designation of critical habitat to a species is only achieved through section 7. Therefore, the designation
of critical habitat would not appreciably benefit the quino checkerspot. Publication of precise maps and descriptions
of critical habitat for the quino checkerspot and the Laguna Mountains skipper could result in additional habitat
destruction through trampling, discing, and grading as well as collection. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary
of Factors Affecting the Species'' section of this proposal, habitat for the one of the largest quino checkerspot
colonies was graded in Riverside County to deliberately eliminate that population, and a number of quino checkerspot
colonies have been subject to collection by lepidopterists for trading and similar purposes.

Available Conservation Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal agencies expected to have involvement with the Laguna Mountains skipper and the quino checkerspot include
the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management due to the presence of habitat and populations within their jurisdiction.
The Immigration and Naturalization Service may need to evaluate the effects of its activities on the quino checkerspot,
which is known to occur near the international border in San Diego County.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or
to attempt any of these), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It is also illegal to possess,
sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing such permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. In some instances involving trade, permits may be issued for a specified time to
relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. The Laguna Mountains skipper
and quino checkerspot are not involved in trade, and such permit requests are not expected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations on listed wildlife and plants and inquiries regarding them should be addressed
to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services_Endangered Species Permits, 911 Northeast 11th Ave,
Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (telephone 503/231&hyph;6241).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the San Diego fairy shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta sandiegoensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) as endangered throughout its range in southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, pursuant
to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This species occurs in vernal pools and is threatened by a variety
of factors including: Habitat destruction and fragmentation from agricultural and urban development, alterations
of wetland hydrology by draining, off-road vehicle activity, and cattle and sheep grazing. This proposed rule, if
made final, would extend the Act's protection to the San Diego fairy shrimp.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta sandiegoensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is a member of Branchinectidae, a freshwater crustacean family in the Order Anostraca (fairy shrimp). The species
was first described by Michael Fugate (1993) based on collections made at Del Mar Mesa in San Diego County in 1990 by
himself and M. Simovich. The San Diego fairy shrimp is closely allied with, and has historically been misidentified
as, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a species widely distributed in western North America. The San Diego fairy shrimp was first collected (but then identified
as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Poway and Ramona, San Diego County, in 1962; additional collections were made on Kearny Mesa in 1979 (Simovich
and Fugate 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp is restricted to vernal pools, which occur in areas with shallow depressions that have a
clay hardpan soil layer that inhibits water percolation. This results in a perched water table during the winter rainy
season and the following spring. Vernal pools retain water only long enough to support relatively few species of aquatic
emergent plants and invertebrates. As the pools dry and the surface water recedes toward the center of the pool, a unique
and dynamic flora develops in its place. Vernal pools typically occur on mesa tops or valley floors and are surrounded
by very low hills, usually referred to as mima mounds (Zedler 1987). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp is a small and delicate animal with large stalked compound eyes, no carapace, and 11 pairs
of swimming legs. Mature males are from 9 to 16 mm (0.4 to 0.6 in) in length and females are 8 to 14 mm (0.4 to 0.5 in) in length.
They swim or glide upside down by means of complex beating movements of the legs that pass in a wave-like anterior to
posterior direction. The second pair of antennae on the adult female are cylindrical and elongate, but in the male
are greatly enlarged and specialized for clasping the female during copulation. The female carries the eggs in an
oval or elongate ventral brood sac. The eggs are either released or remain attached to the female until she dies and
sinks. The thick-shelled eggs are capable of withstanding high heat, cold, and prolonged desiccation.

The San Diego fairy shrimp occurs in San Diego County from San Marcos and Ramona south to Otay Mesa and at Valle de Palmas
in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. All known localities are below 700 meters (2,300 feet) and within 50 kilometers
(30 miles) of the Pacific coast. Five other branchinectid fairy shrimp occur in southern California. Only one of these
species, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is known from San Diego County (Simovich and Fugate 1992). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a habitat generalist and may occur in ponds or ditches. The only other branchinectid fairy shrimp in southern California
that is similar in appearance to the San Diego fairy shrimp is the vernal pool fairy shrimp (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lynchi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), which occurs in adjacent Riverside County. Male San Diego fairy shrimp may be separated from males of other species
within the genus by the shape of the second antenna. Female San Diego fairy shrimp are distinguishable by the shape
and length of the ovisac and egg and by the presence of paired dorsolateral spines (Fugate 1993). The San Diego fairy
shrimp is a habitat specialist and is restricted to vernal pools. This species occasionally occurs in ditches and
road ruts, but only if these depressions are in degraded vernal pool habitat (D. Hogan, San Diego Biodiversity Project,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1992; Marie Simovich, University of San Diego, pers. comm., 1993). This species appears to prefer cool water temperatures
ranging from 10 to 23 degrees centigrade (Fugate and Simovich 1992). The prehistorical distribution of this species
is uncertain. The majority of the vernal pools in this region were lost prior to 1990. However, based on historical
collections (some originally identified as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) the San Diego fairy shrimp was known from at least 15 locales within San Diego County (Balko and Ebert 1987, Fugate
1993). The fairy shrimp presently occurs in fewer than 70 vernal pools within 11 vernal pool complexes in coastal San
Diego County (Hogan 1992). Three of the San Diego County populations of this species are on Federal land (all on Miramar
Naval Air Station). Two others are, in part, on public land (Del Mar Mesa Vernal Pool Preserve and Mission Trails Regional
Park). The San Diego fairy shrimp has also been reported from Isla Vista in Santa Barbara County, California, but the
identification of the single female individual is unconfirmed (Michael Fugate, University of Oregon, pers. comm.,
1993). Directed surveys of vernal pools in Isla Vista for fairy shrimp have not located any additional San Diego fairy
shrimp individuals (Marie Simovich, pers. comm., 1994). The vernal pools in south coastal Santa Barbara County have
been significantly reduced in number by the same factors that have reduced the number of vernal pools in San Diego County
(Ferren and Pritchett 1988). The Santa Barbara County vernal pools are now isolated from those in San Diego County
by agricultural and urban development in Ventura, Los Angeles, and Orange Counties.

Previous Federal Action 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 24, 1992, the Service received a petition to list the San Diego fairy shrimp as endangered. Petitioners were
Dave Hogan of the San Diego Biodiversity Project in Julian, California, and Denton Belk of Our Lady of the Lake University
in San Antonio, Texas. The Service finds that substantial information was presented in the petition to indicate that
the requested action may be warranted. This finding is based on a detailed narrative justification in the petition
for the recommended action, including information about the distribution, decline, and threats to this species
over a significant portion of its range. This proposed rule is the first Federal action on the San Diego fairy shrimp
and constitutes the final 1-year finding on the petitioned action that the action is warranted, as required by section
4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the San Diego fairy
shrimp (

 Fugate) are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range The natural plant
communities of coastal San Diego County and northwestern Baja California, Mexico, have undergone significant changes
as a result of both direct and indirect human-caused activities. The rapid urbanization of this region has already
eliminated a significant proportion of the vernal pool habitat for this taxon. The remaining patches of habitat are
frequently isolated, degraded, and/or fragmented by agricultural practices, streambed channelization and other
hydrological alterations, and grazing. Vernal pools have undergone an extraordinary reduction in number and have
nearly been eliminated in southern California. In San Diego County, over 97 percent of vernal pool habitat had been
lost by 1986 (Bauder 1986). While it is uncertain how many of these pools were occupied by the San Diego fairy shrimp,
the species was known to occupy a number of vernal pools that have since been disturbed, destroyed or lost (Bauder 1986,
Balko and Ebert 1987, Fugate 1993). In San Diego County, the San Diego fairy shrimp occurs within vernal pool complexes
that have been and continue to be impacted by urbanization and agricultural conversion (Bauder 1986, Hogan and Belk
1992, Nancy Gilbert and Ellen Berryman, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). Nine of the 11 known populations
of San Diego fairy shrimp in San Diego County are declining because of vernal pool destruction (Bauder 1986; D. Hogan,
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992; Marie Simovich, pers. comm., 1993). At least two populations of the San Diego fairy shrimp occur on Otay Mesa
in San Diego County. A minimum of 37 proposed Precise Plans and Tentative Maps for development have been filed pursuant
to the California Environmental Quality Act for this area. These plans encompass about 80 percent of the undeveloped
portion of the mesa within the jurisdiction of the city of San Diego and virtually all but four of the remaining vernal
pool complexes. Several of these projects will impact the San Diego fairy shrimp. At least one major transportation
project has been proposed for Otay Mesa and could potentially impact vernal pools that are occupied by the San Diego
fairy shrimp. The San Diego fairy shrimp is found on Federal lands managed by the Navy. The species occurs on Miramar
Naval Air Station. These lands are used, in part, for military training activities that involve off-road vehicle
maneuvers that adversely impact the species (Hogan and Belk 1992).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trash dumping has also degraded vernal pools in San Diego County. Discarded chunks of concrete, tires, refrigerators,
furniture, and other pieces of garbage or debris have been found in pools containing the San Diego fairy shrimp. This
trash crushes or shades vernal pool plants, disrupts the hydrologic functions of the pool, and in some cases, may release
toxic substances. Vernal pools in San Diego County have also been degraded by off-road vehicles. These vehicles compact
soils, crush plants when water is present, cause turbidity, and leave deep ruts. This type of damage may alter the microhydrology
of the pools. Dirt roads that go through or adjacent to pools are widened as motorists try to avoid mud puddles and in
this way, the pools are gradually destroyed. The San Diego fairy shrimp's vernal pool habitat is also vulnerable to
indirect destruction due to the alteration of the supporting watershed. An increase in water due to urban run-off
leads to increased inundation and makes pools vulnerable to invasion by marshy plant species resulting in decreased
abundance of obligate vernal pool taxa. At the other extreme, some pools have been drained or blocked from their source
of water and have shown an increased domination by upland plant species. The San Diego fairy shrimp is especially vulnerable
to alterations in hydrology. Development projects adjacent to vernal pools are often responsible for adverse alterations
in drainage. Hydrological alterations are sometimes a result of agricultural development, or a combination of urban
development and agriculture. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or Educational Purposes Overutilization is not
currently a known threat factor for the San Diego fairy shrimp. C. Disease or Predation As vernal pools mature, there
is a gradual increase in numbers and size of predaceous aquatic insects, known to consume fairy shrimp (Zedler 1987).
D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms Existing regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection
for the San Diego fairy shrimp include: (1) Consideration under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA);
(2) implementation of conservation plans pursuant to the State of California's Natural Community Conservation
Planning Act of 1991 (NCCP), the San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP), and the San Diego County Multiple
Habitat Conservation Plan (MHCP); (3) section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act; (4) occurrence with other species
protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; (5) land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local
agencies, or by private groups and organizations; (6) local laws and regulations; and (7) Mexican law. Most of the
known populations of the taxon occur on privately owned land. Local lead agencies empowered to uphold and enforce
the regulations of the CEQA have made determinations that have or will adversely affect the San Diego fairy shrimp.
Required biological surveys are often inadequate and project proponents may ignore the results of surveys if occurrences
of sensitive species are viewed as a constraint on project design. Mitigation measures used to condition project
approvals are essentially experimental and fail to adequately guarantee protection of sustainable populations.
For example, in San Diego County, vernal pools containing the San Diego fairy shrimp and the Federal- and State-listed
Pogogyne abramsii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (San Diego mesa mint) were destroyed without adequate environmental documentation or coordination with the Service
and the California Department of Fish and Game. In this case, the project proponent was a school district. Section
15380 of CEQA requires that impacts to any taxon that meets the criteria for listing under the California Endangered
Species Act be treated as significant regardless of its current listing status. The San Diego fairy shrimp has been
recognized as a distinct taxon by the scientific and local conservation communities since 1990. Impacts to this species
would qualify as significant under section 15380 of CEQA even though this species was not formally recognized until
1993 (Fugate 1993). However, this taxon has only been considered in a limited number of environmental impact reports
since 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991, the State of California established the NCCP program to address the conservation needs of natural ecosystems
throughout the State. The initial focus of this program was the coastal sage scrub community. The San Diego fairy shrimp
is found in vernal pools and not coastal sage scrub. The San Diego fairy shrimp is being considered under the MSCP and
MHCP programs. These programs, under development by the County of San Diego and its coastal cities, are being integrated
as components of the NCCP program. However, these programs are still in the developmental phase, and it is uncertain
as to what degree they will be successful in providing protection for this species. For example, two alternatives
of the MSCP (coastal sage scrub and public lands) would not provide adequate preservation for the San Diego fairy shrimp
because much of the shrimp's habitat (vernal pools) would be excluded.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates the discharge of fill into
waters of the United States, including navigable waters, wetlands (e.g., vernal pools), and other waters. The Clean
Water Act requires project proponents to obtain a permit from the Corps prior to undertaking many activities (e.g.,
grading, discharge of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in the fill of wetlands under the Corps'
jurisdiction. The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit Number 26 (see 33 CFR 330.5(a)(26)) to address fill of isolated
or headwater wetlands totalling less than 10 acres. Under Nationwide Permit 26, proposals that involve the fill of
wetlands less than one acre are considered authorized. Where fill would adversely modify between 1 to 10 acres of wetland,
the Corps circulates a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties for comment to determine
whether or not an individual permit should be required for a proposed fill activity and associated impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual permits are required for the discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than
10 acres of wetlands. The review process for the issuance of individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide
permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit
applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require the avoidance or mitigation of environmental
impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an applicant to seek an individual
permit if the Corps believes that the resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In
practice, the Corps rarely requires an individual permit when a project would qualify for a nationwide permit, unless
when a threatened or endangered species or other significant resources would be adversely affected by the proposed
activity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp could potentially be affected by projects requiring a permit from the Corps under section
404 of the Clean Water Act. Although the objective of the Clean Water Act is to ``restore and maintain the chemical,
physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters'' (Pub. L. 92&hyph;500), which include navigable and
isolated waters, headwaters, and adjacent wetlands, no specific provisions adequately address the need to conserve
candidate species such as the San Diego fairy shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the Corps establishes jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over vernal pools, this does not ensure their
protection. At least two vernal pool complexes under Corps jurisdiction in San Diego County have been destroyed or
degraded without a section 404 permit (Jim Dice, Calif. Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993; U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service data files).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act can incidentally afford protection to the San Diego fairy shrimp if they co-exist with species already listed
as threatened or endangered.

) are listed as endangered under the Act and occur in the same habitat as the San Diego fairy shrimp. However, these species
are generally not found in the same vernal pool complexes as the San Diego fairy shrimp. The Riverside fairy shrimp
and San Diego fairy shrimp co-exist in only three vernal pool complexes in San Diego County. Within a vernal pool complex,
the San Diego fairy shrimp does not often occur in the same pools as listed species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Land acquisition and management by Federal, State, or local agencies, or by private groups and organizations has
contributed to the protection of some localities inhabited by this taxon. However, as discussed below, these efforts
are often directed at other species and are inadequate to assure the long-term survival of the San Diego fairy shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp occurs within the California Department of Transportation Vernal Pool Preserve. Although
these pools are managed for the long-term protection of vernal pool flora and fauna, off-road vehicle activity, development
proposals immediately adjacent to the preserve, and proposed restoration actions threaten the San Diego fairy shrimp
at this locality (Hogan and Belk 1992; M. Simovich, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp also occurs in northwestern Baja California, Mexico. The Service is not aware of any existing
regulatory mechanisms in Mexico that would protect the San Diego fairy shrimp or its habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cattle grazing occurs on Otay Mesa in areas where several vernal pool complexes contain the San Diego fairy shrimp.
Livestock grazing typically changes the composition of native plant communities by reducing or eliminating those
species that can not withstand trampling and by enabling more resistant (usually non-native) species to increase
in abundance. Taxa that were not previously part of the native flora may be introduced and flourish under a grazing
regime and may reduce or replace native species through competition for resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disturbance of vernal pools in San Diego County increases the potential for other fairy shrimp species (such as the
widespread 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Branchinecta lindahli
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) to replace the San Diego fairy shrimp, which is unable to persist under disturbed conditions (M. Simovich, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., University of San Diego, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Diego fairy shrimp are highly reliant on seasonal rainfall. Drier conditions, such as those that prevailed from
1986 to 1992, reduce the number of individuals in populations. Climatic conditions stress species. Negative effects
of habitat loss and degradation from other factors including development, discing, and grazing, when combined with
climatic conditions, increase the level of threat to the San Diego fairy shrimp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by the San Diego fairy shrimp in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,
the Service finds that the preferred action is to list the San Diego fairy shrimp as endangered. The San Diego fairy
shrimp is threatened by one or more of the following factors: Habitat alteration and destruction resulting from urban
and agricultural development; alteration of hydrology; off-road vehicle use/recreational activities; inadequate
regulatory mechanisms; and grazing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The San Diego fairy shrimp is in imminent danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
Critical habitat is not being proposed for this taxon for the reasons discussed below.

Critical Habitat
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
designate critical habitat at the time the taxon is listed. Critical habitat is not determinable if insufficient
information exists to perform an economic impact analysis of designating a particular area as critical habitat,
or if the biological needs of the species are not sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as critical
habitat (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is in the process of defining critical habitat and determining more clearly what the ecological requirements
and constituent elements are for the San Diego fairy shrimp. The Service may find that determination of critical habitat
is not prudent for this taxon, however, at this time designation of critical habitat is not determinable.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants and animals are discussed, in
part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If
a species is subsequently listed, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or destroy or adversely modify
its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal
agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.

Federal agencies expected to have involvement with the San Diego fairy shrimp include the Army Corps of Engineers
and the Environmental Protection Agency due to their permit authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The
San Diego fairy shrimp occurs on the U.S. Navy's Miramar Air Station. This base will likely be involved through military
activities or potential excessing of Federal lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that
apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or
to attempt any of these), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial
activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species of wildlife. It is also illegal
to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions
apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing such permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. In some instances involving trade, permits may be issued for a specified time to
relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. The San Diego fairy shrimp
is not involved in trade, and such permit requests are not expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the requirements and regulations on permits or trade in wildlife and plants and inquiries regarding
them should be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Parish's meadowfoam) as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened throughout their respective ranges in southwestern California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species occur in vernally moist soils of montane wet meadows, near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
springs and seeps, or vernal pools within the Peninsular Ranges of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southwestern California. These plants are imperiled by a variety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors including alteration of wetland hydrology, cattle grazing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational activities, recreational development, off-road vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity, and competition from exotic plant species. This proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, if made final, would extend protection under the Act to these two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. Critical habitat is not being proposed at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional data and information, which may assist the Service in making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a final decision on this proposed action, is solicited on the status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these species.

 (Parish's meadowfoam) occur in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association with meadows and drainages of the Peninsular Ranges of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southwestern California from the Santa Ana Mountains of extreme 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
southwestern Riverside County, south to the Laguna Mountains of southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Diego County, California. Both plant taxa are restricted to grassy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meadows that are vernally wet (wet during the rainy season) with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturated soil conditions and shallow pools for several weeks at a time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Between the ponded areas are drier mounds, called mima mounds. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of physiography is referred to as a montane meadow-vernal pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The largest populations of both taxa are located within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cuyamaca Valley in the Cuyamaca Mountains of central San Diego County, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. Although the vernal pool and mima mound topography is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mostly obliterated, much of the unique, montane, vernal pool flora 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains. This flora includes a number of disjunct species that are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently associated with vernal pools of coastal San Diego County or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central California (e.g.,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, a depression at the southwestern end of the Cuyamaca 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Valley formed a small lake that dried up in the summer. This area was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as ``Laguna Que Se Seca'' (the lake that dries up) (Allen and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Curto 1987). This area and the rest of the valley supported a complex 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of vernal pools and mima mounds. A dam was built in 1886 at the Boulder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Creek outlet of Cuyamaca Lake. The dam created a permanent reservoir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as Cuyamaca Lake. A dike built in 1967 allowed water to be pumped 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the reservoir so that the valley could be kept in a flooded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition throughout the summer (Ball et al., unpub. man.). In wet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years, the reservoir and dike system allows the entire valley to remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooded for extended periods (Bauder 1992). Many areas supporting these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxa have been moderately to heavily grazed in the past and some areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continue to be adversely affected by livestock and horses. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy grazing in the Laguna Mountains since the 1880's has resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increased abundance of introduced annual grasses and forbs, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scarcity of organic matter, and severe gullying and erosion (Sproul 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979).

 was located throughout much of the valley floor. This population has now been largely restricted to the shore of the
lake, penetrating into the valley floor during dry years. From 1988 to 1992 one population existed in the vicinity
of Cuyamaca Lake, consisting of between 9 and 24 stands. Combined, these stands occupied less than 200 acres and frequently
occupied less than 100 acres. The number of individuals within these stands, and the location and size of these stands
vary in any given year in response to rainfall, the extent of winter flooding, and temperature (Bauder 1992).

 is a member of the meadowfoam family (Limnanthaceae), a small family of wetland species found primarily along the
Pacific coast of North America. The plant is a low, widely branching annual with stems 10 to 20 cm (4 to 8 in) long. The
leaves are 2 to 6 cm (0.5 to 2 in) long and divided. The flowers are bowl-shaped, the petals are 8 to 10 mm (0.25 to 0.5 in)
long with a white or occasionally with a cream-colored base that becomes pink (Ornduff 1993). The fruit is rough textured.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act amendments of 1978 required all proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 2 years old to be withdrawn, although a 1-year grace period was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given to those proposals. In the December 10, 1979,

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(44 FR 70796), the Service published a notice of withdrawal for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of the June 6, 1976, proposal that had not been made final and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (48 FR 53640). This notice was again revised on September 27, 1985 (50 FR 39526). Both plant taxa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were included in 1983 and 1985 supplements to the Notice of Review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plants as category 2 candidate taxa (species for which data in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service's possession indicate listing may be appropriate, but for which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional biological information is needed to support a proposed rule). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of Review of Plants was again revised on February 21, 1990

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make findings on pending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1982 amendments further requires that all petitions pending on October 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13, 1982 be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was the case for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983, the Service found that the petitioned listing of this species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted but precluded by other pending listing proposals of higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
priority, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this finding was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 20, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984 (49 FR 2485). Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in October of 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 64828&hyph;45). One reason was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited as the basis for this finding on this species that was based upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data not then available to the Service in late summer 1993: current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats (i.e., the five factors described below under 50 CFR 424.11) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout a significant portion of the species' range. The species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained in Category 2 on the basis that it may be subject to extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or endangerment from uncontrolled loss of habitat or from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
man-caused changes to its environment (58 FR 64840). Since the summer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1993, the Service has completed or obtained survey and other data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adequately describe those factors that are placing

at risk of extinction. The Service has proceeded to propose

this species along with the Lake Cuyamaca downingia that occupies the

. The habitat for both these taxa is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened by recreational developments, off-road vehicle use, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trampling, alterations of hydrology and the introduction of exotic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, montane wet meadow and vernal pool habitats were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
much more abundant in the Peninsular Ranges of San Diego County (Winter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991). The wet meadows surrounding Cuyamaca Lake reservoir support the

most significant populations of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The entire Cuyamaca Valley was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally a montane meadow-vernal pool complex. Dredging during dam 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction in 1886 altered the natural topography of the valley and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its vernal pools. Mima mounds were likely excavated since ``much of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earth used for the dam was taken from the meadow north of the dam and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the valley floor'' (Allen and Curto 1987). Later, 160 ha (400 ac) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the valley outside the reservoir was leased from Helix Water District 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and planted in grain. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loss of wet meadow habitat continues as a result of excessive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water inundation at Cuyamaca Lake reservoir and within Cuyamaca Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above the dike. Studies of

, conducted between 1988 and 1992, have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated that extended inundation at Cuyamaca Lake caused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extirpation of stands for these two species (Bauder 1992). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reservoir provides domestic water, flood control, and recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities such as fishing and duck hunting. These uses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered through agreements between the Helix Water District, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City of San Diego's El Capitan Reservoir, and Lake Cuyamaca Recreation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Park District (Bauder 1992). Approximately 81 ha (150 ac) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential meadow habitat are permanently inundated. The system of dikes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built in 1967 allows an additional 273 ha (675 ac) to be inundated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended periods of time during periods of high precipitation; that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred as recently as 1993 (Hugh Marks, Cuyamaca Lake Recreation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

inundation (Bauder 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variety of indirect impacts are associated with the diversion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water entering the Cuyamaca Lake reservoir basin. Diversion often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results in the alteration of small drainages by down cutting and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streambank erosion, which contributes to the loss of potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable habitat upstream of Cuyamaca Lake. Fluctuating lake levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also increase channel erosion by changing the gradient and velocity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding drainages. Erosion is further intensified by the decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in groundwater levels caused by numerous wells in the area. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
streamflow velocities are high, Downingia 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limnanthes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
seeds and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants can be buried or washed away. In dry years, meadows exposed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the receding shoreline dry prematurely as the groundwater level falls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roads without adequate culverts also divert water flow. Road 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance and herbicidal weed abatement often preclude the re-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of seeds in areas of suitable habitat (Bauder 1992). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the alteration of hydrology in Cuyamaca Valley promotes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invasion of exotic species (e.g., Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pratensis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Kentucky bluegrass)) known to displace native plant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These indirect effects can have significant, long-term impacts on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meadow habitats and associated sensitive plant species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct loss of both species' habitat at the reservoir is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial. For example, a parking lot and a campground on the south 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of Cuyamaca Lake reservoir at Los Caballos have displaced habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Bauder 1992). The Prado campground on the Cleveland National Forest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also displaced

Disease is not known to be a factor

trampling, erosion (see Factor A) and the introduction of non-native

species (see Factor E). Grazing was discontinued on Helix Water

terminated in Cuyamaca State Park in 1956, with the exception of a 16 ha 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 ac) parcel that was grazed until 1980 when it was acquired by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Park. Grazing still continues on privately owned pastures east of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reservoir. The Cleveland National Forest still allows grazing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sensitive meadows but recently adopted late season grazing regimes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to avoid loss of individual plants due to actual consumption (Volgarino,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Existing

regulatory mechanisms that could provide some protection for these

Act (CESA); (2) the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); (3) conservation provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and section 1603 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the California Fish and Game Code, (4) occurrence with other species

protected by the Federal Endangered Species Act; (5) land acquisition

.). After the California Department of Fish and Game 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant occurs on his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property, the Fish and Game Code requires only that the landowner notify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 10, section 1913, California Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Game Code). Therefore, although NPPA and CESA both prohibit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``take'' of State-listed plants (Chapter 10, sections 1908 and Chapter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.5, section 2080, California Fish and Game Code), these statutes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not adequate to protect the taking of such plants via habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification or land use change by the landowner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Public Resources Code, section 21000 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires full disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary
authority or jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency and is responsible for conducting a review
of the project and for consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. CEQA
documentation is often inadequate or incomplete, and compliance with CEQA is not monitored. Section 15065 of the
CEQA Guidelines requires a finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the number or restrict
the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' However, even if significant effects are identified, the lead
agency has the option to require mitigation through changes in the project or to decide that ``overriding social and
economic considerations'' make mitigation infeasible (California Public Resources Code, Guidelines, section
15093). In the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant environmental damage, such as destruction
of endangered plant species. Protection of listed plant species under CEQA is therefore dependent upon the discretion
of the lead agency, hence, this is not adequate to ensure the survival of a species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District is the lead agency that is empowered to uphold and enforce CEQA regulations
at Cuyamaca Lake reservoir. However, unresolved conflicts exist regarding the use of this area for recreation and
habitat protection for state endangered species. The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District receives funding from
CDFG, State Bonds, California Division of Parks and Recreation, U.S. National Park Service Land and Water Grants,
and other sources, which have been used to stock the reservoir with fish, build duck blinds, a boat ramp, picnic facilities
and a fishing trail around the western portion of the reservoir between the dam and the dike. Projects that use state
money must comply with CEQA on each project or funding can be withdrawn. Impacts to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 occur during implementation of these projects and may continue to occur as a result of maintenance and use of these
facilities. The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District, acting as the state lead agency, has issued negative declarations
for its improvement and maintenance activities, which exempts them from the requirement for a full environmental
analysis. Other signatory state agencies have not monitored CEQA compliance by the Cuyamaca Recreation and Park
District (Jack Shu, California State Parks Department, pers. comm., 1993). These factors have resulted in removal
of plants and habitat loss as discussed in factor A above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While CEQA pertains to projects on non-Federal land, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321
to 4347) requires disclosure of the environmental effects of projects within Federal jurisdiction. Species that
are listed by the State, but not proposed or listed as threatened or endangered by the Federal government, are not protected
when a proposed Federal action meets the criterion for a ``categorical exclusion''. NEPA requires that each of the
project alternatives recommend ways to ``protect, restore and enhance the environment'' and ``avoid and minimize
any possible adverse effects'' when implementation poses significant adverse impacts. However, it does not require
that the lead agency select an alternative with the least significant impacts to the environment (40 CFR 1500 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Federal actions that may affect Federal threatened or endangered species require consultation with the Fish and
Wildlife Service under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act and must avoid jeopardizing the continued existence
of a listed plant species and destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District is also subject to NEPA because projects for recreational improvements
may be funded through the Federal Land and Water Grant program that is administered by the National Park Service through
the California Department of Parks and Recreation. These projects would require NEPA review. Land-use planning
decisions at the local level are made on the basis of environmental review documents prepared in accordance with CEQA
or NEPA that often do not adequately address ``cumulative'' impacts to non-listed species and their habitat. State
listed species that are candidates for Federal listing receive no special consideration under NEPA.

Section 1603 of the California Fish and Game Code authorizes the Department of Fish and Game to regulate streambed
alteration. The Department must be notified and approve any work that diverts, alters, or obstructs the natural flow
or changes the bed, channel, or banks of any river, stream, or lake. If the Department does not respond within 30 days
of the notification, the applicant may proceed with the work. All waterways of the State, including streams, intermittent
streams, rivers, and lakes are subject to the Department's jurisdiction. However, the Department of Fish and Game
does not consider the creation of wetlands for duck habitat to be regulated under section 1603. Thus, a Streambed Alteration
Agreement was not required for flooding the streambed above Cuyamaca Lake reservoir for that purpose. Because the
dam has been used continuously since its construction in 1886, justification of its continued use for recreation
has been grandfathered into law (William D. Smith, Lake Cuyamaca Recreation and Park District,

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act authorizes the Army Corps of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineers (Corps) to regulate discharge of dredge or fill materials into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters of the United States, including wetlands. The objective of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Clean Water Act is to ``restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological integrity of the Nation's waters'' (Pub. L. 92&hyph;500), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include navigable and isolated waters, headwaters, and adjacent

wetlands. However, no specific provisions exist that adequately address

special consideration under section 404. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though some of the areas surrounding Cuyamaca Lake reservoir 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are wetlands, water management activities are not regulated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and these activities have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to adversely affect the two taxa under consideration in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. Several small water impoundments in streams around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cuyamaca Lake reservoir may qualify for authorization under Nationwide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit (NWP) No. 26 of the Clean Water Act if they are less than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acre (0.4 ha) in size. Because projects affecting such streams or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wetlands may proceed without notifying the Corps, evaluation of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts under section 404 is precluded. An individual permit may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by the Corps if projects otherwise qualifying under NWP 26 are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to have significant environmental impacts. However, the Corps is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally reluctant to withhold authorization under NWP 26 unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existence of a Federally listed species is likely to be jeopardized or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the action impacts a vernal pool (Bruce Henderson, Army Corps of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineers, pers. comm., 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates clearing of

vegetation by mechanical means (e.g., bulldozing) but does not currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate any method of clearing that does not disturb the soil or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channel bottom. Thus, the ongoing use of herbicides to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetation from Cuyamaca Lake reservoir is not regulated under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
404, although water quality certification must be obtained from the

No federally listed species inhabit vernally wet meadows in the

1991). However, these guidelines have not been entirely effective. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, implementation of plans to supply an equestrian campground with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water from a well at Filaree Flat in the Laguna Mountains may alter

A late season grazing regime has been enacted at several of these meadows (Winter 1991; Volgarino, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but does not prevent entry by hikers or mountain bikers. In some cases,

plants that remain unprotected within campgrounds are severely trampled

 by virtue of their small population size and restricted distribution. The likelihood of finding a normal distribution
of genetic variability is reduced in small populations (Jensen 1987). Reduced genetic variability may lower the
ability of these populations to survive. The potential for local extirpation due to small population size can be exacerbated
by environmental conditions such as drought, flooding, or fire (Gilpin and Soule 1986, Falk and Holsinger 1991).

 in the National Forest and private land holdings. As discussed under factor D above, several measures were initiated
during the past decade to protect the vernally wet meadow ecosystem and associated sensitive plant species at Cuyamaca
State Park and the Cleveland National Forest. However, these measures have not prevented trampling by hikers and
horses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Introduced species of grasses and forbs have invaded many of California's plant communities. Such weedy species
can displace the native flora by out competing them for nutrients, water, light, and space. Weedy plant invasions
are facilitated by disturbances such as grazing, urban and residential developments, and various recreational
activities. Introduced weeds have become established in many portions of the Laguna Mountains thereby reducing
the amount of suitable habitat for native plant species (Sproul 1979). For example, the invasion of exotic species
including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lolium perenne
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (ryegrass) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Poa pratensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Kentucky bluegrass) has altered the composition of habitats supporting the two plant taxa under consideration
in this proposed rule (Sproul 1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trampling by livestock typically changes the composition of native plant communities by reducing or eliminating
those species that cannot withstand trampling and predation (see Factors A and C), and enabling more resistant (usually
exotic) species to increase in abundance. Introduction of seed from non-sterile hay and animal feces increases the
likelihood of invasion of exotic species and prevents re-establishment of native plants. Taxa that were not previously
part of the native flora may be introduced and flourish under a grazing regime and may reduce or eliminate native plant
species through competition for resources. Grazing is considered to be a threat to all populations of

sensitive plant habitats (Winter 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 is in imminent danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range due to habitat destruction
and degradation resulting from hydrologic alterations, grazing, trampling by recreational activities, the inadequacy
of existing regulatory mechanisms, an increased probability of stochastic extinction, and competition from exotic
plant species. The Service considered threatened status for this species, but determined that it such status would
not be in keeping with the purposes of the Act because the single remaining population consists of only 8 to 23 stands
within a restricted range, and is at risk of extirpation due to stochastic events such as water inundation. Therefore,
the preferred action is to list

Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose designation of critical habitat at the time a species is proposed for listing as endangered or threatened.
Section 4(b)(6)(C) further indicates that a concurrent critical habitat designation is not required if the Service
finds that a prompt determination of endangered or threatened status is essential to the conservation of the involved
species, or that critical habitat is not then determinable. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat

 that would not likely be imperiled by the threat of vandalism, collecting, or other human activities. Section 7(a)(2)
of the Act requires Federal agencies to insure that their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical

 on National Forest land would receive this added benefit from critical habitat designation. On non-federal land,
additional protection may be provided as a result of the increased public awareness afforded by the critical habitat
designation. In addition, the designation of critical habitat could be useful for State landowners and local regulatory
agencies to identify areas of special concern and to establish priorities for land management and acquisition. Designation
of critical habitat would be likely to result in more attention and hence protection by the State and county agencies
(J. Shu, pers. comm., 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other impacts of designating a particular
area as critical habitat. The Service must evaluate the effects of activities that occur within the ranges of these
plants, and gather data on precise habitat requirements and ownership boundaries in order to precisely define the
critical habitat of these two plant taxa. In addition, the Service must analyze the economics impacts that could result
from the designation of particular areas as critical habitat. Designation of critical habitat for

a prompt determination of endangered or threatened status for these species is essential to ensure the full benefits
of conservation measures under the Act. The Service intends to propose a critical habitat designation at a later date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(4) requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.

The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR section 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered, and 17.71
and 17.72 for threatened species, set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered
or threatened plants. With respect to

, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61 or 17.71, would apply. These prohibitions,
in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to import or export, transport
in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale any such species in
interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possession any such species from areas under Federal jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions provided that a statement
of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers. In addition, for listed plants, the 1988 amendments (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;478) to the Act prohibit the malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands and the removal, cutting,
digging up, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation, including
State criminal trespass law. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.
The Act and 50 CFR 17.62, 17.63, and 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited
activities involving endangered or threatened species under certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plants under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63. Such permits are available
for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species. Trade permits will not likely be sought
or issued for any of the plant species considered herein because they are not in cultivation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regarding them should be addressed to the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon, 97232&hyph;4181 (telephone
503/231&hyph;6241).

The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant
to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this
determination was published in the

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is asking for public comment about whether and how the agency should develop
regulations that would establish requirements for a new comprehensive food safety assurance program for both domestically
produced and imported foods. Such regulations, if promulgated, would enhance FDA's ability to ensure the safety
of the U.S. food supply. In this document, FDA is proposing that this program be based upon the principles of Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP). FDA is requesting comments on a number of specific issues, as well as on
all aspects of such a food safety program.

A. Status of the Food Safety Assurance Program in the United States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FDA's mandate to ensure the safety of the nation's food supply is derived principally from the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Under the act, FDA has authority to ensure that all foods in interstate commerce, or that have been shipped in interstate
commerce, are not contaminated or otherwise adulterated, are produced under sanitary conditions, and are not misbranded
or deceptively packaged
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
. The agency also has authority to ensure food safety under the Public Health Service Act (the PHS act) (42 U.S.C. 264),
which relates to the control of the spread of communicable diseases from one State, territory, or possession to another,
or from outside the United States into this country.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two other Federal agencies share with FDA the responsibility for regulating the safety of the food supply. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) has authority under the Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601), the Poultry Inspection
Act (21 U.S.C. 451), and the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031) to inspect facilities in which meat, poultry,
and eggs, respectively, are processed, and to regulate such products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
has authority, under provisions of the act, to establish legal limits (tolerances) for residues of pesticides on
foods. FDA and USDA enforce such tolerances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To carry out its mandate to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, FDA conducts periodic inspections of food processors,
shippers, food packers and repackers, food labelers and relabelers, and food warehouses. Some inspections are carried
out by the States, under contract with FDA. In addition, although subject to FDA jurisdiction, the many hundreds of
thousands of retail food outlets and restaurants in the United States are inspected by State and local health departments
with technical assistance and training from FDA. FDA's program to ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply also includes
sample analyses of food offered for import, research into rapid detection methodologies for potential hazards,
enforcement activities, and education and information sharing programs. The goal of all of these regulatory and
enforcement activities is to ensure that the food supply is, and remains, safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the current food safety assurance program has generally functioned effectively, it currently faces new
stresses and challenges. New food processing and packaging technologies, new food distribution and consumption
patterns, increasing public health concerns about low levels of certain chemical contaminants, and new microbial
pathogens all contribute to today's food safety challenge. For example, the composition of the food supply has changed
dramatically in the 55 years since passage of the act. More people consume commercially processed or commercially
prepared foods than ever before, and there is increased consumer demand for ``fresh'' foods in convenient, ready-to-cook
forms, which has fostered the development of sophisticated processing and packaging systems that can significantly
extend the shelf life of a variety of foods. However, new food safety risks can be associated with these new food products,
new packages, and new patterns of distribution and consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the most important challenges to FDA's current food safety assurance program is the increasing number of new
food pathogens. Although food borne illness has always been a public health problem, such illness appears to be on
the rise, and new pathogens are appearing (Ref. 1). In addition, because foods are more extensively processed and
handled, there is now a greater opportunity for food to be contaminated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food borne illness is a major cause of morbidity in the United States; estimates of the yearly incidence of food borne
illness vary greatly, ranging from 6.5 million (Ref. 1) to 12.6 million cases per year (Ref. 2), and from 24 to 81 million
cases per year (Ref. 3). In the 15 years between 1973 and 1988, the number of recognized food borne pathogens broadened
considerably. During that period, bacteria not previously recognized as important food borne pathogens emerged,
including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and a variety of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. During that same period, experts recognized that certain food borne illnesses may be followed by serious complications,
such as arthritis, kidney damage, heart disease, and neurological damage (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pathogens are not the only potential contaminants of food, however. The extensive use of industrial chemicals, coupled
with past failures to deal adequately with chemical waste, have resulted in significant chemical pollution of the
environment in some regions. Many of these chemicals have found their way into the food chain. The legal use of pesticides
in agriculture may also result in residues in food. Naturally occurring chemicals, such as toxic elements and mycotoxins,
can also be found in food at levels of concern. The sheer number of these potential contaminants, the concerns about
their toxicity even at very low levels, and the difficulty and expense associated with many of the analytical methods
used to quantify their levels in food, make exhaustive endpoint monitoring of the food supply virtually impossible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The size and diversity of the food industry adds to the stress on the current food safety assurance program. FDA's current
inventory lists over 30,000 food manufacturers and processors, and in excess of 20,000 food warehouses. The number
of foreign manufacturers and processors shipping food products to the United States continues to increase. In 1992,
there were well over 1 million food import entries into the United States. In addition, the diversity of food imports
continues to increase, with a rising volume of foods entering the United States in processed forms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the current food safety program is under stress internally. It is unlikely that FDA will ever have sufficient
resources to inspect, sample, and analyze more than a small percentage of imported food shipments. State and local
governments, on which FDA relies heavily for surveillance of the growing retail food sector, are also under severe
resource constraints. Indeed, some States are considering proposals to reduce their food safety programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's current regulatory strategy for ensuring food safety, with its emphasis on periodic visual inspection of food
facilities and end-product testing, was designed to control the problems that were known to exist when the act was
established in 1938. The agency has struggled to keep up with the enormous growth and changes in the food industry and
the resulting new food safety challenges. FDA's current regulatory approach is relatively resource intensive and
inefficient compared to other ways of ensuring food safety. Inspections that FDA conducts under the current system
can determine the adequacy of conditions in a food plant at the time of the inspection but not whether the company has
in place a food safety assurance program that is operating reliably and consistently to produce safe food at all times.
Furthermore, the current inspectional approach is generally reactive, not preventive. It is effective in detecting
and correcting problems after they occur, but, except in certain limited areas such as the regulation of infant formula
and low acid canned foods, it is not currently based on a system of preventive controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of these reasons, FDA believes that it is appropriate at this time for the agency to consider improvements to
its food safety assurance program to focus the program on prevention of food safety risks and problems. FDA's goals
in establishing additional food safety regulations would be to: (1) Make the food supply safer through prevention
of food safety problems; (2) enable FDA and its State and local counterparts to make more efficient use of the existing
resources devoted to ensuring food safety, and (3) enhance the ability of the Federal Government to provide consumers
with the assurance they seek that the U.S. food supply is safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that risks vary across the food supply and that measures to make food safer should focus on the potential
of particular foods or possible contaminants in those foods to cause illness. The agency also recognizes that there
is no proven method or approach for ensuring the safety of food that will eliminate risk in all circumstances. Indeed,
one purpose of this notice is to seek public comment on the degree of potential risks posed by those microorganisms,
chemicals, and physical hazards (e.g., broken glass) that can get into food and be passed on to the consumer, if appropriate
care is not exercised. FDA also desires comments on the consequences of these risks if they occur. In addition, the
agency seeks comment on how these risks can best be controlled and which systems of quality control can best protect
consumers from potentially unsafe food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency has reached no final conclusions about how its regulatory programs should be revised to make food
as safe as possible, FDA has tentatively concluded that the improvements in the agency's current food safety assurance
program should be based on a state-of-the-art, preventive approach known as HACCP. HACCP was developed approximately
30 years ago by the U.S. food industry, and it is currently used in a number of domestic food processing facilities.
HACCP is internationally regarded as the most effective system for producing safe food. FDA is considering HACCP
as the foundation for revision of the U.S. food safety assurance program because, although simple in its basic concepts,
HACCP is a sophisticated and powerful tool for ensuring food safety. HACCP is a science based, systematic approach
to preventing food safety problems by anticipating how such problems are most likely to occur and by installing effective
measures to prevent them from occurring. HACCP thus requires that the processor and the regulatory authority be aware
of the state-of-the-art science relative to food safety and processing technology. HACCP appropriately affirms
that the food industry has primary responsibility for producing safe food, and it provides an important opportunity
to link the food industry's system for producing safe food with the Government's system of regulatory oversight.
A more in-depth discussion of the HACCP concept follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The HACCP System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HACCP concept (Ref. 4) is a systematic approach to the identification, assessment of risk (likelihood of occurrence
and severity), and control of the biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with a particular food production
process or practice. HACCP is a preventive strategy. It is based on development by the food producer of a plan that anticipates
food safety hazards and identifies the points in the production process where a failure would likely result in a hazard
being created or allowed to persist; these points are referred to as critical control points (CCP's). Under HACCP,
identified CCP's are systematically monitored, and records kept of that monitoring. Corrective actions are taken
when control of a CCP is lost, including proper disposition of the food produced during that period, and these actions
are documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the HACCP system for the food industry will underscore the industry's role in continuous problem prevention
and problem solving, rather than relying solely on traditional facility inspections by regulatory agencies to detect
loss of control. HACCP provides for real time monitoring procedures to assess the effectiveness of control. Each
HACCP plan would reflect the uniqueness of a food, its method of processing, and the facility in which it is prepared.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP has been endorsed by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF) as an effective
and rational means of ensuring food safety from harvest to table. The NACMCF was established in 1988 by USDA in conjunction
with FDA to fulfill a recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences, and includes officials from FDA, USDA, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Defense, as well as experts from academia
and the food industry. HACCP is also recognized in the international food safety community as the state-of-the-art
means to ensure the safety and integrity of food. In particular, the Committee on Food Hygiene of the United Nations'
Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) has endorsed the HACCP concept as a world wide guideline. Indeed, the European
Union (EU) and other countries around the world have begun to require that foods produced within their borders be processed
under HACCP requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NACMCF has developed the following seven principles that describe the HACCP concept:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Hazard Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first step in the establishment of a HACCP system for a food process or practice is the identification of the hazards
associated with the product. The NACMCF defines a hazard as a biological, chemical, or physical property that may
cause a food to be unsafe for consumption. The hazard analysis step should include an assessment of both the likelihood
that such a hazard will occur and its severity if it does occur. This analysis should also involve the establishment
of preventive measures to control identified hazards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Identification of CCP's
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A CCP is a point, step, or procedure at which control can be applied, the result being that a potential food safety hazard
can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced to acceptable levels. Points in the manufacturing process that may be CCP's
include cooking, chilling, specific sanitation procedures, product formulation control, prevention of cross
contamination, and certain aspects of employee and environmental hygiene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Establishment of Critical Limits for Preventive Measures Associated With Each Identified CCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This step involves establishing a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with a CCP. Critical
limits can be thought of as boundaries of safety for each CCP and may be set for preventive measures such as temperature,
time, physical dimensions, moisture level, water activity, pH, and available chlorine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Establishment of Procedures to Monitor CCP's
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monitoring is a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a CCP is under control and to produce
an accurate record for use in future verification procedures. Continuous monitoring is possible with many types
of physical and chemical methods. When it is not possible to monitor a critical limit on a continuous basis, monitoring
intervals must be frequent enough to permit the manufacturer to determine whether the step/process/procedure designed
to control the hazard is under control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Establishment of Corrective Actions To Be Taken When Monitoring Shows That a Critical Limit Has Been Exceeded
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the HACCP system is intended to prevent deviations in a planned process from occurring, total prevention can
rarely, if ever, be achieved. Therefore, there must be a corrective action plan in place to ensure appropriate disposition
of any food produced during a deviation, to fix or correct the cause of noncompliance to ensure that the CCP is once again
under control, and to maintain records of corrective actions taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Establishment of Effective Recordkeeping Systems That Document the HACCP System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This principle requires the preparation and maintenance of a written HACCP plan that lists the hazards, CCP's, and
critical limits identified by the firm, as well as the monitoring, recordkeeping, and other procedures that the firm
intends to use to implement the plan. This principle also requires the maintenance of records generated during the
operation of the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Establishment of Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System is Working
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This process involves verifying that the critical limits are adequate to control the hazards identified, ensuring
that the HACCP plan is working properly and verifying that there is documented, periodic revalidation of the plan
to confirm that the plan is still performing its intended function under existing plant conditions at any point in
time.

C. FDA's Authority to Mandate HACCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA proposed regulations that would require HACCP controls in the seafood industry.
The agency believes that it is now appropriate to explore the application of HACCP to segments of the industry other
than seafood. At this time the agency would plan to proceed in a stepwise fashion with those segments of the industry
that are suitable candidates for adoption of HACCP principles. This document is intended to explore how the agency
should pursue that broader HACCP program. FDA is doing so because the agency believes that such a program would be an
effective and efficient way to ensure that food meets the act's safety standards and to implement section 402(a)(4)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(4)). As explained below, if FDA proceeds with a HACCP proposal covering additional segments
of the food industry, such proposal would be made pursuant to the authority of sections 402 and 701(a) of the act (21
U.S.C. 371(a)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 201 of the act defines the term ``food'' as ``articles used for food or drink for man or other animals.'' Under
section 402(a)(4) of the act, a food is deemed adulterated if it has been ``prepared, packed, or held under insanitary
conditions whereby it may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby it may have been rendered injurious to health.''
Proof that a food is actually contaminated or otherwise hazardous is not required to establish that a food is adulterated
under section 402(a)(4) of the act. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, 502 F.2d 700, 704 (7th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1007 (1975).) Instead, such adulteration requires only
a showing that the conditions under which food is prepared, packed, or held create a ``reasonable possibility'' of
contamination. (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 200 F.2d 818, 821 (8th Cir. 1952).)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its enforcement of section 402(a)(4) of the act, FDA has considered, among other things, prevailing industry standards
and the technical state-of-the-art in determining, on a case-by-case basis, whether the conditions under which
a company is processing or otherwise handling food violate the standard of section 402 (a)(4). FDA's current intention
is to propose to codify, in a future rulemaking, a state-of-the-art standard based upon HACCP principles. This standard
would establish those conditions of food manufacturing, packing, and holding that are consistent with section 402(a)(4)
of the act. Such regulations would thus ensure the agency's efficient enforcement of section 402(a)(4) and the other
food safety provisions of the act, as authorized by section 701(a) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this juncture, the regulations that FDA is considering for proposal would specify the requirements that the agency
believes are the minimum necessary to ensure that food products under FDA's jurisdiction are not adulterated under
section 402(a)(4) of the act. Under the program that FDA is considering, if a food purveyor covered by the program does
not adopt and implement a HACCP plan that complies with the program's requirements or does not operate the plan in accordance
with the program, food prepared, packed, or held in that facility would be adulterated under section 402(a) (4) of
the act and potentially subject to regulatory action by FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Rationale for a HACCP Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA expects that adoption of HACCP by some or all segments of the food industry, coupled with Government verification
through inspections of the HACCP system, will more effectively and efficiently ensure the safety of the American
food supply. The agency has tentatively chosen a HACCP approach because HACCP addresses the root causes of food safety
problems in production, storage, transportation, etc., and is preventive. Two principal alternatives to HACCP
exist; end-product testing and comprehensive current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations. End-product
testing does not address the root causes of food safety problems; it is not preventive by design and requires that a
large number of samples be analyzed to ensure product integrity. Similarly, CGMP's are not a practical approach because
of the breadth and diversity of the food industry, the limited resources available within FDA to prepare the many specific
CGMP regulations that would be needed to cover effectively such a diverse industry, and the time required to implement
such regulations. However, FDA may consider the promulgation of CGMP's for certain food processes or types if such
regulations would be more effective than a HACCP system for such processes. For example, some of the comments have
suggested that sanitation would be better addressed through CGMP's than through a HACCP plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A HACCP system for food safety assurance has numerous distinct advantages including the following: (1) HACCP focuses
on prevention and is designed to prevent hazards from entering food; (2) HACCP permits more effective and efficient
Government oversight; (3) HACCP places primary responsibility for ensuring food safety appropriately on the food
manufacturer/distributor; and (4) HACCP assists food companies in competing more effectively in the world market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of any HACCP system is to prevent problems through the systematic analysis and control of the production
system by industry. This analysis and control would be confirmed by Government verification of the industry's monitoring.
As such, a HACCP approach provides an appropriate balance between the responsibilities of industry and Government
in ensuring food safety. A HACCP based program will also allow FDA and its State and local government counterparts
to conduct more efficient and focused inspections of food facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to being preventive in nature and more efficient, a HACCP approach offers two additional benefits over
conventional inspection techniques. First, in contrast to FDA's current regulatory approach, a HACCP approach
requires industry to analyze, in a rational, scientific manner, its production processes in order to identify CCP's
and to establish critical limits and monitoring procedures. An essential part of the industry's role under HACCP
is to establish and maintain records to document adherence to the critical limits relating to the identified CCP's,
which will result in continuous self inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, HACCP allows the regulator to monitor more effectively a firm's compliance with food safety laws. With its
current system of inspection, FDA can determine the conditions at a food plant only during the period of inspection.
The agency must therefore make assumptions about conditions before and after the inspection based on a snapshot of
plant conditions and practices at the time of the inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With an HACCP-based program in place, an investigator can determine and evaluate both current and past conditions
critical to ensuring the safety of food produced by the facility. As discussed above, an essential part of a HACCP system
is maintenance of monitoring records. By examining such records, the Government inspector can, in effect, look back
through time at the conditions of a facility. Under the proposal that FDA currently envisions, the agency would have
access to CCP monitoring records to verify that the HACCP plan is working. Government monitoring under a HACCP system
would provide assurance that systems of preventive controls are in place and functioning properly and thus afford
greater public assurance of food safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Federal inspection and surveillance strategies attempt to gauge the industry's knowledge of hazards and
preventive control measures largely by inference, i.e., whether a company's products are in fact adulterated, or
whether conditions in a plant are in compliance with CGMP's. Consequently, the current inspection system places
a great deal of responsibility on Government regulators to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to address
those problems. Under a HACCP-based inspection system, it would be the responsibility of the company to develop a
plan for producing safe food, and the role of Government inspectors would be to verify that the company is carrying
out its plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, adopting a HACCP system could potentially enhance international trade opportunities for the United States.
Although enhancing trade has no direct effect on public health, participation in international trade in food products
is critical to the U.S. economy. The United States is by far the world's major food exporter, with exports of raw agricultural
and processed food products of over $40 billion per year. The United States also imports a substantial quantity of
food products each year from many countries around the world. HACCP will improve FDA's ability to monitor such imports
and thus ensure confidence in their safety. Also, HACCP is becoming the world-wide standard to ensure the safety of
food and will thus serve as basis for harmonizing U.S. food safety regulations with those of other nations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Uruguay Round negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has resulted in further focus
on this area. The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures states the desire of member
countries, including the United States, to further ``* * * the use of harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures
between members, on the basis of international standards, guidelines and recommendations developed by the relevant
international organizations, including the Codex Alimentarius Commission * * *'' (Ref. 5). This trend toward harmonization,
coupled with the current recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius Commission encouraging the international use
of HACCP, provide further support for FDA's serious consideration of a HACCP program for all or part of the food industry.

E. How the Agency Intends to Proceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA began its initiative to mandate HACCP with a proposal covering the seafood industry due in large part to the fact
that a substantial amount of work on the application of HACCP to seafood processing and importation, including the
development of specific HACCP models, has already been done by the Federal Government, some States, academia, and
by the seafood industry itself. Thus, there is a considerable body of literature and expertise, which can facilitate
the development of HACCP systems by seafood processors and importers. Moreover, seafood industry representatives
have been urging the Federal Government to adopt a mandatory HACCP program. The National Fisheries Institute, the
largest seafood industry trade association, has testified repeatedly at congressional hearings in support of legislation
that would mandate such a system. The agency recommends that interested persons refer to the seafood proposal to understand
how the HACCP approach might work with respect to one category of food product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The body of knowledge and experience on the application of HACCP to food production has not, as far as the agency is aware,
been developed for other commodities to the extent that it has for seafood. (One possible exception is the low acid
canned food industry, where much work has been done in HACCP's application due to FDA's long standing regulatory program
for this industry.) Moreover, the food industry is extremely diverse and complex. For these reasons, FDA has decided
to issue this advance notice of proposed rulemaking to request comments on various aspects of the implementation
of a mandatory HACCP program for some or all other sectors of the food industry. Those comments may suggest that an industry-wide
HACCP requirement is appropriate or may indicate that such a program should be phased-in as data on individual commodities
is compiled. FDA is open to any other suggestions. Specific issues on which FDA is particularly interested in receiving
comments are set out below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it could benefit from experience with the application of HACCP to selected commodities outside
the seafood area. To gain this experience the agency has announced a voluntary pilot HACCP program and invited interested
food producers to participate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the objectives of this pilot program are to obtain data on the hazards associated with particular types of food,
and to develop and implement HACCP plans to control those hazards in conjunction with the participating firms. The
pilot program could provide the agency and the industry with the practical knowledge and experience that would assist
in the development and implementation of a HACCP program for particular segments of the food industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that an ongoing exchange of scientific, technical, and operational information between the agency,
the food industry, trade associations, consumer groups, FDA's State and local counterparts, and other affected
parties is essential for the successful implementation of HACCP in the food industry. Consequently, FDA intends
to maintain a dialogue with all affected parties during the process of developing its proposed regulations. In particular,
FDA will meet with the food industry, consumer groups, and other interested parties during the comment period on this
advance notice of proposed rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA anticipates that it will receive a substantial number of comments in response to this document. The agency will
review these comments and have further dialogue with industry and consumer representatives, as well as other groups
and organizations knowledgeable in food safety, as part of its process for determining the appropriate regulatory
approach prior to publication of a proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends to work closely with USDA, as it considers development of its own HACCP regulations for meat and poultry
products, to ensure that the two regulatory bodies have a consistent approach in applying HACCP principles to the
food industry, while recognizing that inherent differences may exist between food commodity groups that will necessitate
different approaches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also intends to work closely with its State and local counterparts that regulate the retail segment of the food
industry. One principal way FDA conveys its recommended food regulatory policy to the nation's State and local food
control agencies is through FDA's model Food Code. A notice of availability of the latest revision of the Food Code,
which incorporates certain HACCP principles and terminology, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4085).

II. Request for Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the act, the food industry has the primary responsibility for ensuring the safety of the food it produces and
distributes. In its simplest terms, the role of Government is to verify that the industry is carrying out its responsibility
and to initiate regulatory or other appropriate action when the industry fails to do so. FDA believes that establishing
a HACCP program throughout the food industry could enable both the industry and FDA to carry out their respective responsibilities
far more efficiently and effectively. FDA invites comments on this point, as well as on specific issues relating to
the application of HACCP to foods other than seafood, as set out below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope of a HACCP Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NACMCF supports the adoption of HACCP throughout the food industry ((Ref. 4). Additionally, the Codex Ailmentarius
Committee on Food Hygiene considers HACCP to be the most efficient and cost effective means to manage food safety (Ref.
4). FDA recognizes, however, that not all foods pose the same inherent risks. The agency intends to work with the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and other Federal and State agencies as well as health professionals, industry,
and consumer groups to access and evaluate data on the relative risks associated with various foods. FDA has concluded
that HACCP has great potential to improve food safety and can be successfully used beyond seafood. However, specific
HACCP requirements established for the various segments of the industry may be different because of differences
in risk as well as differences in processes, etc. The agency encourages the food industry generally to begin using
HACCP more widely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA specifically requests comments on the scope of any mandatory HACCP program proposed by the agency. Should FDA
mandate HACCP for all segments of the food industry? Or should HACCP be required only for certain segments of the food
industry? In deciding whether to cover all or some segments of the food industry by a mandatory HACCP rule, what criteria
should FDA use? In particular, should any exclusions from a HACCP requirement be determined on any basis other than
the risk presented by the particular activity? Are there categories of activities, such as the warehousing of certain
types of foodstuffs, that deserve exclusion?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also requests comment on how a mandatory HACCP rule should apply to those in the chain of distribution of
imported foods. How should the agency ensure that imported foods are produced and handled safely? In the seafood proposal,
FDA is proposing that all domestic and foreign processors and importers adopt HACCP controls, and FDA is proposing
to take steps to ensure that the HACCP controls are in fact implemented by foreign processors. The seafood proposal
broadly defines ``processor'' to include packers, repackers, wholesalers, and warehousers. Should the agency
adopt the same approach with respect to foreign processors, handlers, and importers of all other foods? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also solicits comments on whether and how a mandatory HACCP rule should apply to food retailers. The agency's seafood
proposal specifically excludes retailers from the definition of ``processor.'' Should a similar exclusion be made
for retailers of all other foods as well? The agency notes that its updated Food Code, which serves as guidance to the
States as part of an ongoing cooperative program for regulating the retail sector, incorporates several HACCP elements.
The agency requests comment on this cooperative program for the retail sector and on how governments at all levels
can best collaborate to ensure the safety of food from farm or fishery to the dinner table, including food sold ready-to-eat
at the retail level. Should HACCP be required in restaurants and other retail outlets? Should HACCP requirements
be applied directly to raw material suppliers and transportation companies? Or should such requirements be imposed
indirectly through the HACCP plans of processors and others who receive food (e.g., by using purchase specifications)?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also specifically requests comment on how small firms should be covered by any mandatory HACCP regulations. In
the seafood proposal, FDA has made no distinctions in the application of proposed requirements based on firm size.
If small firms should be exempt, on what basis should the exemption be made? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Focus of HACCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NACMCF believes that HACCP and HACCP plans should address food safety, including all biological, chemical, and physical
hazards that would affect a particular food. Consistent with this view, FDA has limited the scope of the HACCP requirements
in the seafood proposal to safety concerns and has not included food quality and labeling standards and requirements.
Although the agency believes that the primary focus of a HACCP program should be safety, FDA is aware that food quality
is also important to consumers and is an issue in international trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should FDA's HACCP program for the broader food industry be limited to food safety and the hazards presented by a particular
activity? If so, how broadly should hazard be defined? What level of risk warrants HACCP-type control? Should different
levels of control be required in HACCP plans for different levels of risk? Or should FDA's proposal mandate that food
quality issues be included in HACCP plans? Should sanitation practices within the plant be required to be included
in HACCP plans?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Implementation of HACCP
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that, because of the size and diversity of the overall food industry, any mandatory HACCP program would
likely be costly for some segments of the food industry and need to be phased in gradually. Development of HACCP plans
would require at least some segments of the industry to adopt new ways of thinking and operating. Review by FDA of HACCP
plans and monitoring records as part of its plant inspections would necessitate additional training of FDA, State,
and local investigators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the scope of the task, what would be a reasonable time period for the implementation of HACCP? In the seafood
proposal, FDA is proposing a 1-year period for implementation, measured from the date of the final regulations. This
proposed lead time takes into account the fact that a considerable amount of developmental work has already been done
on the application of HACCP to seafood processing. Are there special considerations for other types of foods that
could affect implementation time? Are there circumstances that would require some industry segments to need an implementation
period longer than 1 year after final rule promulgation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If implementation of HACCP is to be phased in (i.e., certain segments would gradually be subject to the HACCP requirements
established), how should this be accomplished? How should firms or segments of the food industry be differentiated
for purposes of such a phased in implementation? What would be appropriate time intervals between each implementation
phase? What criteria should be used to decide the order of implementation for the various segments of the food industry?
For example, should potential food safety risks associated with the product be considered in determining an implementation
schedule, and if so, what factors should be used in ranking foods with respect to potential risk? Likewise, for example,
should firm size be considered in determining the order of implementation? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is interested in learning about the experiences that food manufacturers have had with the implementation
of HACCP and therefore requests comments from firms who have had actual experience in the application of HACCP concepts
to food production, both on what has worked and on what has not worked. In particular, FDA seeks information on: (1)
How long it took to implement a HACCP program; (2) the start-up and maintenance costs; and (3) the impact of implementing
HACCP on the safety of the product, the efficiency of the firm's operation, and any long-term savings (cost effectiveness).
The agency is also interested in any measures that have been, or could be, used to measure the effectiveness of HACCP
to improve product safety. The agency is particularly interested in the experiences of small food firms on all of the
above.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA believes that implementation of HACCP beyond the seafood industry, whether voluntary or mandatory, will more
effectively and efficiently ensure the safety of the American food supply. The agency recognizes, however, that
there may be alternatives to the HACCP approach and invites comment on such alternatives and their effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also invites comment on whether there are factors that would limit the effectiveness of the HACCP approach.
What information is needed in order to judge the effectiveness of a HACCP program? Should HACCP programs be pilot tested
before implementation? Should there be a minimum level of certainty that a HACCP plan would be effective in controlling
hazards prior to implementation?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What should be the qualifications of individuals responsible for developing HACCP plans? What should be the qualifications
of individuals responsible for verification of HACCP plans? Is the current state of knowledge sufficient to make
adequate hazard analyses? Is there a need for microbiological criteria in HACCP plans? Will end-product microbiological
testing be necessary?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How should the appropriate frequency of monitoring CCP's be determined? Should a processing plant be required to
submit a report to FDA each time a process is found to be out of control? What, if any, circumstances should trigger mandatory
reporting to FDA? Is it necessary to require that a food processor have a reliable and well-tested method of recall
as part of its HACCP plan?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Roles of FDA, the States, and the Food Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's interest in institutionalizing HACCP for the food industry is based on the agency's recognition of the need
to revise the current regulatory approach and make it more effective and comprehensive. This revision must coordinate
and maximize the efforts of all levels of Government and the food industry to provide effective coverage of food from
farm or fishery to table. The respective roles of industry, State and local authorities, and FDA must be clearly articulated,
and they must be integrated and coordinated. FDA's preliminary thinking on the nature of these respective roles follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA decides to make HACCP mandatory for some or all segments of the food industry, firms would be required to develop,
implement, and maintain an effective HACCP system in their facility, and to verify that the system is adequate to ensure
a safe product. The HACCP system developed by the firm would have to include all relevant critical limits (such as tolerances)
contained in existing FDA regulations and guidelines, as well as other CCP's judged necessary by the firm to ensure
the safety of the food. Firms would also be responsible for taking appropriate corrective actions whenever a CCP deviation
has occurred. The system would be considered out of compliance when a critical limit of a CCP has been exceeded and corrective
actions are not taken or are ineffective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulated industry segments would also be responsible for providing appropriate training for personnel involved
in implementing HACCP in each facility. Each facility would have to maintain an accurate, up-to-date HACCP plan,
which would be available for review by FDA investigators during an inspection. Records pertinent to the monitoring
of the CCP's in the HACCP plan would also have to be available for review by FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is seeking comment on the appropriateness of imposing these obligations on the food industry under a mandatory
HACCP system. The agency is especially interested in receiving comments on records access, including: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) What records should be considered HACCP records, and therefore be accessible to FDA (and State and local) investigators?
Under FDA's proposed HACCP regulations for seafood, HACCP records include the HACCP plan itself, records of the monitoring
of critical control points, and records of corrective actions. In the case of seafood, FDA tentatively concluded
that the agency should have access to all records deemed to be HACCP records, because without such access, the regulatory
requirements would not be meaningful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) How should consumer complaint files relating to CCP failures be utilized in a HACCP system? In FDA's proposed HACCP
regulations for seafood, the agency tentatively concluded that each HACCP system should take advantage of consumer
complaints as they relate to the operation of CCP's. The agency proposed that procedures for monitoring CCP's include
procedures for monitoring relevant consumer complaints, and that consumer complaints that potentially relate
to the performance of critical control points be considered HACCP records. FDA invites comment on this approach for
foods generally. Should FDA have access to consumer complaint files relating to CCP failures? What criteria should
be used to determine whether a consumer complaint is linked to a CCP failure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) How long should HACCP records be kept? The proposed HACCP regulations for seafood mandate 1 year for fresh products
and 2 years for frozen and preserved products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional matter, FDA is aware that there is substantial public interest in the extent to which industry-generated
HACCP records could or should be publicly available. FDA invites comment on the general question of public disclosure
of HACCP records and on the agency's preliminary analysis of the availability of such records, which follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has long had explicit statutory authority to obtain access to certain industry records during inspections involving
infant formula, drugs, and devices (21 U.S.C. 374), and has had access by virtue of agency regulations to certain processing
records during inspections of low acid canned food processors and manufacturers of infant formula. The agency has
the right to copy and take possession of these records, but does not routinely do so. FDA typically copies and takes
possession of records only when they may be needed for regulatory purposes. As a preliminary matter, FDA expects to
continue this practice with regard to HACCP records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public availability of those HACCP documents that would become part of FDA's official records as a result of copying
during an inspection would be governed by section 301(j) of the act and by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and
regulations issued under the FOIA by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by FDA. Section 301(j) of
the act expressly prohibits any person from disclosing trade secret information obtained during the course of an
inspection. The agency's FOIA regulations also state that FDA will not disclose either trade secret or confidential
commercial information. FDA's preliminary view is that HACCP plans and monitoring records fall within these two
categories of protected records. As a consequence, FDA may have little discretion to disclose such records. Moreover,
under HHS FOIA regulations, processors may be entitled to challenge in court a pending disclosure of records on the
ground that the records to be disclosed are confidential commercial or trade secret. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, there are significant legal and practical questions as to whether FDA has the authority to require
disclosure of industry records that are not in FDA's possession. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency is also seeking comments on whether there should be a standardized format (structure and organization)
for written HACCP plans. If so, how should this standard format be developed and who should develop it?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case today, the overall goal of FDA's inspection program would be to ensure that foods are safely prepared,
packed, and held. To achieve this goal under a HACCP system, FDA's inspection would seek to verify that a HACCP plan
is adequate to ensure food safety and that it is being implemented and maintained properly. The agency is seeking comments
on the appropriate frequency of agency inspections under a mandatory HACCP program to achieve its goal of ensuring
food safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also interested in receiving comments on the possible role that FDA could play to assist the food industry
in developing and establishing HACCP programs. This assistance could take the form of agency guidelines for developing
HACCP plans and generic HACCP plans developed in cooperation with the industry. FDA could also promote and participate
in educational programs to encourage the use of HACCP and FDA could continue to represent the United States at international
meetings on HACCP. The agency could work with interested groups to identify new food safety hazards and to develop
new strategies for their control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency expects that the States would play a major role in enhancing FDA's enforcement coverage. State authorities
could participate in HACCP inspections both as part of their own enforcement activities and under FDA contract. State
and local authorities could also be involved in actively promoting the use of HACCP at the retail level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is seeking comments on what its role should be relative to the review, verification, monitoring, and certification
of HACCP plans. In the seafood proposal, FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP plans be submitted to FDA in advance,
or that preapproval by FDA be a condition of the adoption or implementation of these plans. If FDA proposes to make HACCP
mandatory for other portions of the food industry, should it adopt this approach? Should FDA indentify CCP's and establish
critical limits in its HACCP regulation, or should it defer to firms to develop these themselves? What role should
FDA serve in overseeing the corrective actions taken when a deviation has occurred? Can any HACCP oversight function,
including review of plans and monitoring, be performed by certified third parties? If so, how should they be certified
and by whom?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For implementation of HACCP for fish and fishery products, FDA is developing guidelines for processors. These guidelines
inventory and describe the likely hazards associated with both products and processes, and provide advice on how
these hazards can be controlled. These guidelines also include a fill-in-the-blank HACCP plan to serve as an example
of how a basic HACCP plan could be developed. Are such guidelines necessary for other commodities and, if so, who should
develop them? What specifically should be included? What role should the food industry play in the development of
these materials? What other forms of assistance should FDA provide? To what extent, if any, should any of this additional
guidance be made mandatory?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Training and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency's experience with low acid canned foods established that appropriate training is critical to the successful
implementation of HACCP in the food industry. The industry will need training on how to develop HACCP plans, i.e.,
how to identify hazards and establish critical limits, control measures, corrective actions, and recordkeeping
procedures. Investigators employed by regulatory agencies, including FDA, will need training to understand how
to review HACCP plans as well as industry records pertaining to implementation and operation of such plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon its low acid canned food experience, FDA believes that employee training is an essential element of an effective
HACCP program. Should FDA mandate training for plant personnel responsible for developing and maintaining the HACCP
program? In the seafood proposal, FDA is proposing to require that each processor and importer employ at least one
individual who has successfully completed a training course on the application of HACCP to fish and fishery products
processing. Moreover, the regulations propose to require that those at each establishment who have received training
be responsible for reviewing records of CCP monitoring, recognizing critical limit deficiencies, and assessing
the need for corrective actions relative to the product in question and the HACCP plan itself. FDA seeks comment on
the question of training. Are there reasons why such training should not be mandated? If such training is required,
as FDA currently believes it should be, who should conduct these training courses? Who should be required to attend?
What role, if any, should FDA have regarding course materials and instructors? Should a third party be certified by
FDA to review and approve the training courses? Should one, some, or all responsible plant employees be certified?

G. International Harmonization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the international community moves toward HACCP, FDA believes an opportunity exists to improve the safety of the
U.S. food supply by working toward harmonized approaches that would elevate FDA's confidence that food entering
the United States meets U.S. safety standards. Such harmonization would also support U.S. exports. For example,
after January 1, 1995, unless seafood products for import into the EU are produced under HACCP, the EU will carry out
extensive end-product testing, and the competitiveness of importers will be significantly affected. How should
FDA approach any effort to harmonize HACCP standards with those of other countries? What role should the Codex play?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Potential Costs and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is also requesting relevant economic information. In particular, FDA seeks estimates of the following
costs: (1) The initial costs of developing a HACCP plan and the frequency and costs of altering the plan; (2) costs of
monitoring and recordkeeping by type of process, product, and packaging, and the costs of reviewing records before
shipment; (3) costs of necessary training of employees, and rate of turnover of employees; (4) administrative costs
to oversee all phases of HACCP implementation and operation; (5) the cost of monitoring equipment and other types
of equipment needed to implement a HACCP program; (6) the cost and frequency of corrective actions when critical limits
are exceeded; (7) the potential cost to the industry of FDA inspections of HACCP programs; (8) cost of testing for chemical
and contaminant residues as a component of HACCP; (9) cost of process redesign; (10) cost of new product design; and
(11) the costs of any consultants that might be required under a HACCP approach. FDA also seeks comments about the costs
of expanding HACCP to elements of the food industry other than manufacturers and processors, such as retail supermarkets
and restaurants, food transporters, and raw material suppliers. FDA is particularly interested in the cost experience
of small firms who have implemented HACCP, and how HACCP implementation by these firms is different from that of large
firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also announcing its intention to survey the food processing industry (except for seafood) to estimate the costs
of complying with mandatory HACCP requirements and requests comments on how such a survey should be designed and implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also interested in receiving comments on benefits of mandating HACCP for particular products, processes,
and packaging. Thus, FDA is seeking information about the existing risk levels presented by various foods, including
risk from microorganisms, contaminants, and chemical residues from all interested parties, including State and
other Federal agencies. FDA is also interested in receiving information concerning any quantitative reductions
in risk that have been documented by firms now using HACCP, or other evidence that would document that illness or other
food borne risks have been reduced through use of HACCP. FDA also is interested in receiving information that documents
savings in production costs or indirect benefits, such as increased quality, that firms using HACCP have experienced.
Because many risks are the result of consumer mishandling, FDA requests comments on the extent of this source of illness
or other food borne risks, and how this information should be used to target HACCP efforts. Finally, FDA requests comments
on the benefits of extending HACCP to the other areas of the food industry that are mentioned above.

I. Potential Environmental Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is also requesting relevant environmental information because, under the National Environmental Policy
Act, FDA must consider the environmental impact of its actions. The agency does not currently possess the data that
would permit detailed analysis of the environmental impact of the action under consideration by the agency, as described
in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is requesting information on the potential environmental impact including: (1) Potential
for increased energy consumption, (2) potential for increased disposal of defective foods, (3) potential for new
or increased disposal of sanitizing products, (4) a description of measures that could be taken to avoid or mitigate
adverse environmental impacts that might result from this action, and (5) potential for increased paper consumption.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, Homer L. Wilkes, Acting State
Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed
for this project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project concerns a watershed plan for the purpose of reducing water quality and flood damages to the rural community
of Hambrick. The planned works of improvement consists of 2.6 miles of channel enlargement and 21,500 feet of sewer
system to connect the houses in Hambrick to an existing permitted waste treatment facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
are on file and may be reviewed by contacting Homer L. Wilkes.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that coumarin from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be, sold
in the United States at less than fair value (LTFV), as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the
Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. We have also determined
that critical circumstances exist.

Case History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on January 19, 1994, (59 FR 3841, January 27, 1994), the following events
have occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 31, 1994, we sent a survey to the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) and certain
companies in the PRC requesting information on production and sales of coumarin exported to the United States. The
names of the companies were found in the petition and in data supplied by the Port Import Export Reporting Service (PIERS).
We requested MOFTEC's assistance in forwarding the survey to all exporters and producers of coumarin and in submitting
complete responses on their behalf.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 14, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of Commerce (the Department)
of its preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially
injured by reason of imports of coumarin from the PRC that are alleged to be sold at less than fair value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 26 and 27, 1994, responses to the survey were received from Tianjin No. 1 Perfumery Factory (Tianjin Perfumery)
and Shanghai Perfumery General Factory (Shanghai Perfumery), both of whom manufacture coumarin. These responses
helped us identify other producers and exporters of coumarin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 28, 1994, MOFTEC and those PRC producers and exporters identified in the course of this proceeding, for
which we had addresses, were sent full questionnaires. Additionally, during the month of March, the Department held
a questionnaire presentation with MOFTEC and company officials in Beijing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a March 28, 1994, filing, MOFTEC advised the Department that the following companies produced or exported the subject
merchandise to the U.S. during the POI: Tianjin Perfumery, Shanghai Perfumery, Gaoyo Perfumery Factory (Gaoyo Perfumery),
Changzhou No. 2 Chemical Plant (Changzhou Chemical) (producers); China Foreign Trade Development Companies (CFTD),
Tianjin Chemicals Import &amp; Export (Tianjin Chemicals), Tianjin Native Produce Import &amp; Export Corporation
(Tianjin Native), Jiangsu Native Produce Import &amp; Export (Jiangsu Native), and China Tuhsu Flavors and Fragrances
Import and Export Corporation (China Tuhsu) (exporters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March and April, 1994, responses to section A of our questionnaire were received from the following producers and
exporters: Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD, Tianjin Chemicals and Gaoyo Perfumery, Tianjin Perfumery and Tianjin Native,
and Jiangsu Native and Changzhou Chemical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 13, 1994, pursuant to section 353.15(c) of the Department's regulations, we postponed the preliminary determination
in this investigation (see, 59 FR 19692, April 25, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In April 1994, we received responses to section C of our questionnaire from Tianjin Chemicals, Tianjin Native, CFTD,
and Jiangsu Native; and responses to section D of our questionnaire from Gaoyo Perfumery, Tianjin Perfumery, Shanghai
Perfumery, and Changzhou Chemical. China Tuhsu did not respond to any portion of our questionnaire.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 28, 1994, counsel for Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD submitted public information concerning surrogate values
for factors of production for coumarin. On May 20, 1994, petitioners provided the Department with Indian prices for
certain factors used in the production of coumarin, and on July 15, 1994, counsel for the remaining participating
respondents submitted information regarding surrogate values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 13 and 19, 1994, the Department issued supplemental questionnaires to all producers and exporters in the investigation
except China Tuhsu. On June 9, 1994, counsel for Shanghai Perfumery and CFTD advised the Department that it was withdrawing
its representation of the companies. On May 27 and June 9, we received responses to our supplemental questionnaires
from all respondents except Shanghai Perfumery, CFTD, and China Tuhsu. On June 23, 1994, Changzhou Chemical submitted
minor revisions to its factors of production data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 27, 1994, the Department issued a questionnaire to all respondents except China Tuhsu regarding the issue of
separate rates. Responses were received from Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Native, and Tianjin Chemical on June 13, 1994
(see, ``Separate Rates'' section below).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 20, 1994, petitioners, pursuant to section 353.16 of the Department's regulations, amended the petition
in this investigation to allege the existence of critical circumstances with respect to imports of coumarin from
the PRC. On June 22, 1994, the Department sent letters to Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native requesting
information on volume and value of shipments of the subject merchandise to the United States. We received their responses
on July 12, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 15, 1994, we sent supplemental ``Separate Rates'' questionnaires to Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals,
and Tianjin Native.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each requested a separate, company-specific rate. Their
respective business licenses each indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 22585, 22586, May 2, 1994)
(``Silicon Carbide''), and the Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the People's
Republic of China (59 FR 28053, May 31, 1994 (``Sebacic Acid''), ``ownership of a company by all the people does not
require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these three respondents are eligible for consideration
for separate rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To establish whether a firm is sufficiently independent to be entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes
each exporting entity under a test arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers
from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991) (``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under
the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence
of both

1. Absence of De Jure Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The respondents in this investigation have submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control, including three enactments indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises ``owned by all
of the people'' is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's
Republic of China on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law'');
``Regulations for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved
on August 23, 1992 (``1992 Regulations''); and the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration of Export Commodities,''
approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law
provides that enterprises owned ``by the whole people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible
for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers, and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988
Law also has other provisions which support a finding that enterprises have management independence from the government.
The 1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make
their own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits
(Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions
(Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire their employees without government approval
(Article XVII). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Export Provisions list those products subject to direct government control. Coumarin is not included in the Export
Provisions list and does not, therefore, appear to be subject to the export constraints of these provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of these enactments indicates that Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native are not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
subject to governmental control. However, there is some evidence that the provisions of the above-cited laws and
regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC
Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information Service-China-93&hyph;133 (July
14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that an analysis of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control is critical to determining whether respondents are, in fact, subject to governmental control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Absence of De Facto Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether each respondent is subject to de facto governmental
control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by or subject to the approval of a governmental
authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements; (3) whether
the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management; and (4)
whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding disposition
of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide and Sebacic Acid). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have each asserted that (1) it establishes its own export prices;
(2) it negotiates contracts without guidance from any governmental entities or organizations; (3) its management
operates with a high degree of autonomy and there is no information on the record that suggests central government
control over selection of management; and (4) it retains the proceeds of its export sales, and has the authority to
sell its assets and to obtain loans. In addition, questionnaire responses indicate that company-specific pricing
during the POI does not suggest any coordination among exporters (

there is a

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
absence of governmental control of export functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have preliminarily met the criteria for the
application of separate rates. We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire
responses are supported by verifiable documentation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two additional issues relating to governmental control that we will consider further for purposes of our
final determination. First, Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and Tianjin Native have indicated that the appointments
of their general managers are subject to approval by the local Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Bureaus (local
Bureaus). Second, each of the responding exporters has reported that they are ``administratively subject to'' the
local Bureaus. While the significance of the involvement of the local Bureaus is unclear, the respondents have reported
that the local bureaus do not control the key functions of the enterprises. However, we will examine at verification
the precise nature of the authority that the local Bureaus exercise over the enterprises.

Nonmarket Economy Country Status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PRC has been treated as a nonmarket economy country (NME) in all past antidumping investigations (see, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Sebacic Acid and Silicon Carbide). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn
our former determinations. Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as
an NME for purposes of this investigation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the Department is investigating imports from an NME, section 773(c)(1) of the Act directs us to base FMV on the
NME producers' factors of production, valued in a comparable market economy that is a significant producer of the
merchandise. Section 773(c)(2) of the Act alternatively provides that where available information is inadequate
for using the factors of production methodology, FMV may be based on the export prices for comparable merchandise
from market economy countries at a comparable level of economic development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have relied on the methodology provided by section 773(c)(1) of
the Act to determine FMV. The sources of individual factor prices are discussed under the FMV section, below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent
possible, in one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that
of the NME country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that
India is the country most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development (see Memorandum from David
Mueller, Director Office of Policy, to Gary Taverman, Director of Division I of Office of Antidumping Investigations,
dated March 10, 1994). In addition, there is evidence on the record that coumarin is produced in India.

Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of coumarin from the PRC to the United States by Jiangsu Native, Tianjin Chemicals, and
Tianjin Native were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value
(FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
directly by the Chinese exporters to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire and were found to be eligible for a separate
rate, we calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United
States. As necessary, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, containerization, loading, port handling
expenses, foreign inland and marine insurance, valued in a surrogate country. We were unable to obtain surrogate
value information for ocean freight, so we valued ocean freight on international shipping rates between the PRC and
U.S. ports, as quoted by a market-economy shipping company. (For a complete analysis of USP deductions, see the Calculation
Memorandum for this investigation).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories
in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the three exporters. The factors used to produce coumarin include
materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate
values from India and Indonesia for the different inputs. We made adjustments to materials costs for the recovery
of by-products, where applicable. In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production,
we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information (public information). For a complete
analysis of surrogate values, see the Calculation Memorandum for this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the
coumarin factories, and between factories and exporters/ports. In those cases where a respondent failed to provide
any information on transportation distances, we applied, as best information available, the farthest distance
reported for the input in the public version of questionnaire responses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value certain raw materials, we used public information from Chemical Business of India for July&hyph;October
1993, and India Chemical Weekly for July&hyph;November 1993. For raw materials not listed in Chemical Business of
India, or India Chemical Weekly, we used the Monthly Trade Statistics of Foreign Trade of India, Volume II_Imports
(Indian Import Statistics) for April 1992&hyph;March 1993. We adjusted the factor values to the POI using wholesale
price indices published in International Financial Statistics (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
IFS
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) by the International Monetary Fund. For materials sourced from market-economy countries and purchased in convertible
currencies, we applied the actual purchase price paid during the POI, or the time period closest to the POI. No product-specific
public information pertaining to India or any other potential surrogate country was available for certain raw materials.
With respect to these raw materials, we have used, privately researched Indian price quotes, Indian import statistics
for categories that include the specific raw materials (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``basket'' categories), or Indonesian import statistics. (For a complete analysis of raw material valuations,
see the Calculation Memorandum for this investigation).

To value electricity, we used public information from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region
(January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. We selected this source because it provides an electricity
rate for industrial use during the POI from India, our preferred surrogate country. To value water, we have used public
information for India from the Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (November 1993) which is
also published by the Asian Development Bank. To value coal, we used Indian Import Statistics. We adjusted the factor
values to the POI using wholesale price indices published in the IFS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value hourly labor rates in India, we used the International Labor Office's 1993 Yearbook of Labor Statistics and
Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on relevant data from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin
(RBI), December 1993. We based our overhead percentage calculations on the RBI summary income statement data applicable
to the chemical manufacturing industry, and adjusted to reflect an energy-exclusive overhead percentage. For selling,
general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, we calculated percentages based on the RBI summary income statement
data. We used the calculated SG&amp;A percentages because they were greater than the ten percent statutory minimum.
For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and SG&amp;A expenses,
because the RBI percentage was less than eight percent. We added packing based on Indian values obtained from Indian
Import Statistics.

Best Information Available (BIA)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because information has not been presented to the Department to prove otherwise, any PRC company that did not respond
fully to the Department's questionnaires or otherwise did not participate in this investigation, are assumed to
be under government control, and, therefore, are not entitled to separate dumping margins. In the absence of responses
from those companies that did not fully respond to the Department's questionnaire, and other PRC exporters during
the POI, we are basing the All Other rate on BIA, pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act (see Silicon Carbide). In determining
what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower
margins to those respondents that cooperated in an investigation and more adverse margins for those respondents
which did not cooperate in an investigation. When a company refuses to provide the information requested in the form
required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department
to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated
rate of any respondent in the investigation (see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled
Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel
Plate From Belgium (58 FR 37083, July 9, 1993). In this investigation, since some PRC exporters failed to respond to
our questionnaire, we are assigning to them the highest margin based on information submitted in the petition (see
Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Coumarin from the People's Republic of China, 59 FR 3841, January
27, 1994). This rate applies to all exporters other than those responding exporters that are receiving separate rates.

Critical Circumstances

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners allege that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of coumarin from the PRC. Section
733(e)(1) of the Act provides that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that critical circumstances exist
if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of investigation at less than its fair value, and

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding criterion (A) above, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more (in purchase price situations)
as sufficient to impute knowledge of dumping (see Silicon Carbide). Since the preliminary estimated dumping margins
for exporters of coumarin in the PRC are in excess of 25 percent, we can impute knowledge of dumping to the importers
of the subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding criterion (B) above, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(f), we generally consider the following factors in determining
whether imports have been massive over a short period of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal
trends (if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted for by the imports. If imports during
the period immediately following the petition increase by 15 percent over imports during a comparable period immediately
preceding the filing of a petition, we consider them massive pursuant to section 353.16(f)(2) of the Department's
regulations. Three respondents have responded to the Department's request for the quantity and value of monthly
exports to the U.S. To determine whether there have been massive imports of coumarin from the PRC, we compared each
respondent's volume of shipments for the period following the petition (January through June 1994) to the period
immediately preceding the petition (July through December 1993). Based on an analysis of these export data, we find
that imports from Tianjin Chemical and Tianjin Native have been massive, while imports from Jiangsu Native have not
been massive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to share of domestic consumption, the information available to us at this time does not allow us to evaluate
whether the increase in absolute volume of coumarin shipments can be accounted for by a change in domestic consumption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Tianjin Chemical and Tianjin Native, because the preliminary dumping margins are sufficient to impute knowledge
of dumping, and because we have found that imports of coumarin have been massive, we preliminarily determine that
critical circumstances do exist for these two exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Jiangsu Native, because we have found that imports of coumarin have not been massive, we preliminarily
determine that critical circumstances do not exist for this exporter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As regards the firms covered by the ``All Others'' rate, we have used BIA as the basis for determining whether critical
circumstances exist for non-respondent exporters. The BIA margin exceeds the 25 percent threshold for imputing
a knowledge of dumping to the importers of the merchandise. In addition, we have adversely assumed, as BIA, a massive
increase in imports from these non-respondent exporters. We, therefore, determine that critical circumstances
also exist for these exporters.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (the Department) preliminarily determines that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Brazil
is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''
section of this notice.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by the scope of this investigation is SSB. For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless
steel bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned,
cold-drawn, cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their
whole length in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons,
octagons or other convex polygons. SSB includes cold-finished SSBs that are turned or ground in straight lengths,
whether produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations,
ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled
products (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness,
or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice the thickness), wire
(i.e., cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross sections along their whole length, which do not conform
to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSB subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheading 7222.10.0005, 7222.10.0050,
7222.20.0005, 7222.20.0045, 7222.20.0075 and 7222.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 11, 1994, the U.S. Embassy in Brazil provided the Department with volume and value statistics for Brazilian
SSB producing firms. On February 14, 1994, Instituto Brasileiro de Siderugica, the association for the iron and steel
industry in Brazil, submitted volume and value data on behalf of its members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 28, 1994, the Department sent its antidumping questionnaire to Acos Villares, S.A. (Villares). This
company accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the
POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). On March 1, 1994, the Department received a letter from Villares stating
that it would not participate in this investigation. No questionnaire responses were submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes
one class or kind of merchandise. (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) and (d).

Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because Villares failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we based our determination on BIA pursuant
to section 776(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As BIA, we are assigning 19.43 percent, the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance
with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who
refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review (56 FR 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has
been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit (

In accordance with section 733(d)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(1)) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service
to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Brazil, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this

the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

Scope of Investigation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this investigation is stainless steel bar (SSB). For purposes of this investigation,
the term ``stainless steel bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled,
forged, turned, cold-drawn, cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section
along their whole length in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles,
hexagons, octagons or other convex polygons. SSB includes cold-finished SSBs that are turned or ground in straight
lengths, whether produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that
have indentations, ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled
products (i.e., cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10
times the thickness, or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice
the thickness), wire (i.e., cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along their whole length,
which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSB subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheading 7222.10.0005, 7222.10.0050,
7222.20.0005, 7222.20.0045, 7222.20.0075 and 7222.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 25, 1994 we named Grand Foundry, Limited (Grand Foundry) and Mukand, Limited (Mukand) as respondents
in this investigation, and on February 28, 1994, we issued antidumping questionnaires to these companies. These
companies accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the
POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 26, 1994, Isibars, Limited (Isibars), an Indian producer/exporter of subject merchandise which was
not selected as a mandatory respondent, requested that it be allowed to participate in the investigation as a voluntary
respondent. On March 9, 1994, we sent Isibars a brief questionnaire requesting sales volume and value data and noted
that based upon Isibars response we would determine if it was appropriate to issue a complete questionnaire to the
company. On March 14, 1994, Isibars submitted its response to this questionnaire. Subsequently, on March 15, the
Department issued Isibars a questionnaire, noting its policy with respect to voluntary respondents. On March 28,
1994, Isibars requested via facsimile a 30-day extension in order to respond to the Department's questionnaire.
On March 28, 1994, we granted Isibars a partial extension contingent upon receipt of an officially filed extension
request. However, because Isibars never submitted such an extension request or a response to any section of our questionnaire,
we never deemed it to be a mandatory respondent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 4, 1994, Akai Impex Ltd. (Akai), another Indian producer/exporter of subject merchandise, requested that
it be allowed to participate in the investigation. Subsequently, on March 7, 1994, we sent Akai a brief questionnaire
requesting sales volume and value data and noted that based upon Akai's response we would determine if it was appropriate
to issue it a questionnaire. Akai's response to this questionnaire was received on March 14, 1994. Our examination
of this response revealed that Akai had not made sales of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI,
and on this basis, we denied its request for voluntary respondent status on March 17, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 23, 1994, we received a response to Section A of the Department's questionnaire from Grand Foundry. In that
response, respondent reported that it made no sales of export-quality merchandise in the home market during the POI.
On April 4, 1994, we received petitioners' comments on Grand Foundry's Section A response. On April 5, 1994, the Department
determined that Grand Foundry's third country sales to Germany were the appropriate basis for foreign market value
(FMV), pursuant to 19 C.F.R. 353.49. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments
on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994,
Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 22, 1994, we received a response to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire from Grand Foundry.
On May 4, 1994, we received petitioners' comments regarding Grand Foundry's responses to Sections B and C. On May 10,
1994, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to Grand Foundry. Grand Foundry submitted its supplemental response
on June 20, 1994. Mukand never responded to any section of our antidumping questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994 the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination until
July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.15(c) and (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 25, 1994, petitioners alleged that Grand Foundry sold the subject merchandise in Germany at prices below its
cost of production (COP). Respondent rebutted the allegation on June 2, 1994. Petitioners supplemented their original
allegation on June 7, 1994. On June 15, 1994, we determined that petitioners' allegation provided a reasonable basis
to believe or suspect below cost sales, pursuant to section 353.51(a) of the Department's regulations. Accordingly,
we initiated a sales below cost investigation for Grand Foundry on June 15, 1994, and subsequently issued Section
D of the Department's questionnaire on June 16. On July 8, 1994, Grand Foundry requested an extension of time until
August 1, 1994, to respond to Section D of the questionnaire. The Department granted such an extension on July 12, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on July 12, Grand Foundry requested that the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after
the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination, if that determination is affirmative.

In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have determined that the use of best information available (BIA) is
appropriate for Mukand. Mukand did not respond to the Department's questionnaire issued on February 28, 1994. Because
Mukand failed to answer the Department's questionnaire, we find it has not cooperated in this investigation.

Such or Similar Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology,
we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the third country
market to compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix
V to the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other
SSB grades which respondent sold in the third country market during the POI, but which were not taken into account in
Appendix V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February
28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of
our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Acciaierie Valbruna (Valbruna),
a respondent in the concurrent antidumping investigation of SSB from Italy requested that the Department reconsider
the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, Valbruna argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs
as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP
and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna,
we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Although the issue was
not raised by any interested party in the instant investigation, we reversed the order of these criteria to ensure
consistent treatment of respondents in performing product comparisons across all concurrent SSB investigations.

Fair Value Comparisons

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, we are using BIA with regard to Mukand and thus did not make fair value comparisons with regard to
this company. For the remaining company, Grand Foundry, we made fair value comparisons as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine whether sales of SSB from Grand Foundry to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (``USP'') to the FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value''
sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 C.F.R. 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where
possible.

United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise
was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States before importation and because exporter's sales price methodology
was not otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated PP based on packed CNF prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the
Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage (including containerization, foreign inland
freight and port charges) and ocean freight.

In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with
section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that Grand Foundry had a viable home market
with respect to sales of SSB during the POI. However, based on Grand Foundry's claim that its home market sales made
during the POI consisted only of SSB scrap and rejects and that its U.S. sales during the same period consisted only
of first (or export) quality SSB, we determined that third country sales would be a more appropriate basis for FMV.
(See April 5, 1994 Decision Memorandum To Richard W. Moreland From The Team Re: Appropriate Basis for FMV.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to select the appropriate third country in this case, we examined three factors in accordance with 19 C.F.R.
353.49(b): (1) The degree of similarity in terms of physical characteristics between the products sold in the United
States and the individual third country markets; (2) the volume of sales in each third country market relative to that
in the United States; and (3) the similarity of the market organization and development between the U.S. market and
third country market. Based on these factors, we selected sales to Germany as the appropriate basis on which to calculate
FMV.

 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we will adjust for those expenses under the
circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2),
as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under
the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market foreign brokerage
(including containerization, foreign inland freight, loading and port fees), ocean freight, and marine insurance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made further circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate, for differences
in credit expenses, and bank charges (including bank interest, courier charges and commissions) between the U.S.
and third country markets. We recalculated credit expenses to reflect the revised short-term interest rate reported
by respondent. We deducted third country commissions and added U.S. indirect selling expenses capped by the amount
of third country commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also deducted third country packing and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.
We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in
accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.

to determine whether Grand Foundry made third country sales of subject merchandise at prices below its COP, and over
an extended period of time. Although Grand Foundry's COP questionnaire response will be received too late for consideration
for the preliminary determination, it will be verified and considered for the final determination.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (the Department) preliminarily determines that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Italy
is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of
this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this investigation is SSB. For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless steel
bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned, cold-drawn,
cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their whole length
in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons, octagons
or other convex polygons. SSB includes cold-finished SSBs that are turned or ground in straight lengths, whether
produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations,
ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled
products (i.e., cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10
times the thickness, or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice
the thickness), wire (i.e., cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along their whole length,
which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSB subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.10.0005, 7222.10.0050,
7222.20.0005, 7222.20.0045, 7222.20.0075 and 7222.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 26, 1994), the following events have occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 28, 1994, we named Acciaierie Valbruna S.r.l. (Valbruna) and Foroni S.p.A. (Foroni) as respondents in
this investigation and issued antidumping questionnaires to both companies. These companies accounted for at least
60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b).
We presented the questionnaire to Valbruna at its facility in Vicenza, Italy, on March 3, 1994, and to Foroni at its
facility in Gorle Minore, Italy, on March 7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received responses to Section A of the Department's questionnaire on March 21, 1994, from Foroni and on March 22,
1994 from Valbruna. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we received rebuttal comments
on this issue. On May 11, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes one class or kind of merchandise. (See May 11, 1994,
Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1994, we sent Sections A through D of the Department's questionnaire to Cogne S.p.A. (Cogne) because it
requested that it be included in the investigation as a voluntary respondent. On April 14, 1994, Cogne notified the
Department that it had decided not to participate as a voluntary respondent in the investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) and (d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 29 and May 2, 1994, we received responses to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire from Foroni
and Valbruna, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 18, 1994, petitioners alleged that Valbruna sold the subject merchandise in Italy at prices below its cost of
production (COP). Petitioners supplemented their original allegation on June 3, 13, and 22, 1994. Respondent rebutted
the allegation on May 24, June 9, 15, 27, and 28, 1994. On June 24, 1994, we determined that petitioners' allegation
provided a reasonable basis to believe or suspect below cost sales, pursuant to section 353.51(a) of the Department's
regulations. Accordingly, we initiated a sales below cost investigation for Valbruna on June 24, and issued Section
D of the Department's questionnaire on the same date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 20, 1994, we issued a supplemental questionnaire to both respondents. Valbruna submitted its supplemental
response on June 6, 1994, and Foroni on June 8, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 19, 1994, Valbruna requested an extension of time until August 5, 1994, to respond to the Section D questionnaire.
The Department granted such an extension on July 20, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, on July 20, 1994, respondent Valbruna requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone the final determination until 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination
in the

Such or Similar Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology,
we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to
compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to
the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other
SSB grades which Foroni sold during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February
28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of
our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Valbruna requested that
the Department reconsider the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, it argued that the distinguishing
factor of SSBs as compared to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and
that the COP and price of SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised
by Valbruna, we reversed the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of SSB from Italy to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United
States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade,
where possible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of Foroni's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore,
we based USP on exporter's sales prices (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. In accordance with section
772(d) of the Act, we calculated ESP based on FOB warehouse and FOB port prices to unrelated customers in the United
States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign brokerage, ocean freight (including foreign inland
freight and loading/unloading charges), U.S. brokerage and handling, U.S. inland freight, U.S. import duties,
and export taxes. For those sales of subject merchandise with FOB U.S. port sales terms, we made no deduction for the
U.S. inland freight charges reported in respondent's U.S. sales listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also deducted credit expenses, warranty expenses, product liability premiums, quality control expenses, and
commissions paid to an employee, in accordance with section 772(e)(2) of the Act. We also deducted U.S. indirect selling
expenses, including pre-sale warehousing costs incurred in the United States, advertising, and inventory carrying
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not make an adjustment for payroll taxes reported by Foroni for the preliminary determination because Foroni
did not provide sufficient explanation as to how these expenses should be treated. We will review these expenses at
verification and reconsider the issue for the final determination. In addition, we made no adjustment for U.S. packing
expenses because Foroni claims that it does not pack the subject merchandise and, therefore, did not report this expense.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Valbruna 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Valbruna, we based USP on both ESP and purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772 of the Act, because Valbruna
made sales both before and after importation into the United States. We calculated both PP and ESP based on packed prices
to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of the Act, for both PP and ESP sales we made deductions,
where appropriate, for ocean freight (including foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, marine insurance
and foreign brokerage and handling), U.S. import duties, U.S. merchandise processing and harbor maintenance fees,
U.S. inland freight, U.S. brokerage and handling, and containerization expenses (including drayage, stripping,
and storage expenses). We added freight income (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 freight charges paid by the customer but not included in the gross price) to both ESP and PP sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For ESP sales only, we further deducted credit expenses and warranty expenses, in accordance with section 772(e)(2)
of the Act. We also deducted indirect selling expenses incurred in Italy on sales to the United States, as well as indirect
selling expenses incurred in the United States, and inventory carrying costs. We recalculated indirect selling
expenses incurred in the United States to reflect respondent's reported methodology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also made an adjustment to USP for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sales in Italy in accordance with
our practice, pursuant to the Court of International Trade (CIT) decision in

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with
section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that both respondents had viable home markets
with respect to sales of SSB during the POI.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated FMV based on ex-factory prices charged to unrelated customers in the home market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we deducted credit expenses and quality control expenses. We also deducted home
market indirect selling expenses capped by the sum of U.S. commissions and indirect selling expenses (including
inventory carrying costs), in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in
accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We did not make an adjustment for VAT for Foroni based on its claim that it and its home market customers qualify for exemptions
under the Italian VAT program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also made no adjustment for home market packing expenses because Foroni claims that it does not pack the subject
merchandise and, therefore, did not report this expense.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated FMV based on packed prices charged to related and unrelated customers in the home market. For purposes
of the preliminary determination, we included arm's-length sales to related customers, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.45.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deducted cash discounts. We added freight income (i.e., freight charges paid by the customer but not included in
the gross price) to both ESP and PP sales.

, 13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we will adjust for those expenses under the
circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2),
as appropriate. Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from FMV under
the circumstance-of-sale provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight (including
inland insurance). We adjusted for pre-sale warehousing charges associated with pre-sale movement charges in the
ESP offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For comparison to ESP sales, we also deducted credit expenses and home market commissions from FMV. We then deducted
home market indirect selling expenses capped by the sum of U.S. indirect selling expenses and inventory carrying
costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For comparison to PP sales, we made a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for differences in credit expenses and warranty
expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We also deducted home market commissions from FMV and added to FMV the U.S.
indirect selling expenses capped by the amount of home market commissions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we considered pre-sale warehousing expenses to be indirect selling
expenses because respondent has not adequately demonstrated that such expenses are directly attributable to particular
sales of the subject merchandise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also did not allow Valbruna's claim of imputed VAT expenses. While there may be an opportunity cost or income associated
with the payment of VAT, that fact alone is not a sufficient basis for the Department to make an adjustment. (See Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfur Dyes, Including Sulfur Vat Dyes, from the United Kingdom, 58
FR 3253, January 8, 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both ESP and PP sales, we deducted home market packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section
773(a)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made adjustments, where appropriate, for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, in
accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We adjusted for VAT in accordance with our practice. (See the ``United States Price'' section of this notice, above.)

Petitioners alleged that Valbruna made home market sales of subject merchandise at prices below its COP. Based on
petitioners' allegation, and in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we initiated a COP investigation to determine
whether Valbruna made home market sales at prices below its COP over an extended period of time. Although Valbruna's
COP questionnaire response will be received too late to be considered for the preliminary determination, it will
be verified and considered for the final determination.

Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Commerce (the Department) preliminarily determines that stainless steel bar (SSB) from Japan
is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff
Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''
section of this notice.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this investigation is SSB. For purposes of this investigation, the term ``stainless steel
bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned, cold-drawn,
cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their whole length
in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons, octagons
or other convex polygons. SSB includes cold-finished SSBs that are turned or ground in straight lengths, whether
produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations,
ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled
products (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness,
or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice the thickness), wire
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross sections along their whole length, which do not conform
to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSB subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheading 7222.10.0005, 7222.10.0050,
7222.20.0005, 7222.20.0045, 7222.20.0075, and 7222.30.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The period of investigation (POI) is July 1, 1993, through December 31, 1993.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the notice of initiation on January 19, 1994 (59 FR 3844, January 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 4, 1994, the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo provided the Department with the names of the firms producing SSB in Japan.
To supplement this data, on February 7, 1994, counsel for respondents submitted volume and value statistics for eight
Japanese companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 14, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination
(USITC Publication 2734, February 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 28, 1994, the Department sent its antidumping questionnaire to Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. (Aichi), Daido
Steel Co., Ltd. (Daido), and Sanyo Special Steel Co., Ltd. (Sanyo). These firms accounted for at least 60 percent of
the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the POI, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b). On
March 7, 1994, the Department met with company officials from Aichi, Daido and Sanyo at the Japanese Ministry of International
Trade and Industry in Tokyo. At this meeting each of the three named respondent companies stated that they did not intend
to participate in our investigation. No questionnaire responses were submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 11, 1994, the Department received a request from an additional Japanese producer of SSB, Abe Bright Shaft
Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (Abe Bright), to be a voluntary respondent in this investigation. On March 11, 1994, we sent
a questionnaire to Abe Bright. On April 4, 1994, Abe Bright submitted a letter withdrawing its request to participate
as a voluntary respondent in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 25, 1994, we received comments on the issue of class or kind of merchandise from interested parties, per the
Department's invitation for such comments in its notice of initiation. On April 13, 1994, we determined that SSB constitutes
one class or kind of merchandise. (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 May 11, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from The Team Re: Class or Kind of Merchandise.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination
until July 28, 1994. On May 16, 1994, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 25447), a notice announcing the postponement of the preliminary determination until not later than July 28,
1994, pursuant to petitioners' request, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15 (c) and (d).

Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the three named respondents failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we based our determination
on BIA pursuant to section 776(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As BIA, we are assigning 61.47 percent, the highest margin among the margins alleged in the petition, in accordance
with the two-tiered BIA methodology under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon a respondent who
refuses to cooperate or otherwise significantly impedes the proceeding, and as outlined in the Antifriction Bearings
(Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof From the Federal Republic of Germany; Final Results of Antidumping
Duty Administrative Review (56 Fr 31692, 31704, July 11, 1991). The Department's methodology for assigning BIA has
been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see

In accordance with section 733(d)(1) (19 U.S.C. 1673b(d)(1)) of the Act, we are directing the U.S. Customs Service
to suspend liquidation of all entries of SSB from Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this
notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice in the

the foreign market value of the subject merchandise exceeds the United States price as shown below. The suspension
of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice.

On February 25, 1994, we named Roldan, S.A. (Roldan) and Acenor, S.A. (Acenor) as respondents in this investigation
and on February 28, 1994, issued antidumping questionnaires to both companies. These companies represent 100 percent
of U.S. imports of subject merchandise from Spain during the POI. We presented the questionnaire to Roldan at its facility
in Madrid, Spain on March 7, 1994, and to Acenor at its facility in Bilbao, Spain on March 10, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We received Roldan's response to Section A of the Department's questionnaire on March 28, 1994. We received Roldan's
responses to Sections B and C of the Department's questionnaire on April 21, 1994. We received Acenor's responses
to Sections A, B, and C of the Department's questionnaire on May 18, 1994.

On May 27, 1994, the Department rescinded the COP investigations against Roldan and Acenor that were initiated on
January 19, 1994, because the Department had reason to believe that petitioners did not base their cost allegations
on information reasonably available to them. (See May 27, 1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara Stafford from David
L. Binder Re: Rescinding the COP investigations for Acenor and Roldan.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 13, 1994, the Department re-initiated COP investigations against Roldan and Acenor based on the allegations
submitted by petitioners on May 9, 1994, and May 24, 1994, pursuant to section 19 CFR 353.51(a) (1994). (See June 13,
1994, Decision Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Richard Moreland Re: Petitioners' Allegations of Sales Below
the Cost of Production for Roldan and Acenor.) We received Roldan's and Acenor's responses, to Section D of the Department's
questionnaire on June 23, and June 27, 1994, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

On April 26, 1994, the Department received a request from petitioners to postpone the preliminary determination

On July 13, 1994, the Department issued to each respondent a supplementary questionnaire regarding Section D of the
Department's original questionnaire. The due dates for Acenor's and Roldan's supplementary responses have been
extended until August 3 and August 4, 1994, respectively. Consequently, this information will be received too late
for purposes of the preliminary determination, but will be analyzed, verified, and considered for the final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 26, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondents requested that the Department postpone the final determination
until 135 days after the date of publication of the Department's preliminary determination, if that determination
is affirmative.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that all the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar
merchandise. We made fair value comparisons on this basis. In accordance with the Department's standard methodology,
we first compared identical merchandise. Where there were no sales of identical merchandise in the home market to
compare to U.S. sales, we made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of the criteria defined in Appendix V to
the antidumping questionnaire, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We altered the order of the SSB grades specified within the grade criterion of Appendix V to account for certain other
SSB grades which Roldan sold during the POI, but which were not taken into account in Appendix V. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also reversed the order of the size and shape criteria in Appendix V. In our original questionnaire issued on February
28, 1994, the fifth and sixth matching criteria were shape and size, respectively. However, based on the advice of
our in-house technical expert, we reversed the order of these two criteria. Subsequently, Acciaierie Valbruna (Valbruna),
a respondent in the concurrent antidumping investigation of SSB from Italy, requested that the Department reconsider
the reversal of these criteria in Appendix V. Specifically, it argued that the distinguishing factor of SSBs as compared
to all other stainless steel products is that they can be supplied in a variety of shapes and that the COP and price of
SSBs are influenced significantly more by shape than size. In light of the arguments raised by Valbruna, we reversed
the hierarchy of these criteria to reflect the order in our original Appendix V. Although the issue was not raised by
any interested party in the instant investigation, we reversed the order of these criteria to ensure consistent treatment
of respondents in performing product comparisons across all concurrent SSB investigations.

On April 21, 1994, Roldan reported sales made to both related and unrelated distributors, and unrelated end users
in the home market. We compared related party prices to unrelated party prices using the test set forth in Appendix
II to Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Certain Cold-rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products from Argentina,
58 FR 37062 (July 9, 1994), and determined that the sales made to related parties were not at arm's length. We subsequently
requested that Roldan and Acenor report all sales made by their related parties to the first unrelated customer in
the home market. These sales, reported on June 29, and July 1, for Acenor and Roldan, respectively, were submitted
too late to be properly analyzed for use in the preliminary determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 13, 1994, Roldan submitted a revised home market sales listing including Roldan's sales to both related and
unrelated parties. However, for the preliminary determination we did not use portions of the revised sales listing
containing related party sales because we found certain discrepancies between the related party sales data contained
in respondent's original and revised responses. However, we intend to clarify these discrepancies prior to verification
and consider respondent's revised related party sales listing for the final determination based on verification
findings. Therefore, for purposes of the preliminary determination, we only used the portion of Roldan's sales listing
pertaining to sales made directly to unrelated parties in our analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Acenor, we compared prices to a related party with prices to unrelated parties using the test referenced above
and determined that the sales made to the related party were not at arm's length. Accordingly, we used only sales made
directly to unrelated parties reported in Acenor's June 29, 1994, sales listing.

To determine whether sales of SSB from Spain to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United
States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade,
where possible.

For both Roldan and Acenor, we based USP on purchase price (PP), in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because
the subject merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers in the United States before importation and exporter's
sales price methodology was not otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We made an adjustment to USP for the value-added tax (VAT) paid on the comparison sales in Spain, in accordance with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We made no adjustment for freight charge differentials claimed by Roldan because of the lack of data on the record concerning

In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of SSB in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of SSB to the volume of third country sales of SSB in accordance with
section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. Based on this comparison, we determined that both respondents had viable home markets
with respect to sales of SSB during the POI.

Petitioners alleged that Roldan and Acenor were selling in the home market at prices below COP in the petition filed
in this investigation. The Department initiated COP investigations for both respondents on January, 19, 1994. However,
as stated above, the Department rescinded the original COP investigations. After reviewing petitioners' revised
allegations, we re-initiated COP investigations. We requested that respondents reply to Section D of our antidumping
questionnaires issued on February 28, 1994. Roldan and Acenor submitted their responses to Section D of our questionnaire
on June 23, and June 27, 1994, respectively. On July 13, 1994, the Department sent Roldan and Acenor a Section D deficiency
questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to determine whether home market prices were below COP within the meaning of section 773(b) of the Act, we calculated
COP based on the sum of the respondents' cost of materials, fabrication, general expenses and home market packing
costs. We compared individual home market prices with the COPs. We tested the home market prices on a product-specific
basis using Roldan's sales to unrelated customers from the database received on June 13, 1994, and Acenor's sales
to unrelated customers from the database received on June 29, 1994. We compared model-specific COP to reported prices
that were net of movement charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following our standard practice, where we found over 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices
above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost sales because we determined that the respondent's below-cost sales
were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were
at prices above the COP, we discarded only the below-cost sales if made over an extended period of time. Where we found
that more than 90 percent of a respondent's sales of a given product were at prices below the COP and were sold over an
extended period of time, we disregarded all sales for that model and calculated FMV based on constructed value (CV),
in accordance with section 773(b) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If sales below cost occurred in three or more months of the POI, they are considered to be made over an extended period
of time. For sales made in less than three months of the POI, the extended period of time is the number of months in which
the sales occur. (See, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roldan and Acenor provided no indication that the disregarded sales were at prices that would permit recovery of all
costs within a reasonable period of time and in the normal course of trade. (See, 19 U.S.C. 1677b(b)(2)).

In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act we: (1) Included the greater of respondents' reported
general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM, as appropriate and; (2) for profit, we used the
statutory minimum of eight percent of the sum of COM and general expenses.

13 F.3d 398 (Fed. Cir., 1994), the Department no longer can deduct home market movement charges from FMV pursuant to
its inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Instead, we adjust for those expenses under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a) and the exporter's sales price offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(2), as appropriate.
Accordingly, in the present case, we deducted post-sale home market movement charges from the FMV under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 353.56(a). This adjustment included home market inland freight (including inland insurance).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both price-to-price comparisons and comparisons to CV, we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate,
for differences in credit expenses, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2). We re-calculated home market and U.S. credit
expenses because Roldan reported an average interest rate for a seven-month period, rather than the six-month POI.
In addition, for those sales with missing shipment dates and payment dates, we calculated credit expenses based on
the average payment period for the respondent's sales reported with shipment and payment dates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We did not make a circumstance-of-sale adjustment for commissions claimed by Roldan that were paid to its parent company
for export sales services performed by the parent company's commercial department. We also did not adjust for commissions
paid by Roldan to the U.S. subsidiary of its parent company for marketing Roldan's products in the United States. We
consider these payments to be intra-company transfers not tied directly to sales of the subject merchandise. Furthermore,
we have no appropriate benchmark against which to test whether the commission arrangements between Roldan and its
related party commissionaires are at arm's length. (See Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value; Coated
Groundwood Paper from Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and the United Kingdom, 56 FR 56359, November 4, 1992.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Department may terminate a suspended investigation if the Secretary of Commerce concludes that it is no longer
of interest to interested parties. Accordingly, as required by 19 CFR &sect;355.25(d)(4) (1994), we are notifying
the public of our intent to terminate the suspended investigation on Certain Forged Steel Crankshafts from Brazil
for which the Department has not received a request to conduct an administrative review for over four consecutive
annual anniversary months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 19 CFR &sect;355.25(d)(4)(iii), if domestic interested parties do not object to the Department's
intent to terminate the suspended investigation pursuant to this notice, or interested parties (as defined in 19
CFR 355.2(i)) do not request an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity
to request administrative review, we shall conclude that the suspended investigation is no longer of interest to
interested parties and shall proceed with the termination.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In May 1994, the Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP), which was established by NIST to study issues
and recommend actions which the Federal Government can take to address the short- and long-term issues of interworking
and convergence of networking protocols, issued its final report. An interagency study group composed of nine Federal
government agency staff members, the Panel was appointed at the request of the Office of Management and Budget in collaboration
with the Federal Networking Council and the Federal Information Resources Policy Council.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Panel concluded that no single networking protocol suite meets the full range of government requirements for
data internetworking. The Panel recommended that Federal government agencies select standards based on their interoperability
needs, existing infrastructure, costs, marketplace products, and status as standards. In addition, the Panel made
other recommendations concerning Federal internetworking as a component of the National Information Infrastructure
(NII).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST has proposed changes to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 146&hyph;1, Government Open Systems
Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), and FIPS 179, Government Network Management Profile (GNMP), based on the recommendations
of the Panel concerning government use of open voluntary standards for network protocols.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST solicits the views of industry, the public, and State and local governments concerning the Panel's recommendations
on long-term issues related to internetworking. The Report of the Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel can
be obtained in any of the following ways:

 Issuance of Modification 4 to Scientific Research and Enhancement Permit 795 (P503A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=59 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 27, 1994, an application was filed by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game for Modification 4 to Permit 795 (P503A)
for a take of listed species as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the
NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permit 795 was issued on July 29, 1992, and subsequently modified three times, as authorized by the ESA. The permit
authorizes scientific research and enhancement activities involving listed Snake River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus
nerka) through December 31, 1997.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Modification 4 of this permit, IDFG will release approximately 500 more of the progeny of the listed Redfish Lake
1991 sockeye outmigrants (artificially spawned in 1993) into two net pens in Redfish Lake in 1994 only. Modification
3 of this permit authorizes the release of up to 9,000 of these fish in 1994. Also in 1994, IDFG will release approximately
450 more listed sockeye fingerlings (1993 brood progeny of Redfish Lake anadromous sockeye that returned in 1993)
into net pens in Redfish Lake. Modification 3 authorizes the release of up to 1,200 of these fish in 1994. All of the juveniles
will be released from the net pens into Redfish Lake in September-October, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also for Modification 4, IDFG will release additional progeny of the adult, listed, Snake River sockeye salmon that
returned to Redfish Lake in 1991. In 1994 only, approximately 4,000 listed, artificially propagated, juveniles
will be released directly into Redfish Lake as presmolts in November-December, 1994 and allowed to overwinter under
natural conditions in the lake. These releases were not considered for Modification 3 because the fish developed
quicker than IDFG anticipated and because the 1991 adults matured and spawned at unusual times. IDFG plans to culture
these fish to reach a target size consistent with the size of the juveniles authorized to be released from the net pens
in Redfish Lake.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that on July 27, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification 4
to Permit Number 795 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issuance of this modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied
for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is/are the subject of this permit;
(3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance
with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following
offices, by appointment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Douglas Ingoldsby of Nutritech, Inc., has petitioned the Commission for an exemption from the child-resistant packaging
requirements for dietary supplements containing iron, 16 CFR 1700.14(a)(13). The exemption would be for unflavored,
unsweetened powders. The petition contends that child-resistant packaging is not needed for this product because
a child would gag before ingesting a toxic amount. The Commission solicits written comments concerning the petition
from all interested parties.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has docketed correspondence from Douglas Ingoldsby of Nutritech, Inc., as a petition for an exemption
from the child-resistant packaging requirement for certain dietary supplements containing iron that is codified
at 16 CFR 1700(a)(13). That requirement applies to supplements containing ``an equivalent of 250 mg or more of elemental
iron, from any source, in a single package in concentrations of 0.025 percent or more on a weight to volume basis for
liquids and 0.05 percent or more on a weight-to-weight basis for nonliquids *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Mr. Ingoldsby
requests that the Commission exempt ``an unsweetened, unflavored, bland multi-vitamin, mineral, amino acid powder
that contains no colorings, flavoring agents, [or] sweeteners of any kind and is virtually unpalatable until mixed
with juice.'' Petitioner contends that child-resistant requirements for this product are unnecessary because,
until it is mixed with juice, it is so unpalatable that a child will gag before ingesting a toxic amount.

III. Allegations of the Staff
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. In 1988, S&amp;D imported approximately 698,000 ``Santa Bear'' stuffed toy animals from China. The toys are subject
to, but some failed to comply with, the Commission's Small Parts Regulation, 16 CFR part 1501, in that when tested by
the staff in 1990 under 16 CFR 1500.52, (a) one or more parts of some of the tested toys separated and (b) one or more of
the parts that separated from the tested toys fit completely within the test cylinder, as set forth in 16 CFR 1501.4.
Accordingly, some of the Santa Bears present a ``mechanical hazard'' within the meaning of section 2(s) of the FHSA,
15 U.S.C. 1261(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Most of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above were sold to the public by Raffoler, Ltd., a mail order business
that is owned by Jerry Williams and Stephen Brown and is located at the same address as S&amp;D.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are a ``hazardous substance'' pursuant to section 2(f)(1)(D)
of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1261(f)(1)(D). Some of the Santa Bears identified in paragraph 5 above are also a ``banned hazardous
substance'' pursuant to section 2(q)(1)(A) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1261(q)(1)(A); and 16 CFR 1500.18(a)(9).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. On November 7, 1990, the staff sent a certified letter to S&amp;D advising the firm that the Santa Bear contains small
parts and is considered to be a banned hazardous substance. Notice was provided that continued sale of the product
is prohibited by section 4 of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263, and is punishable by penalties described in section 5 of the Act,
15 U.S.C. &sect;1264. At this time, S&amp;D had an unsold inventory of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. On November 15, 1990, S&amp;D attempted to return its inventory of Santa Bears to the import agent from whom S&amp;D
had purchasedthe goods. On November 20, 1990, the import agent advised S&amp;D that it would not accept return of the
Santa Bears.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In or around early December 1990, an employee of S&amp;D asked a third party to attempt to find prospective purchasers
of the Santa Bears. The third party found a prospective purchaser and so advised the employee of S&amp;D. The sale of
the Santa Bears was consummated and S&amp;D received proceeds from the sale in the form of credit from the import agent
for goods previously purchased and for goods to be purchased in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. After receipt of the certified letter of November 7, 1990, from the staff, as described in paragraph 8 above, S&amp;D
knowingly caused the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of its remaining inventory
of approximately 110,000 Santa Bears, in violation of section 4(a) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1263(a), and for which a civil
penalty may be improved pursuant to section 5(c) of the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. 1264(c).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. S&amp;D denies the allegations of the staff set forth in paragraphs 5 through 11 above, including the allegations
that it has knowingly caused the introduction into commerce of the aforesaid banned hazardous toys and that it has
violated the FHSA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The selection, service and appointment of board members are covered by provisions of Section 302 of Public Law 99&hyph;662.
The substance of those provisions is as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Selection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Members are to be selected from the spectrum of commercial carriers and shippers using the inland and intracoastal
waterways, to represent geographical regions and to be representative of waterway commerce as determined by commodity
ton-mile statistics. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Service. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is required to meet at least semi-annually to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army
on waterways construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for commercial navigation improvements,
and report its recommendations annually to the Secretary and the Congress. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Appointment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The operation of the Board and appointment of its members are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public
Law 92&hyph;463 as amended) and Departmental implementing regulations. Members serve without compensation, but
their expenses due to Board activities are reimbursable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The considerations specified in Section 302 for the selection of the Board members, and certain terms used therein,
have been interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise clarified as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Carriers and Shippers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law uses the terms ``primary users and shippers.'' Primary users has been interpreted to mean the providers of
transportation services on inland waterways such as barge or towboat operators. Shippers has been interpreted to
mean the purchasers of such services for the movement of commodities they own or control. Individuals are appointed
to the Board, but the must be either a carrier or a shipper, or represent a firm that is a carrier or shipper. For that purposes
a trade or regional association is neither a shipper or primary user. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Geographical Representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The law specifies ``various'' regions. For the purpose of selecting Board members, the waterways subjected to fuel
taxes and described in Public Law 95&hyph;502, as amended, have been aggregated into six regions. These are: (1) the
Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries above the mouth of the Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River and its tributaries
below the mouth of the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway in Louisiana and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed
waterways east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways including the Tennessee-Tombigbee, plus the
Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette. The
intent is that each region shall be represented by at least one board member, with that representation determined
by the regional concentration of the individual's traffic on the waterways. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commodity Representation. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waterway commerce has been aggregated into six commodity categories based on ``inland'' ton-miles shown in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waterborne Commerce of the United States. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In rank order they are: (1) Farm and Food Products; (2) Coal and Coke; (3) Petroleum, Crude and Products; (4) Minerals,
Ores, and Products; (5) Chemicals and Allied Products; and (6) All other. A considerable in the selection of Board
members will be, that the commodities carried or shipped by those individuals or their firms will be reasonably representative
of the above commodity categories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reflecting preceding selection criteria, the present representation by Board members is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The five members whose terms expire December 31, 1994, include one shipper representative representing the Upper
Mississippi River region (Region 1) and farm and food products, ethanol and coal; one shipper representative representing
the Lower Mississippi River region (Region 2), and farm and food products; one carrier representative representing
the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas (Region 4), and petroleum and petroleum products; one carrier
representative representing the Ohio River region (Region 3), and coal and coke, minerals, and metals, petroleum
products, farm and food products and chemicals; and, one carrier representative representing the Columbia-Snake
River system and Upper Willamette (Region 6), and farm and food products, petroleum products, chemicals, containers,
and forest products. The members representing Regions 2, 3 and 6 are eligible for reappointment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i), it intends to issue on a noncompetitive basis a grant to Vanderbilt
University, Nashville, TN, to continue providing academic training and sufficient on-the-job training to interns
to enable them to function as professionals in environmental remediation and waste treatment resulting from the
decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The period of performance for the grant will be three
years. The estimated cost is $833,973. First year funding will be $150,000.

project scope: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Vanderbilt University's May 27, 1994 application is for continuation of effort begun on a previous grant. This internship
program provides six people a year with the proper academic training and sufficient on-the-job training to enable
them to function as professionals in environmental remediation and waste treatment resulting from the decontamination
and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. The grant, which supports the Student Assisted Remediation Program
in Environmental Management, plays a major role in meeting the objective of providing young, trained personnel to
enter the fields of environmental remediation and waste treatment. At the end of the first year of academic work, the
students are assigned for three months to a DOE-owned contractor-operated facility or to a DOE prime contractor to
gain first-hand experience in the field. To date, most of the graduating students have chosen to work in the areas for
which they have trained, thereby meeting the primary objective of the program. In view of the nation's environmental
consciousness related to cleanup of Department of Energy facilities, it is clear that the increase in the number of
skilled personnel trained in environmental remediation and waste treatment as a result of the Vanderbilt University
Internship Program will aid in strengthening the Department's position of assuring that contaminated site are properly
decontaminated and decomissioned in an efficient and timely manner. In order to maintain continuity of a long-range
program that began in 1984, eligibility for this award is restricted to Vanderbilt University.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has received an application for a license of the proposed Martin
Creek Hydroelectric Project, Project No. 10942&hyph;001. The Martin Creek Hydroelectric Project is located on
Martin Creek, about 7 miles east of Skykomish, Washington, in King County.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FERC staff intends to prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA) on this hydroelectric project in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the EA, we will consider both site-specific and cumulative environmental impacts of the project and reasonable
alternatives, and will include an economic, financial, and engineering analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EA will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EA will
be analyzed by the staff and considered in a final EA. The staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration by the Commission in reaching its final licensing decision.

Take notice that on July 22, 1994, NorAm Gas Transmission Company (NGT), formerly Arkla Energy Resources Company,
1600 Smith Street, Houston, Texas 77002, filed in Docket No. CP93&hyph;434&hyph;001 an amendment to its original
application seeking abandonment authority required for NGT to effect the sale and transfer to UtiliCorp United,
Inc. (UtiliCorp) of certain existing natural gas transmission lines, together with equipment and facilities pertinent
thereto, located in the State of Kansas and services provided by means therefore, all as more fully set forth in the
application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGT states that on June 7, 1993, it filed an application in this docket seeking permission and approval to abandon by
sale to UtiliCorp all NGT jurisdictional facilities located in the State of Kansas in order to implement the Acquisition
Agreement executed May 7, 1993. It is stated that under the Acquisition Agreement, NGT and NorAm agreed to sell and
transfer to UtiliCorp both those local distribution facilities located in Kansas and currently owned and operated
by NorAm's Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company (ALG) distribution division, as well as NGT's jurisdictional transmission
facilities. It is stated that the transferred facilities would then be operated by UtiliCorp's division, Peoples
Natural Gas (PNG), as distribution utility facilities, with PNG continuing to provide retail services to ALG's customer's
and offering transportation or other substitute services to NGT's current customers. In connection therewith,
NGT states that the proposed abandonment contemplated the agreement by NGT and PNG to enter into a Capacity Lease Agreement
affecting a portion of the facilities to be transferred pursuant to which NGT would continue to provide services to
the City of Winfield, Kansas for the remainder of the term of the then current service agreement between NGT and Winfield.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is stated that Winfield protested the application and requested a hearing, raising concerns with respect to continuation
of the jurisdictional service to Winfield following the expiration of the Capacity Lease and as to the jurisdictional
status of the arrangement. NGT states that it and PNG have engaged in discussions to resolve Winfield's concerns and
those presented by the Commission staff at the May 19, 1994, technical conference convened in this proceeding. It
is stated that those negotiations have resulted in the agreement in principle of NGT, NorAm and UtiliCorp to amend
the Acquisition Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGT states that the primary purpose of the amendment will be to delete certain facilities from the list of facilities
to be conveyed to UtiliCorp and to delete the Capacity Lease from the arrangement. It is stated that the deleted facilities,
which are more particularly described in the amended application, will be retained by NGT, allowing it to continue
to provide direct transportation service to the City of Winfield, Kansas.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on July 21, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), 5400 Westheimer Court,
Houston, Texas 77056&hyph;5310, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;6&hyph;001 an amendment (Amendment) to its original
application filed in the captioned proceeding on October 1, 1993, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act for
a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the installation of incremental pipeline and compression
facilities necessary for Texas Eastern to render an incremental firm transportation service for CNG Transmission
Corporation (CNG). Texas Eastern states that it filed the Amendment to revise the proposed facilities necessary
to render the service for CNG and to revise the proposed initial rates to be charged for the incremental service for
CNG, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that the revised initial rate is the result of an increase requested by CNG and agreed to by Texas
Eastern in the quantities on gas to be transported for CNG and the facility changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the original application, Texas Eastern proposed to construct and operate certain replacement pipeline and compression
facilities to increase its mainline transmission capacity between the existing interconnection with CNG at the
Crayne Farm meter station, in Waynesburg County, Pennsylvania, and the existing interconnection of Texas Eastern's
system with CNG's Line PL&hyph;1, near the Chambersburg Compressor Station in Chambersburg County, Pennsylvania.
Texas Eastern proposed to provide an incremental 100,000 Dekatherms per day (Dth/d) of transportation capacity
for CNG. Texas Eastern states that CNG proposed to utilize this capacity to render firm transportation service for
CNG customers served off of CNG's PL&hyph;1 Line.

(d) Charge an incremental reservation rate of $7.343 per Dth, as a NGA section 7(c) initial rate separately stated
as part of Texas Eastern's Part 284 FT&hyph;1 Rate Schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern submits that the Amendment reflects the increase in firm transportation service to CNG from an MDQ of
100,000 Dth/d to 105,000 Dth/d, and the changed location and quantity of replacement pipeline necessary to provide
the corresponding increase in firm capacity for CNG. Texas Eastern states that CNG has informed it that CNG intends
to notify the Commission in the near future that CNG intends to render 105,000 Dth/d of firm downstream transportation
service for the CNG customers.

Texas Eastern proposes to build the facilities in order to provide the incremental 105,000 Dth/d capacity required
to render such service. The facilities proposed will be ready for service by November 1, 1995. It is estimated that
the total capital costs of the proposed compression and pipeline facilities in 1995 dollars, is $39,899,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Part 284 service to be rendered to CNG pursuant to Texas Eastern's existing Rate Schedule FT&hyph;1 using the
new capacity contemplated in the application, Texas Eastern proposes to charge CNG, as a NGA section 7 initial charge,
an incremental Reservation Charge separately stated as part of Texas Eastern's Part 284 Rate Schedule FT&hyph;1
rates. Based upon the annual cost of the proposed facility additions, Texas Eastern proposes an initial monthly Reservation
Charge of $7.343 per Dth/d for the firm incremental transportation services beginning November 1, 1995.

Take notice that on July 26, 1994, Algonquin Gas Transmission Corporation (Algonquin), 1284 Soldiers Field Road,
Boston, Massachusetts 02135, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;684&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205,
157.212, and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212 and 157.216)
for authorization to construct and operate facilities at three existing metering and regulating stations to increase
the capacity for deliveries at those stations to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (Con Ed) and to abandon
the facilities that are replaced by the new facilities, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP87&hyph;317&hyph;000,
pursuant to Sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with
the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is stated that Con Ed is a shipper under several of Algonquin's rate schedules, and has requested increased delivery
capacity at three existing points of interconnection between Con Ed and Algonquin for deliveries under Algonquin's
tariff. Algonquin states that Con Ed has requested the construction of appurtenant facilities at existing meter
stations in Peekskill, Cortlandt, and Yorktown, New York. It is indicated that the construction will involve changes
to regulators, meter run headers, meter tubes, heater piping, relief valves, and station instrumentation. Algonquin
states that these facility changes will allow increased maximum daily deliveries at the Peekskill Station from 15,937
million to 19,364 million Btu, at the Cortlandt Station from 3,562 million Btu to 4,002 million Btu, and at the Yorktown
Station from 3,562 million Btu to 19,434 million Btu. Algonquin estimates that the facility changes will cost $427,600,
which will be reimbursed by Con Ed upon the two parties finalizing an appropriate agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Algonquin states that it has sufficient system delivery flexibility to accomplish these deliveries without detriment
or disadvantage to its other customers. It is also indicated that Algonquin's tariff permits Algonquin, at its option
and with the customer's consent, to add facilities and to be reimbursed by the customer for the cost of those facilities.

finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by
the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its
own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.

and pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request.
If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective
the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time
allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to
Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issued in 1984, DOE's 10 CFR Part 960 siting guidelines cover all phases of the siting process including the screening
and comparison of several sites in order to select three for detailed characterization as potential repository sites.
The Department has considered a range of options concerning the application of the guidelines, from revising them
through the rulemaking process to simply continuing to use them in their present form and has found that the guidelines
are applicable to the site suitability process. The Department has decided that it will not amend the siting guidelines.
Therefore, in making suitability decisions that are required at this stage of the siting process, the Department
will use the guidelines as they are currently written. Their use, however, will be subject to the programmatic changes
and reconfiguration provided in the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987. Because the Amendments Act eliminated
all of the pre-characterization stages by requiring the Secretary to proceed with site characterization at Yucca
Mountain and to cease investigation of all other potential sites for the first repository, comparative evaluation
is no longer relevant. Accordingly, the Program will not utilize the comparative portions of the guidelines for purposes
of the suitability assessment of the Yucca Mountain site. This means that the Program will not make specific evaluations
of the favorable and potentially adverse conditions since these tests are primarily for use in comparing sites.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title IV of the Clean Air Act directs EPA to establish a program to reduce the adverse effects of acidic deposition by
promulgating rules and issuing permits to emission sources subject to the program. On January 11, 1993, EPA promulgated
final rules implementing the program. Subsequently, several parties filed petitions for review of the rules with
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On November 18, 1993, EPA published a notice of proposed
revisions to rules regarding Phase I substitution and reduced utilization plans (sections 404 (b) and (c) and 408(c)(1)(B)
of the Act). On May 4, 1994, EPA and other parties signed a settlement agreement addressing the substitution and reduced
utilization issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's action, EPA is issuing permits that are consistent with the May 4, 1994 settlement. Except as noted below,
EPA approves for 1995&hyph;1999 all compliance options for which EPA deferred action for 1996&hyph;1999 in the draft
permits. In addition, except as noted below, the numbers of substitution and compensating unit allowances allocated
to each unit for 1995&hyph;1999 are identical to the numbers of allowances allocated to each unit for 1995 in the draft
permits. The additional allowances discussed below, according to the settlement, are a one-time allocation and
entail a simultaneous deduction of an equal number of allowances in a future year. Upon activation of conditionally-approved
plans, substitution or compensating unit allowances are allocated for the remaining years the plan is in effect.
EPA issues the following permits:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of funds for fiscal year (FY) 1994
for a cooperative agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO) for research initiatives related to chronic
disease prevention and health promotion. Annually, chronic diseases are responsible for significant illness,
death, economic cost, and diminished quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide. Improving methods of
reaching and sustaining healthy lifestyles, promoting health education and disease prevention, and reducing high-risk
activities which result in disease infection will result in significant reduction in mortality and morbidity. Approximately
$312,000 is available in FY 1994 to fund this program. It is expected that the award will begin on or about September
29, 1994, for a 12-month budget period within a project period of up to 3 years. Funding estimates may vary and are subject
to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability
of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this program is for WHO to coordinate the dissemination of comprehensive chronic disease information
and health promotion programmatic expertise among relevant agencies, nations, and health-care professionals
worldwide. Findings from this project will be useful in further reducing the excessive burden of chronic disease
mortality in the United States and in improving the provision of care through more simple and less expensive forms
of technology, as well as contributing immeasurably to reducing the excessive burden of chronic disease mortality
throughout the world. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CDC will collaborate in the design of research protocols, assist in the analysis and interpretation of data generated
from each project, provide, as needed, other programmatic consultation and guidance in support of the program, provide
continuing updates on scientific and operational developments in the areas of categorical and comprehensive chronic
disease prevention and control, participate in the development of plans for the sharing and dissemination of program
and research data and information, and assist in defining the scope, the development, and dissemination of plans
for chronic disease prevention, research, and control.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it intends to conduct a pilot program in which volunteers
from the food manufacturing industry will use the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. This pilot
program is intended to provide information that FDA can use in deciding whether to propose to adopt and, should it decide
to do so, in developing and implementing a regulatory system in which food manufacturers are required to operate based
on HACCP principles. FDA expects that the pilot program will involve a small number of firms making products presenting
a range of risks. FDA is inviting individual firms that wish to participate in this program to submit letters of interest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
), FDA acts to help ensure that foods in interstate commerce are safe. To achieve this goal of safe foods, FDA engages
in a range of activities, including providing guidance about measures that manufacturers can take to ensure the safety
of their products. One such measure is the adoption of HACCP, a systematic approach to the identification and control
of biological, chemical, and physical hazards associated with the production of a particular food. HACCP is recognized
as being particularly effective in limiting the risks from the hazards presented by food processing because each
firm tailors the HACCP approach to fit its specific product, processing, and distribution conditions. For example,
the low-acid canned food regulations contained in part 113 (21 CFR part 113) incorporate the principles of HACCP in
a manner designed to prevent 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Clostridium botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 outgrowth and toxin production in thermally processed, low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers.

In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4142), FDA published a proposal to establish regulations to require the implementation
of HACCP programs by the seafood industry. The agency is now considering action to extend HACCP beyond seafood to the
other food products, domestic and imported, that it regulates. Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA intends to publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that requests comments on the application
of HACCP to the food industry. After the comments to the ANPRM are evaluated and as FDA gathers information from the
pilot program that is the subject of this notice, the agency may begin rulemaking to expand HACCP to other segments
of the food industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To collect information on how HACCP might be implemented in the food industry, FDA is announcing a pilot program designed
to provide insight into the problems, costs, and benefits of developing and implementing HACCP for firms that produce
a variety of food products. This program will also provide the agency with information on the implications for the
agency of implementing a HACCP system. The agency invites individual firms to submit letters of interest in participating
in this voluntary program. FDA will select firms with a goal of ensuring that the participants in the program produce
products that present a range of potential hazards, have a range of scientific capabilities, have processing facilities
of varying sizes, and have a range of HACCP experience. FDA anticipates that this program will provide the selected
firm as well as the agency with extremely useful practical experience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential benefits to industry from participation in the pilot program include: (1) An opportunity to work with
FDA to determine how best to apply HACCP in the firm's particular plant or segment of the food industry, (2) the chance
to engage in a scientific dialogue with FDA, (3) an opportunity to contribute to the development of sound regulatory
policy relative to food safety hazards, and (4) an opportunity to learn how firms can reduce the likelihood of recalls
or seizures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Participation in this pilot program offers several benefits to FDA and to the consumer: (1) Experience gained during
this program may allow the agency to generalize what it has found and to make its insights available to the whole food
industry, (2) the agency will gain experience that it can rely on in deciding whether HACCP is practicable for the food
industry as a whole, and (3) the agency will be able to determine how it can better focus its monitoring of food safety
to concentrate on areas of greatest public health need. Moreover, the agency intends to make a summary of the results
of the pilot program publicly available, which should help other firms, both inside and outside the segments of the
food industry represented in the program, to develop and implement their own HACCP programs, should they choose to
do so, or should the agency require that they do so. This will also serve to increase public understanding of, and involvement
in this new food safety regimen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA requests that individual firms submitting letters of interest provide information concerning the nature of
their products, the size of their processing facility, the processing techniques that they use to manufacture their
products, their scientific capability (e.g., research and development programs, quality control laboratories),
and the extent to which, and how, they employ HACCP (e.g., Does the firm have valid HACCP plans? Is it operating under
those plans? If not, does the firm have the capability to develop and implement HACCP plans?). FDA will consider these
factors in reviewing the letters of interest as a basis for identifying a limited number of individual firms that,
in the judgment of the agency, are best suited to participate in the program. After a list of potential participants
has been compiled, FDA will review the regulatory status and inspectional history of each firm on the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA will meet with the firms that have expressed an interest in participating in the program. At this meeting, FDA will
present the details of the voluntary HACCP pilot program. If a firm is still interested in participation in the program,
it will be visited by the team of FDA employees that will be responsible for the pilot program (the FDA HACCP Pilot Core
Team) and by representatives of the local FDA district office. Representatives of a trade association may also participate
in the visit if invited by the firm. The purpose of the visit will be to allow FDA to assess how well the firm fits within
the agency's goals for the pilot program and to review the firm's HACCP plan, if one exists. Based on the results of these
visits, the FDA HACCP Pilot Core Team will select the firms that will participate in the program. Because FDA's resources
are limited, only a few firms can be selected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each firm selected to participate in the pilot program will be expected to design, develop, and implement its own HACCP
program tailored to control the hazards presented in producing its products and by its processing facility. FDA will
assist each firm that it selects in developing a HACCP program that, at minimum, includes: An employee training program
on HACCP principles; a written general sanitation program that the firm will use to maintain its production facility
in a sanitary manner, in accordance with FDA's regulation, ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing,
Packing, or Holding Human Food'' (21 CFR part 110); and a written HACCP plan based upon the HACCP principles outlined
by the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Food for each product covered by the program.
FDA will expect each firm that participates in the program to agree to: (1) FDA review of its HACCP program before the
firm participates in the pilot program, (2) FDA HACCP-based inspections of its processing facility, (3) FDA review
of the firm's regularly scheduled internal monitoring to determine the degree of compliance with the HACCP plan,
and (4) use of its own resources to accomplish assigned efforts (e.g., developing HACCP plans, training employees
on the HACCP principles, conducting audits of HACCP programs) during the course of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends to implement this program on a carefully controlled basis. Within 6 weeks of the date that a firm is accepted
and operational in its HACCP program, FDA will conduct an initial verification inspection to determine the firm's
compliance with its HACCP program. The firm will be expected to submit monthly verification reports to the FDA HACCP
Pilot Core Team for evaluation. FDA will conduct subsequent verification inspections as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Interested firms are invited to submit a letter of interest to Office of Policy, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives
(HFS&hyph;4), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington,
DC 20204. Letters of interest must be submitted by October 3, 1994.

 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Pub. L. 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged in Urine
Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct urine
drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of performance
testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in an every-other-month
performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service are proposing to change policies and regulations within their
Federal rangeland management programs. These actions are intended to improve and restore a significant portion
of rangeland ecosystems and to improve and maintain biodiversity, while providing for sustainable development
on lands administered by the two agencies. The two agencies are also proposing to revise the formula used to determine
fees charged for grazing livestock on Federal lands in the 17 western states.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau of Land Management, with the cooperation of the Forest Service, has prepared a draft EIS analyzing the environmental
effects of the proposed changes in their rangeland management programs. The draft EIS is a national-level, programmatic
analysis. It documents the ecological, economic, and social impacts that would result from alternative fee formulas
and from reforming, or not reforming, other elements of the Federal rangeland management program. Five management
alternatives are considered in detail: Current Management (No Action); BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action; Livestock
Production; Environmental Enhancement; and No Grazing. Seven grazing fee formula alternatives are also analyzed:
Current Public Rangeland Improvement Act (PRIA) (No Action); Modified PRIA; BLM-Forest Service Proposed Action;
Regional Fees; Federal Forage Fee; PRIA with Surcharges; and Competitive Bidding.

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individuals who may not physically use certain unique or significant resources may hold some value for their existence
and preservation. Passive-use or non-use economic value is a monetary measure of this value. Studies completed under
the Glen Canyon Environmental Studies Program have shown that the operation of Glen Canyon Dam affects downstream
natural and cultural resources in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and Grand Canyon National Park. If individuals
hold passive-use value for resources affected by the timing and amount of the releases from the dam, the magnitude
of these values could be influenced by changes in the way the dam is operated. A small (pilot) test survey was completed
earlier (OMB clearance number 1006&hyph;0013). Data obtained during the pilot test supported the hypothesis that
members of the general public hold passive-use value for these resources and that the magnitude of these values may
change across operational alternatives. A full scale (final) survey is now proposed. Information for the final survey
will be collected from a random sample of the U.S. population in an effort to quantify passive-use value for a range
of dam operation strategies. This information will be available for use by decision makers as they assess the trade-offs
between recreation benefits, power production benefits, and passive-use benefits associated with different strategies
for operating Glen Canyon Dam.

Data collected under this information has been requested for possible consideration in reaching a Record of Decision
on the final Glen Canyon Dam Environmental Impact Statement (GCDEIS). The Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992 stipulates
the completion of the final GCDEIS by October 30, 1994. In order to meet this schedule, it will be necessary to begin
survey administration as soon as clearance is obtained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a technical/agency
draft recovery plan for Carolina heelsplitter (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Lasmigona decorata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). This rare freshwater mussel inhabits cool, slow-moving, small- to medium-sized streams and rivers. The Carolina
heelsplitter currently has a very fragmented, relict distribution but historically was known from several locations
within the Catawaba River and Pee Dee River systems in North Carolina and the Saluda and Pee Dee River systems in South
Carolina. The species is presently know to be surviving in only four streams_Waxhaw Creek (Catawba River system)
Union County, North Carolina; Goose Creek (Pee Dee River system), Union County, North Carolina; Lynches River (Pee
Dee River system), Chesterfield, Lancaster, and Kershaw Counties, South Carolina; and Flat Creek (Pee Dee River
system), a tributary to the Lynches River in Lancaster County, South Carolina. It has been reduced to a few short reaches
of each of these streams, primarily as a result of impoundments and general deterioration of water quality resulting
from siltation and other pollutants contributed by poor land use practices. The Service solicits review and comment
from the public on this draft plan.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining
members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery
effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States.
Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing
the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures
needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is the Carolina heelsplitter (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lasmigona decorata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The area of emphasis for recovery actions is the upper Catawba River and Pee Dee River systems in south-central North
Carolina and north-central South Carolina and the Saluda River system in northwestern South Carolina Habitat protection,
reintroduction, and preservation of genetic material are major objectives of this recovery plan.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action was commenced on April 28, 1994, when the United States filed a complaint alleging that the defendant's
proposed merger violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18. On the same date, the United States
submitted a proposed Final Judgment and a Stipulation between the United States and the dependents pursuant to which
the United States and the defendants consented to entry of the proposed Final Judgment. The Stipulation provides
that the proposed Final Judgment may be entered by the Court after completion of the procedures required by the APPA.

Response to Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has received two comments relating to the proposed Final Judgment. The first comment, filed by K. Lawrence
Kemp, a bankruptcy trustee, was filed on behalf of Dennis F. Gianotti, the owner of GTV, a regional sports video programming
company which has filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.
The second comment was submitted by GTE Service Corporation, on behalf of its affiliated domestic telephone operating
companies and GTE Laboratories Incorporated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of the standard of judicial review, raised by the comments, will be discussed below in Section IV(C).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. K. Lawrence Kemp 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Kemp submitted a copy of an antitrust complaint that has been filed on behalf of Mr. Gianotti and GTV. The complaint
alleges that KBL Sports Network, Inc. and the defendants have attempted to monopolize sports television programming
of collegiate athletics for cable distribution in Western Pennsylvania by interfering with Mr. Gianotti's and GVT's
exclusive rights to produce and distribute such programming. Among other allegations, the complaint alleges that
defendants refused carriage of GTV programming as part of an attempt to monopolize. Mr. Kemp asserts that for the reasons
alleged in the aforementioned complaint, he objects to the proposed Final Judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Final Judgment does not directly address issues relating to competition among firms seeking television
production and distribution rights for sports events.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Department has no basis for a general concern that the proposed transaction will lessen competition among firms
competing for television rights for sports events. However, to the extent that defendants discriminate against
non-affiliated programming in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage, such conduct is encompassed within
the proposed Final Judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<FOOTNAME>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The omission of this issue from the proposed Final Judgment, however, in no way signifies an opinion by the Department
as to the merits of the GTV private lawsuit, nor does entry of the proposed Final Judgment in any way effect the private
lawsuit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section IV(A) of the proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants' cable systems and multichannel subscription television
distributors (``MSTDs'') from discriminating against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms,
or conditions of carriage, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. This provision
does not create an automatic right of access for any individual video programmer to any of defendants' individual
MSTDs, nor is it intended to inhibit good faith negotiations between defendants and unaffiliated programmers regarding
the terms and conditions of carriage. However, where the effect of discrimination by defendants is to restrain competition,
such conduct is prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Section IV(C) extends the prohibitions set forth in Section IV(A) to prevent defendants from seeking
or supporting, with respect to any MSTD in which defendants have any financial interest but do not control, conduct
that would violate Section IV(A) if engaged in by defendants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By prohibiting conduct by defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming, the
Department believes that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged in the Complaint will be fully
remedied. The Department's view as to the sufficiency of this relief also rests on the existence of Sections 12 and
19 of the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;385, 106 Stat. 1460 (1992) (``1992 Cable
Act''), and its implementing Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') regulations, as well as the judgments

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
GTE supports the entry of the proposed Final Judgment but argues that its duration is too short. In addition, GTE expresses
concern that the proposed Final Judgment would allow defendants to withdraw highly appealing programming from distribution_and
specifically from competing systems_upon expiration of the proposed Final Judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GTE recommends (1) that the term of the existing provisions of the proposed Final Judgment be increased from five to
seven years; and (2) that upon expiration of this seven year period, defendants should be restrained from withdrawing
any programming from distribution in a particular market unless that market is found to be subject to ``effective
competition'' within the meaning of Section 623(l)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act&sect;
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 or unless such programming is withdrawn from all markets, specifically including any and all systems in which defendants
have an interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the United States explains why it limited the term of the proposed Final Judgment to five years. The five year term reflects
the United States' ``recognition that this industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies
that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations.''
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The United States continues to believe that for this transaction in this industry, with changing technology, substantial
new entry as well as recent and substantial government regulation, a term of five years is a sufficient period of time
and is in the public interest.

The United States also believes that it is in the public interest not to place additional restrictions upon defendants
after the expiration of the proposed Final Judgment. Federal antitrust laws as well as the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing
FCC regulations should provide adequate protection against potential anticompetitive behavior in programming
distribution upon expiration of the proposed Final Judgment.

The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a
sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is
in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court may consider: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement
and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered,
and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;

 356 U.S. 1, 4 (1958), the focus of the ``public interest'' inquiry under the Tunney Act is whether the proposed final
judgment would serve the public interest in free and unfettered competition.

 Rather, absent a showing of corrupt failure of the government to discharge its duty, the Court, in making the public
interest finding, should *&blank;*&blank;* carefully consider the explanations of the government in the competitive
impact statement and its responses to comments in order to determine whether those explanations are reasonable under
the circumstances.

Impact Statement and Response to Comments filed pursuant to the APPA. Although the APPA authorizes the use of additional
procedures, 15 U.S.C. 16(f), those procedures are discretionary. A court need not invoke any of them unless it believes

[t]he balancing of competing social and political interests affected by a proposed antitrust consent decree must
be left, in the first instance, to the discretion of the Attorney General. The court's role in protecting the public
interest is one of insuring that the government has not breached its duty to the public in consenting to the decree.
The court is required to determine not whether particular decree is the one that will best serve society, but whether
the settlement is ``within the reaches of the public interest.'' More elaborate requirements might undermine the
effectiveness of antitrust enforcement by consent decree.

A proposed consent decree is an agreement between the parties which is reached after exhaustive negotiations and
discussions. Parties do not hastily and thoughtlessly stipulate to a decree because, in doing so, they

waive their right to litigate the issues involved in the case and thus save themselves the time, expense, and inevitable
risk of litigation. Naturally, the agreement reached normally embodies a compromise; in exchange for the saving
of cost and the elimination of risk, the parties each give up something they might have won had they proceeded with the
litigation.

The proposed consent decree, therefore, should not be reviewed under a standard of whether it is certain to eliminate
every conceivable anticompetitive effect of a merger or whether it mandates certainty of free competition in the
future. The court may reject the agreement of the parties as to how the public interest is best served only if it has ``exceptional

Court approval of a final judgment requires a standard more flexible and less strict than the standard required for
a finding of liability. ``[A] proposed decree must be approved even if it falls short of the remedy the court would impose

 Under the public interest standard, the Court's role is limited to determining whether the proposed decree is within

view of what would best serve the public interest.

Clearly, there has been no showing that the proposed settlement constitutes an abuse of the Department's discretion
or that it is not within the zone of settlements consistent with the public interest. The proposed Final Judgment would
enjoin defendants' cable systems and other multichannel subscription television distributors from discriminating
against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage where the effect of
such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. Defendants also would be enjoined, with respect to their video
programming, from refusing to license on nondiscriminatory terms to any competing multichannel subscription television
distributor where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. The Department believes that
entry of the proposed Final Judgment willfully remedy the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged
in the Complaint, by prohibiting conduct by defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video
programming or multichannel subscription television distribution.

Factual Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Gianotti was engaged in the business of producing television programs primarily for use on cable television and
primarily of a sports nature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. On or about October 19, 1989, Gianotti entered into a written agreement with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic
Department for the production of certain sports telecasts. The Agreement was for a term of two years from October 21,
1989, to October 21, 1991. The Agreement gave exclusive broadcast and cable distribution rights to Gianotti. The
Agreement provided for an exclusive 30-day negotiating period following October 21, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. During the term of the said Agreement, Gianotti produced various sports television programs involving University
of Pittsburgh athletic events and arranged for the viewing of such programs through KBL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Gianotti provided KBL with a copy of his said Agreement with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department
prior to the first cable distribution of such a program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Although Gianotti's dealings were formally with KBL, he was paid for programming by checks of TCI mailed to his
address is Pennsylvania from TCI's office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Before the end of the term of the said agreement, in August, 1991, KBL successfully negotiated directly with the
University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department to provide for the production of the same sports events covered by the
said Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. In the spring of 1991, in order to harm Gianotti's chances of extending his contractual relationship with the University
of Pittsburgh, KBL refused to provide cable distribution of University of Pittsburgh men's baseball games and other
sports events such as auto racing from Gianotti. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. In a concerted effort to take over Gianotti's business, KBL cancelled his Steeler Talk Show and replaced it with
its own Sports Beat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. KBL directly approached and contracted with advertisers developed by Gianotti, such as Carriage Limousine and
Coors Beer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. In February, 1991, in a meeting between William Craig, a managerial employee of KBL, and Gianotti, William Craig
told Gianotti that KBL would not distribute any University of Pittsburgh athletic events unless KBL could distribute
men's basketball. When Gianotti offered to produce men's basketball, William Craig rejected the offer and advised
him that KBL wanted to negotiate that directly with the University of Pittsburgh.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. At and after the meeting, Gianotti offered to buy or barter time to get his programs distributed by defendant, but
KBL refused to quote him a price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. KBL is and was owned directly or indirectly by TCI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. TCI directly or indirectly (through its subsidiary TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc.) dominated the Metropolitan Pittsburgh
cable television market by having approximately half the cable television subscribers in the said market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. Because KBL was owned by TCI and/or Liberty (the two of which were related) which had more than half the cable subscribers
in this area, KBL could and did exercise market power over collegiate sports television programming in the Metropolitan
Pittsburgh area.

24. The existence of market power by KBL and TCI is evidenced by the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) One of TCI's subsidiaries, TCI of Pennsylvania, refused to deal with TCS, an entity which first acquired cable
television transmission rights to Pittsburgh Pirate baseball games. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) TCI through various of its subsidiaries refused to deal with Sportschannel, an entity which offers sports programming
of national and regional interest. If TCI of Pennsylvania had carried Sportschannel, Sportschannel would have competed
with KBL for rights to regional sports events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) KBL reasonably believed it could impose a seat fee on commercial establishments such as bars which provide a television
set for its patrons to watch programs on KBL and actually did impose such a fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) KBL refused to deal with Gianotti on programming it previously found acceptable for the sole purpose of eliminating
him as an intermediary between sports programming sources such as the University of Pittsburgh and other programming
sources on the one side and KBL and the cable television systems on the other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) KBL and/or TCI is now attempting to acquire the Pittsburgh Pirates so that it can control broadcast, telecast and
cable casting of Pirate games. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) TCI became a co-owner of K-Prime Partners, Limited Partnership also known as Primestar on February 8, 1990, in
an effort to dominate video sports programming. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) TCI through its subsidiary TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc., has had the only cable television service within the City
of Pittsburgh between 1984 and the present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) In December, 1993, TCI of Pennsylvania had approximately 385,000 cable television subscribers in the Metropolitan
Pittsburgh area, more than half the total subscribers in this area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) TCI directly or indirectly through a subsidiary bought the City of Pittsburgh cable television franchise from
Warner Cable Corp. in 1984 for approximately $93,400,000.00. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) The Chief Executive Officer of TCI is John Malone, who also owns 50.4% of the common stock of Liberty Media, Inc.,
a Colorado business corporation. TCI and Liberty Media through their various subsidiaries have 10 million cable
television subscribers, more than 25% of the total number of cable television subscribers of the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) John Malone, TCI and Liberty Media during the past two decades have embarked on a course of conduct designed to control
cable television and by acquiring control over programming sources, technology and franchises. In particular,
TCI and Liberty have, during this period of time acquired
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 22% of Turner Broadcasting which provides TBS, TNT, CNN and the Cartoon Network. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 49% of QVC
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 49% of the Discovery Channel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 42% of the Home Shopping Network
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 33% of Court TV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) 21% of Home Team Sports
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) 68% of SportsCom
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) 18% of Black Entertainment Network
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) 90% of Encore
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) 15.6% of The Family Channel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) 15% of Interactive Network
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In addition TCI and/or Liberty Media have become involved in partnerships or joint ventures in The Children's
Channel, the Parliamentary Channel, TeleWest, The Sega Channel and Viewer Controlled Cable Television.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) In April, 1993, KBL acquired exclusive broadcast rights for 4 years for the Pittsburgh Penguins for approximately
$22,000,000.00. This acquisition enabled KBL to sell rights to certain games to broadcast stations such as KDKA&hyph;TV
and to institute pay-per-view as to certain games. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) KBL also acquired exclusive television broadcasting rights to the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(o) KBL, after contracting with the University of Pittsburgh for men's basketball, was able to charge an additional
fee to cable system operators for such programming, a fee over and above the regular charge for KBL programming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. John Malone, through TCI and its subsidiaries and liberty Media and its subsidiaries has engaged in an effort to
exercise monopolistic control over programming sources by the above acquisitions and by encouraging independent
programming sources, such as The Learning Channel, to merge into entities over which they have control such as, The
Discovery Channel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. The elimination of GTV as a programming source enabled KBL, an entity controlled by Malone, TCI and/or Liberty
Media, to deal directly with the University of Pittsburgh on terms favorable to defendants for basketball by tying
the acceptance of minor sports programming to basketball.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. By its conduct Defendants have violated 15 U.S.C. &sect;1 in that KBL has, by contracting directly with the University
of Pittsburgh Athletic Department to produce and distribute sports events covered by the Agreement with Gianotti,
restrained trade and commerce by interfering with Gianotti's opportunity to do business with the University of Pittsburgh.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. One of the purposes of KBL said conduct was to monopolize sports television production of collegiate athletics
for cable distribution in Western Pennsylvania in violation of 15 U.S.C. &sect;2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. Another of the purposes of KBL said conduct was to tie the distribution of men's basketball to the distribution
of other sports events in order to deprive others from an opportunity to telecast or distribute by cable men's basketball
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. Defendants' conduct had a substantially adverse affect on competition in that it eliminated a major cable television
programming source and left Defendants in the position to exercise market power over the origination of sports programming
for cable television in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. KBL is capable of monopolizing this market because of its relationship with TCI of Pennsylvania, Inc., which has
more than half the cable subscribers in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. In this instance and in the past, defendants and their affiliated corporations have used refusals to deal with
program sources as a means to exercise their market power to control programming sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. The various actions taken by defendants and their affiliated corporations have decreased competition by eliminating
Gianotti and possibly others such as TCS and possibly discouraging them and others from entering this expanding market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. Although broadcast television stations also show some local sports events, they are restrained by two factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Because of their necessity to maintain certain minimum numbers of viewers and correspondingly certain minimum
advertising rates, they cannot show minor collegiate athletic events or other sports and non-sports programming
not designed to appeal to significant segments of the Viewing population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Defendants through their acquisition of exclusive rights to University of Pittsburgh Basketball, the Pittsburgh
Penguins and the Pittsburgh Pirates now control which of these events can be shown on regular broadcast stations.
For example, WPXI Channel 11 had to contract with KBL to be able to show certain University of Pittsburgh Basketball
games.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. Because of the conduct of defendants, Gianotti was forced out of the business he was building which in 1990 generated
gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. Gianotti was the largest source of independent local video programming in the Pittsburgh Metropolitan area between
1988 and 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. Had defendants not so conducted themselves, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to
earn far more than $50,000.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. The fair market value of Gianotti business prior to the said course of conduct of defendants was in excess of $100,000.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39. Pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 15 plaintiffs are entitled to recover threefold the damages sustained plus prejudgment
interest plus attorneys fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wherefore, Plaintiffs request judgment against Defendant for $300,000.00 plus interest from October 21, 1991,
at the federal judgment rate plus reasonable attorneys fees.

40. In violation of 15 U.S.C. 18, KBL acquired an asset of Gianotti in the form of his exclusive right to negotiate a renewal
of his contract with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department, where the effect of such acquisition substantially
lessened competition by driving Gianotti out of business chilling interest in entry into this market by others, depriving
advertisers and sports teams of alternatives and tended to create a monopoly in the production of sports television
programming for cable distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. Because of the conduct of defendants, Gianotti was forced out of the business he built up which in 1990 generated
gross receipts of $325,102.65 and a net profit to him of $12,273.80.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. Had defendants not so conducted themselves, Gianotti's business would have grown and he would have been able to
earn far more than $50,000.00.

45. By dealing directly with the University of Pittsburgh Athletic Department before the expiration of the exclusive
negotiating period under the Department's contract with Gianotti, KBL tortiously interfered with his advantageous
contractual and business relationship with the Department.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

47. Because of the conduct of KBL, Dennis F. Gianotti was forced out of the business he built up which in 1990 generated

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the proposed Final Judgment (hereinafter, Consent Decree) is a worthy attempt to stem the anti-competitive
conduct rampant in the cable industry today_of which Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) and Liberty Media Corp. (Liberty)
are major players_it suffers from two primary flaws. First, the term of the Consent Decree is clearly inadequate.
Second, the Consent Decree would permit TCI/Liberty to withdraw high appealing programming from distribution_and
specifically from competing systems_upon expiration of the term of the Consent Decree. To remedy these flaws, GTE
recommends: (1) That the term of the existing provisions of the Consent Decree be increased to seven years, and (2)
that upon expiration of this seven year period, TCI/Liberty should be restrained from withdrawing any programming
from distribution in a particular market unless that market is found to be subject to ``effective competition'' within
the meaning of Section 623(l)(1) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 or unless such programming is withdrawn from all markets, specifically including any and all systems in which TCI
or Liberty has an interest.

II. Statement of Facts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the distribution of multichannel video programming is overwhelmingly dominated by the cable industry.
Cable systems are accessible to ninety-six percent of television households in American and over sixty percent of
those households subscribe. Annual cable revenues now exceed twenty-one billion dollars, and the industry has been
increasingly controlled by large Multiple Systems Operators (MSOs), including TCI and Liberty.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 From the customer's perspective, ninety-nine percent of all cable customers have only one cable operator to choose
from.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 As the industry exists today, the transport of video programming to consumers is a monopoly service.

See National Cable Television Association, Cable Television Developments (March, 1993). The merged TCI and Liberty
entities will serve more than thirteen million customers_a quarter of the nation's cable subscribers_and have financial
interests in a wide range of programming services including a number of the most popular and widely-carried services.

The most promising potential competition to entrenched cable interests comes from local exchange carriers (LECs),
including GTE's domestic telephone operating companies. While LECs are presently prohibited from providing video
programming to customers in their own service territories,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 recent action by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allows LECs to provide common carrier transport of
the video signals of unaffiliated programmers, know a video dialtone (VDT).
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 While LECs look forward to providing consumers with a competitive alternative to incumbent cable operators like
TCI and Liberty, these operators have fought vigorously to stave off competition at every turn.

III. The Consent Decree Must be Modified
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To its credit, the Consent Decree seeks to discourage TCI/Liberty's anti-competitive conduct with respect to multichannel
subscription television distributors (MSTDs) and video programming providers (VPVs).
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 However, TCI/Liberty's existing monopoly position, the cable industry's long history of anti-competitive conduct,
coupled with their current attempts to derail all potential competition, present a clear and present danger that
the provisions of the Consent Decree will be woefully inadequate. In particular, the restraints imposed by the Consent
Decree appear to be lifted at the very point in time when competition will likely be becoming a reality.

A consent decree is not merely a private contract between the parties; it is a judicial decree backed by the contempt
power of the Court. Thus, in approving the decree, ``the Court performs a judicial function and is called upon to decide
whether it is equitable to enter the decree as proposed by [the parties].''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The development of viable competition to entrenched monopoly cable interests is wholly contingent upon two requirements:
competitors' access to appealing programming, and use of existing and proposed distribution networks. To be viable,
a competitor must be able to assemble an attratctive package of programs to offer to consumers and have the ability
to distribute its offerings. Because of these requirements, the merged TCI-Liberty entitles constitute a bottleneck_if
not a stranglehold_upon the development of viable competition in the video marketplace. Only the closest scrutiny
of the merged entity's conduct will ensure that the public interest is served in the development of effective alternatives
to cable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary flaw in the Consent Decree is its term. The five-year period proposed is simply inadequate. The video dialtone
facilities proposed by LECs_the principal potential competition to cable_will not reach a payback point for least
seven years.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 During this period, as nascent competition to cable more fully develops, LECs' video dialtone networks may be particularly
vulnerable to anti-competitive conduct by TCI/Liberty. Indeed, as actual competition develops toward the end of
this period, TCI/Liberty will have even greater incentives to engage in anti-competitive conduct to stem the loss
of market share. In order to cure this deficiency, the term of the Consent Decree must be not less than seven years.

A transition period is also necessary as the Consent Decree period comes to an end. In particular, at that point, it
would be in TCI/Liberty's interest to withdraw appealing programming from competitive systems and packages. To
prevent this from happening, the Consent Decree must be modified to prohibit TCI/Liberty from withdrawing any programming
from a particular market unless the market in question is found to be subject to ``effective competition,'' as defined
by Section 623(l)(1) of the Act. Of course, TCI/Liberty might have legitimate reasons for the withdrawal of some programming.
Therefore, this prohibition would not apply to the extent that TCI/Liberty also withdrew the same programming from
all systems in which it has an interest. Once withdrawn, this programming could not be made subsequently available
to any TCI/Liberty system unless made generally available to all MSTDs under similar terms and conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these serious deficiencies, the Consent Decreee allows TCI/Liberty broad latitude for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
discrimination. For example, TCI/Liberty could construct a price per volume table so that most local packagers could
not afford appealing programming. TCI/Liberty could also set the volume price for programming high, charge this
high price to its own systems and utilize the greater profit to reward those systems meeting market retention and growth
incentive objectives. In essence, TCI/Liberty could provide its own systems with both incentives and a discount.
Careful scrutiny on a going-forward basis is therefore required if TCI/Liberty is to be restrained from crushing
developing competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without rectification of these inadequacies, the court will not be able to affirmatively find ``the propriety and
equity of the decree proposed.'' Since the Consent Decree, as presently proposed, does not serve the public interest,
it must be modified or rejected by the Court.

IV. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated hereinabove, GTE beleives that the Department must withdraw its stipulation to the Consent
Decree 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
unless 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) the term of the existing provisions of the Consent Decree be increased to at least seven years, and (2) upon expiration
of this seven year period, TCI/Liberty is further restrained from withdrawing any programming from distribution
unless such programming is similarly withdrawn from all markets, specifically including all systems in which TCI
or Liberty has an interest, or the specific market from which it is withdrawn has been found to be subject to ``effective
competition'' within the meaning of Section 621(l)(1) of the Act.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires that the Attorney General establish aggregate
production quotas for each basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedules I and II. This responsibility
has been delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The
Administrator, in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6,
1994).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The quotas are to provide adequate supplies of each substance for: (1) The estimated medical, scientific, research,
and industrial needs of the United States; (2) lawful export requirements; and (3) the establishment and maintenance
of reserve stocks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the below listed proposed 1995 aggregate production quotas, the Deputy Administrator considered
the following factors: (1) Total actual 1993 and estimated 1994 and 1995 net disposals of each substance by all manufacturers;
(2) estimates of 1994 year end inventories of each substance and of any substance manufactured from it and trends in
accumulation of such inventories; and (3) projected demand as indicated by procurement quota applications filed
pursuant to &sect;1303.12 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;1303.23(c) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Deputy Administrator of the DEA will,
in early 1995, adjust aggregate production quotas and individual manufacturing quotas allocated for the year based
upon 1994 year-end inventory and actual 1994 disposition data supplied by quota recipients for each basic class of
Schedule I or II controlled substance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
proposes that the aggregate production quotas for 1995 for the following controlled substances, expressed in grams
of anhydrous acid or base, be established as follows:

Aggregate production quotas for all other Schedules I and II controlled substances included in &sect;&sect;1308.11
and 1308.12 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations are established at zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All interested persons are invited to submit their comments and objections in writing regarding this proposal. A
person may object to or comment on the proposal relating to any of the above-mentioned substances without filing comments
or objections regarding the others. If a person believes that one or more of these issues warrant a hearing, the individual
should so state and summarize the reasons for this belief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that comments or objections to this proposal raise one or more issues which the Deputy Administrator finds
warrant a hearing, the Deputy Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C., 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The establishment of annual aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated
by law and by international treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large
manufacturers, their impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator
has determined that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<DOCTITLE>Avner Kauffman, M.D.; Denial of Application for Registration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 7, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Avner Kauffman, M.D., (Respondent), 12620 S. Harlem Avenue, Palos Heights,
Illinois 60463. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate of Registration,
alleging that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21
U.S.C. 823(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause asserted in part that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest
in light of his 1985 felony conviction for delivery of a controlled substance. Respondent's previous DEA Certificate
of Registration was revoked by the DEA in September 1985. The Order to Show Cause further alleged that following the
revocation of Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, he continued to prescribe controlled substances in
violation of the Controlled Substances Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the allegations raised in the Order to Show Cause and the matter
was placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On September 29 and 30, 1992, a hearing was
held in Chicago, Illinois. On September 22, 1993, the administrative law judge issued her opinion, recommended ruling,
findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision. Neither the Government nor Respondent filed exceptions to the
recommended ruling. On October 22, 1993, the administrative law judge transmitted the record in this proceeding
to the Administrator. Having considered the record in its entirety, and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator
hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon the findings of fact and conclusions of law set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the hearing, a lieutenant from the Illinois State Police testified that on January 27, 1984, he purchased 2.2 grams
of cocaine from Respondent during an undercover investigation. The next contact between the two occurred on January
31, 1984, when the lieutenant spoke to Respondent on the telephone. During the conversation, Respondent informed
the lieutenant that he would sell the lieutenant half an ounce of cocaine for $1,100. Respondent and the lieutenant
met later that day, but Respondent was unable to deliver the cocaine as discussed. Respondent, however, gave the lieutenant
six tablets of Seconal, a Schedule II controlled substance. Respondent did not conduct a physical examination of
the lieutenant and the Seconal was not provided for any medical purpose. Additionally, Respondent offered to provide
the lieutenant with Quaaludes, then a Schedule II controlled substance. During their meeting, Respondent also informed
the lieutenant that he had once smuggled a kilogram of cocaine from Florida; had previously lost about $30,000 worth
of cocaine in bad drug deals; and could obtain another kilogram of cocaine for $50,000 if the lieutenant were interested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lieutenant and Respondent next spoke on February 1, 1984, to discuss another cocaine purchase. At a meeting later
that night at Respondent's office, the lieutenant bought 14 grams of cocaine from Respondent for $1,100. During the
meeting, Respondent commented on the quality of the cocaine and promised that it was better than the cocaine previously
sold to the lieutenant. The lieutenant testified that this was the last time he purchased cocaine from Respondent,
although he attempted additional undercover buys on several occasions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent was arrested on February 9, 1984. Following his arrest, Respondent stated that he had purchased cocaine
``10&hyph;15'' times and had smoked cocaine. Respondent was indicted on March 2, 1984, on three counts of delivery
of a controlled substance. Respondent pled guilty to one count and was sentenced on February 1, 1985, to three years
probation and a $3,000 fine.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of his conviction, on March 23, 1984, the Illinois Department of Registration and Education summarily
suspended Respondent's controlled substance license. In June 1985, Respondent entered into a Consent Agreement
suspending Respondent's medical license but staying the suspension, placing him on probation and suspending his
controlled substance license for five years. Respondent was further ordered to perform 120 hours of volunteer medical
service for each year of probation, to continue psychiatric treatment, and to file biennial reports certifying compliance
with these conditions. Based on his lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances, the then-Administrator
of the Drug Enforcement Administration revoked Respondent's previous DEA Certificate of Registration, effective
September 23, 1985.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent's Illinois Physician and Surgeon License expired on July 31, 1987. He continued to practice medicine
but did not renew his license until December 1988. In April 1990, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation
(IDPR) issued an order finding that Respondent had practiced medicine without a license, reprimanded him, and imposed
a $1,000 fine. At the hearing in this matter, Respondent admitted that he had a made a mistake by not renewing his license
immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent filed an application for registration with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEA on June 8, 1990. At that time, a DEA investigator conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a pharmacy survey for the period 1988&hyph;1990. The investigator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that five prescriptions for controlled substances had been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called in to local pharmacies, allegedly by Respondent, after his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DEA Certificate of Registration was revoked. Some prescriptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 contained the names and DEA registration numbers of other doctors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and had Respondent's name crossed out on the prescription. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescription contained Respondent's retired DEA registration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number and another contained Respondent's revoked DEA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registration number. Respondent testified during the hearing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this matter that he may have authorized the prescriptions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 explained that he mistakenly thought that he was permitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribe controlled substances. Respondent added that in late 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1990, after consulting his attorney, he ``completely stopped'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizing prescriptions for controlled substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An investigator with IDPR testified that in 1991 he began an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation of Respondent after receiving a complaint from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 local pharmacist. The pharmacist was concerned about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent's use of the non-controlled substance Stadol. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pharmacist found Respondent's purchases of Stadol unusual for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pediatrician. Testimony was presented at the hearing regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent's alleged misuse of Stadol. However, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative law judge correctly noted, Stadol is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled substance. Therefore, these allegations were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granted great weight by either the administrative law judge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Deputy Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), the Deputy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator may revoke a DEA Certificate of Registration or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deny an application for registration if he determines that the registration would be inconsistent with the public
interest. Section 823(f) requires that the following factors be considered: (1) The recommendation of the appropriate
State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing, or
conducting research with respect to controlled substances: (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal
or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) compliance with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other
conduct which may threaten the public health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors when determining whether an application
should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S., 51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks,
M.D. 51 FR 41030 (1986). The administrative law judge correctly found that all these factors were relevant to a determination
of whether Respondent's registration would be in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that the Illinois licensing board, IDPR, has taken action against Respondent on more
than one occasion. IDPR summarily suspended Respondent's controlled substance license based on his felony conviction
and later reprimanded him for practicing without a license. The Deputy Administrator also finds that Respondent's
past conduct indicates a cavalier attitude towards the dispensing and prescribing of controlled substances. Providing
the undercover officer with Seconal for no legitimate medical purpose reveals a serious lack of judgment, as does
Respondent's explanation for his continued prescribing of controlled substances following the revocation of his
DEA Certificate of Registration. Respondent's felony conviction for distribution of cocaine again evidences a
dangerous indifference for the law. This conviction, along with Respondent's failure to abide by DEA regulations,
proves that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Respondent cannot be trusted to comply with laws relating to controlled substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator agrees with the administrative law judge that, after considering the applicable factors
pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), Respondent's registration would not be in the public interest and adopts her recommended
decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant
to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that
Avner Kauffman's application for registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective August 4, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 29, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Timothy H. Reese, M.D. (Respondent), of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, proposing
to deny his application for registration as a practitioner. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was
placed on the docket of Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing
was held in Arlington, Virginia, on May 18, 1993. On March 8, 1994, in her findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended
ruling, the administrative law judge recommended that Respondent's application for DEA registration be denied.
No exceptions were filed by either party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 8, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator
has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final
order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found that the Respondent is an emergency room physician who completed a three-year
residency in family practice in 1977, and then became affiliated with medical groups that provided emergency room
coverage for various hospitals. Respondent also maintained a small, private practice until April 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1984, an investigator for the Ohio State Medical Board (Board) obtained from a pharmacy various prescriptions
for controlled substances written by Respondent. Most of the prescriptions bore the address of Respondent's residence,
and were written for members of Respondent's family. The investigator interviewed some of Respondent's family members
that were purportedly issued prescriptions by the Respondent, and they denied ever receiving prescriptions for
him. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thereafter, the Board subpoenaed Respondent's patient records, however, Respondent indicated that they had been
destroyed. Respondent was then requested to appear before the Board to explain why he wrote the prescriptions at issue.
In his deposition before the Board, Respondent states that he did not know what controlled substances were, what schedules
certain controlled substances were in, and that he wrote these prescriptions mainly for weight loss. In 1986, the
Board's investigation of Respondent concluded with no charges being filed.

In 1989, a sergeant with the Columbus (Ohio) Police Department, Narcotics Bureau (Narcotics Bureau), was informed
by local pharmacists of their suspicions regarding prescriptions issued by the Respondent. The prescriptions were
for large quantities of controlled substances, typically Dilaudid. The pharmacists were unfamiliar with the patients
bringing in the prescriptions, and the patients named on the prescriptions did not have local addresses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pharmacists further informed the Narcotics Bureau sergeant that the physician's telephone number listed on
some of the prescriptions was disconnected, and that other prescriptions bore telephone numbers either at emergency
rooms in Pennsylvania, or a residence in Westerville, Ohio. A confidential informant later advised the Narcotics
Bureau that Respondent wrote prescriptions to members of his family and friends, and they in turn returned the prescribed
drugs to Respondent, who used them to treat his wife's heroin addiction. As a result of this information, the Narcotics
Bureau seized a number of Dilaudid prescriptions issued by Respondent from local pharmacies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation by the Narcotics Bureau also revealed that: One of the individuals that attempted to fill a controlled
substance prescription was seen by the pharmacist driving a car registered to Respondent's address; several of the
individuals did not reside at the address listed on their prescriptions; an individual stated that she used cocaine
while in Respondent's home, sold cocaine to Respondent, and was offered cocaine by the Respondent to fill a prescription,
which she refused; Respondent asked the same individual to fill a prescription for Dilaudid, and the individual later
prepared syringes of Dilaudid and water that Respondent's wife injected; all of the telephone numbers for Respondent
on the prescriptions corresponded to emergency rooms in Pennsylvania. Respondent testified at the hearing, that
someone falsified his signature on the prescriptions found by the Narcotics Bureau.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent testified that after he and his wife separated in April 1989, and he moved from their Westerville, Ohio
residence, he believed that his wife continued to live in the residence until her eviction for non-payment of rent.
Respondent further testified that he left behind all of his belongings, including prescription pads printed with
the address of his residence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1989, a DEA diversion investigator observed the wife's eviction from Respondent's home. Among the items
removed from the home and subsequently recovered by DEA, were drug paraphernalia items, including a white powder
substance in a plastic container and pipes containing residue. The items later tested positive for sodium bicarbonate,
oxycodone, and cocaine. The Narcotics Bureaus sergeant testified at the hearing that despite the information disclosed
by the investigation, the Respondent was not criminally charged because he moved out of the State of Ohio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following Respondent's relocation to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on October 26, 1989, DEA informed him that
he was under investigation for diverting Dilaudid. In response to this information, Respondent surrendered his
DEA registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1991, Respondent executed an application for DEA registration, and answered affirmatively, the question
regarding whether he had ever surrendered a previous registration. DEA then initiated a pre-registration investigation
of the Respondent. The investigation revealed that, in 1990, when Respondent began working for a physicians' group
that provided medical services, he informed his employer that he was registered with DEA, and provided his surrendered
registration number. DEA later obtained Respondent's application for employment at a health care facility in Mount
Pleasant, Pennsylvania, where Respondent was associated as an emergency room physician. In response to a question
on the application for employment regarding his registration status, Respondent again stated that he held a current
DEA registration, and listed his surrendered registration number. DEA also discovered numerous prescriptions
issued by Respondent in 1990 and 1991, in which he repeatedly used his surrendered DEA registration number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent testified that his wife used heroin and cocaine, that she was taking methadone, and that she had access
to his DEA number. Respondent also testified that he has never abused drugs, been charged with using drugs, or kept
drug paraphernalia in his home. Respondent acknowledged however that he never informed his employers of the surrender
of his DEA registration, because his lack of registration would preclude his employment. Respondent further acknowledged
that he wrote prescriptions for controlled substances after the surrender of his DEA registration because his work
required him to do so, and that he needed his DEA registration to continue his career as an emergency room physician.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Deputy Administrator may deny any application for such registration, if he determines
that the continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. In determining the public interest,
the following factors are considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the distribution, or dispensing of
controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Deputy Administrator
may properly rely on any one or a combination of the factors and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. See

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In considering whether grounds exist to deny Respondent's application for DEA registration, the administrative
law judge found factors two, four and five relevant in light of evidence regarding Respondent's falsification of
employment applications, representing that he held a DEA registration after he had surrendered the registration;
and, Respondent's issuing of prescriptions for controlled substances using his surrendered DEA registration number.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative law judge found, that despite Respondent's explanations regarding his falsifying employment
applications and writing prescriptions with a surrendered DEA registration number, Respondent showed no remorse,
and appeared to consider his actions justified by exigent circumstances. The administrative law judge also found
with respect to the prescriptions for Dilaudid, that Respondent's testimony was not responsive nor particularly
credible. The administrative law judge further found that Respondent's admission that other persons, including
his wife whom Respondent knew to be a drug abuser, had access to his prescription pads, showed that Respondent had little
respect for the responsibilities of being a DEA registrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Judge Bittner concluded that the preponderance of the credible evidence established that it is unlikely that Respondent
would competently or reliably discharge the obligations inherent in a DEA registration, and further concluded that
it would not be in the public interest to grant his application. Therefore, the administrative law judge recommended
that Respondent's application for DEA registration be denied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator having considered the entire record adopts the administrative law judge's findings of
fact, conclusions of law, and recommended ruling in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and
0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that the application for registration, executed by Timothy H. Reese, M.D., be,
and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective August 4, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>James H. Sanders, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 12, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to James H. Sanders, M.D. (Respondent), of Barbourville, Kentucky.
The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Sanders' DEA Certificate of Registration, AS6935918, and deny any pending
applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent was not currently
authorized to handle controlled substances in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and that Respondent's continued registration
would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause alleged that: Since 1986, DEA received complaints regarding Respondent's excessive prescribing
of controlled substances to individuals for no legitimate medical reason; between December 1991 and September 1992,
DEA conducted an undercover investigation during which Respondent prescribed controlled substances to undercover
agents upon request without performing any physical examination or taking a medical history; during the investigation,
Respondent was observed prescribing controlled substances to other individuals in the same manner as he issued prescriptions
to the undercover agents; in October 1992, DEA conducted a prescription survey of five pharmacies in Barbourville,
Kentucky, which revealed that between April 1, 1992 and October 29, 1992, Respondent prescribed 229,090 dosage units
of controlled substances; and on December 9, 1992, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, State Board of Medical Licensure
(Board) seized 43 patient records from Respondent's office.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause further alleged that on January 21, 1993, the Board issued an Order of Temporary Suspension
suspending Respondent's license to practice medicine in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. On March 2, 1993, the Board
lifted the suspension of Respondent's medical license, however, his controlled substances privileges remained
suspended. As a result, Respondent is no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent, through counsel, filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the order to Show Cause, and the matter
was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On November 19, 1993, the Government filed a motion
for summary disposition, which was accompanied by a letter from the General Counsel to the Board, dated October 20,
1993, as to the status of Respondent's controlled substance privileges in Kentucky. The Government argued that since
Respondent is not currently authorized in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to handle controlled substances, DEA could
not continue to maintain his registration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 14, 1993, Respondent filed a response to the Government's motion, asserting, in substance, that Respondent's
state license had been temporarily restricted to limit his ability to prescribe controlled substances and that on
February 22, 1994, the Board would reach a final decision regarding Respondent's privileges to practice medicine
in Kentucky.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 20, 1993, the administrative law judge issued a Memorandum to Counsel affording Respondent until March
15, 1994, to file a statement as to the status of his authority to handle controlled substances in Kentucky. No such
statement has been filed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 7, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent
did not deny that his state license to practice medicine has been restricted. The administrative law judge therefore,
granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration
be revoked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 10, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator
has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final
order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety.
The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly
authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f)
and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See

The administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled
that when no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding
involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not
intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks.

Stock Exchange's Major Market Index (``MMI''). The MMI is a broad-based, price-weighted index currently based on
20 stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

As the NASD indicated in its rule filing, the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service (``ACT'') is the primary
facility for collecting, processing, and disseminating transaction reports on Nasdaq securities as well as equity
issues quoted in the OTCBB.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 ACT also facilitates the clearance and settlement of inter-member transactions by locking-in trade details for
transmission to the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'').
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The generation of locked-in trades by ACT enhances the overall efficiency of the clearance and settlement process
and virtually eliminates a member's risk exposure respecting uncompared trades. These benefits cannot be realized,
however, unless the broker-dealers on both sides of the trade have some form of participation in a registered clearing
agency.

The rule change will increase participation in registered clearing agencies due to the elimination of the ``25 mile
exception'' from Section 7(a) in Part V of Schedule D to the NASD By-Laws.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Prior to the amendment, the ``25 mile exception'' allowed market makers in SmallCap

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 securities, that did not participate in the Small Order Execution System'' SOES'') and were located more than 25 miles
from a clearing facility, to bypass the requirement of clearing and settling transactions through a registered clearing
agency. The rule, as amended, eliminates this exception and requires market makers in Nasdaq securities to utilize
the facilities of a registered clearing agency that uses a continuous net settlement system, unless both parties
to a transaction agree to settle the transaction ``exclearing.''

The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. As a result of the amendment, parallel requirements
will exist for the two largest equity market segments in which NASD members function as market makers and utilize ACT
for trade reporting and comparison purposes.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Sections 11A(a)(1), 15A(b)(6), and 17A(a)(1)
of the Act. Section 11A(a)(1) contains the Congressional findings that have guided development of the National Market
System. These findings include a directive to apply state-of-art data processing and communications techniques
to achieve more efficient and effective market operations and to ensure the economical execution of securities orders.
Similarly, Section 15A(b)(6) requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities association
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and
processing information with respect to, and facilitation transactions in securities. Finally, Section 17A(a)(1)
reflects the statutory goals of a national system for clearance and settlement of securities transactions. These
goals include the application of new data processing and communications techniques to create the opportunity for
more efficient, effective, and safe procedures for clearance and settlement.

clearing agency.

Description of Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx proposes to adopt Advice B&hyph;12, which would extend the prohibitions contained in Phlx Rule 1014 and Phlx
Advice B&hyph;4, regarding off-floor opening orders for options traded on multiple exchanges. Currently, Commentary
.14 to Phlx Rule 1014 and Phlx Advice B&hyph;4 prohibit a Registered Options Trader (``ROT'') from placing an opening
order for their market functions account from off-floor. The Phlx now seeks to restrict Phlx ROTs and specialists
from sending orders which would establish or increase a position in registered options to other exchanges from off
of the Phlx options trading floor. Before an opening order initiated from the Phlx equity options floor may be sent
to another market for execution, it must first clear the crowd at the Phlx when the bid or offer of the order is on or between
the Phlx disseminated market.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Pursuant to the proposal, ROTs and specialists would be required to place their off-floor opening positions in their
customer accounts, regardless of whether the execution of such orders occurs on the Phlx or on another exchange.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The fine schedule for proposed Advice B&hyph;12 would run on a three year cycle, such that repeat violations within
a three-year period would result in escalating fines.

executed, the order may be sent away.

The fine schedule for Advice B&hyph;12 provides that a fine of $500 will be imposed for the first violation and a fine
of $1,000 will be imposed for the second violation. The sanction for the third violation is discretionary with the
Phlx Business Conduct Committee. In addition, under a rolling three-year cycle, if three years elapse between the
first and second violation, the second violation would be treated as a first violation. If there is a violation within
the three years after the most recent violation, the next highest fine will be issued. Thus, a third violation less
than three years after a fine was issued for a second violation would be treated as a ``third violation,'' even though
more than three years may have elapsed after the first violation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CBOE believes that the Phlx proposal raises implications regarding the multiple listing of options which should
be dealt with on a uniform basis by the options exchanges.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the CBOE believes that the proposal would allow Phlx specialists and ROTs, who enter transactions
from the Phlx options floor, to obtain ``good faith'' margin treatment for options transactions executed on other
exchanges even if there is little or no activity in those options on the Phlx and the transactions have no relationship
to the specialists' and ROTs' performance at the Phlx. As a result, the CBOE believes that multiple listing could be
used as a means of giving the floor members of options exchanges preferred access to options traded on other exchanges
without regard to whether there is any meaningful competition in those options between the exchanges.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE suggests that specialists and ROTs should be required to effect a certain percentage (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 75%) of their contract volume in a class of options on the exchange on which they act as a specialist or ROT before being
entitled to effect transactions on other exchanges in that options class through their market functions accounts.

The CBOE acknowledges, however, that the proposal is a logical extension of the Phlx's existing rules because it accords
the same treatment to all transactions initiated from off the Phlx floor without regard to whether the transactions
are executed on the Phlx or another exchange. See CBOE Comment Letter,

Phlx Response
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx refutes the arguments raised by the CBOE.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The Phlx states that by seeking to ensure that Phlx floor traders conduct their market making functions from the Phlx
equity options floor where they can best meet their affirmative and negative market making obligations, the proposal
merely brings the Phlx's rules into line with the existing rules of the other options exchanges, including the CBOE's.
As a result, the Phlx contends that the proposal does not raise the implications contemplated by the CBOE of ``disparate,
competitive treatment by the different options exchanges.''

Additionally, the Phlx argues that it has rules in place addressing the competitive concerns raised by the CBOE. Pursuant
to Phlx Advice B&hyph;3, ROTs are required to trade in person, and not through the use of orders, the greater of 1,000
contracts or 50% of their contract volume on the Exchange in each quarter.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Additionally, at least 50% of a ROT's trading activity in each quarter must be in assigned options classes. Proposed
Advice B&hyph;12 does not alter the application of Advice B&hyph;3. As a result, the Phlx argues that specialists
and ROTs would not be able to obtain good faith margin treatment for a significant number of transactions executed
on other markets relative to the number of trades that they must execute on the Phlx equity options floor, regardless
of the level of trading activity in their assigned options classes at the Phlx.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5)
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 in that the proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, promote just and equitable
principles of trade, and to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the Commission finds that the
proposal is a reasonable extension of the Phlx's existing rules by according the same treatment to all transactions
initiated from off the Phlx floor, without regard to whether the transactions are executed on the Phlx or another exchange.
The Commission agrees with the Exchange that this restriction should serve to ensure that Phlx floor traders are conducting
their market making activities from on the floor where they can best meet their affirmative and negative market making
obligations.

The Commission appreciates the concerns raised by the CBOE; however, the Commission believes that the Phlx has adequate
rules and procedures to ensure that Exchange ROTs and specialists can obtain market-maker treatment for options
trades executed on other exchanges only where they perform a real market-making function for such options on the Phlx
floor. First, under Section 11(b) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Rule 11b&hyph;1 thereunder
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 and Phlx Rule 1014, specialists and ROTs are required to engage in a course of dealings in a manner reasonably calculated
to contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market. This ensures that trades by such persons are for the purposes
of fulfilling market-making obligations under the Act. Secondly, Exchange Advice B&hyph;3 minimizes the opportunity
for ROTs to obtain good faith margin for a significant number of trades executed on other exchanges. By requiring that
the greater of 1,000 contracts or 50% of their contract volume be executed on the Exchange in each quarter
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 and that at least 50% of their contract volume be in assigned classes in each quarter. Advice B&hyph;3 effectively
ensures that market-makers will not be able to use the Phlx floor simply to send orders to other markets but instead
will have substantive obligations that ensure they are acting as a bona fide market-maker.

CBOE Rule 8.7, Interpretation and Policy .03, is quite similar to Phlx Advice B&hyph;3. This CBOE rule requires that
(1) ``at least 75 percent of a Market-Maker's total contract volume must be in option classes to which he has been appointed
pursuant to [CBOE] Rule 8.3;'' and (2) ``a Market-Maker must execute in person, and not through the use of orders, at
least 25 percent of his total transactions.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the Commission notes that only market makers who are conducting bona fide market making activity on the
Phlx floor are entitled to good faith margin treatment for their options transactions. As a result of the above, the
Commission does not believe that the current proposal would result in disparate, competitive treatment by the options
exchange, as envisioned by the CBOE.

Indeed, the Commission believes that approval of the proposed rule change makes the situation envisioned by the CBOE
less likely by removing the ambiguity that currently exists in the Phlx's rules and clarifying that off-floor orders,
whether executed on the Phlx floor or at another exchange, are not entitled to good faith margin treatment.

II. Description of the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx is amending Regulation 4 of the Exchange's order and decorum regulations,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 which were adopted pursuant to Phlx Rule 60 (``Assessments for Breach of Regulations'').
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Regulation 4, Paragraph (i) (redesignated Paragraph (a)) currently prohibits members/participants or employees
of a member/participant from engaging in disorderly conduct on the trading floor, and imposes fines for violations
thereof. In addition to a general prohibition against disorderly conduct in Paragraph (a), Subparagraphs (ii) through
(iv) currently impose specific fines for abuse of the paging system, possession of firearms, and various degrees
of fighting, including inciting physical abuse, minor acts of physical abuse and major acts of physical abuse.

In addition to Regulation 4, the Exchange's Rule 60 Regulations govern smoking; food, liquids, and beverages; identification
badges and access cards; visitors and applicants; dress; and proper utilization of the security system. See Phlx
Rule 60 Regulations.

Rule 60 permits Exchange officials and floor officials to assess fines, not exceeding $1,000, for violations of regulations
pertaining to order, decorum, health, safety and welfare (``order and decorum'') on the Exchange, or to refer such
violations to the Exchange's Business Conduct Committee where higher fines or other sanctions may be imposed, in
accordance with Phlx Rule 960. Rule 60 also enumerates the procedural aspects of order and decorum fines, including
the ability to contest a fine and request a hearing. The Exchange has adopted seven regulations of order and decorum
pursuant to Rule 60, including Regulation 4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx is amending Regulation 4, Paragraph (a) to prohibit indecorous conduct on the trading floor which is disruptive
to the conduct of business on the floor. The Exchange is also adopting Sub-Paragraph (iv) to Regulation 4 to impose
a fine ranging from $500 to $1,000 for abusive, derisive or harassing treatment directed at any person while on the
floor, which, in the view of two floor officials, could constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Exchange is adopting Paragraph (b) to Regulation 4 stating that any acts described in paragraph (a) which
are deemed particularly egregious, or where an individual has established a pattern of order violations, may be referred
by two floor officials to the Business Conduct Committee where additional fines and other sanctions may be imposed
pursuant to Phlx Rule 960. As a result of this adopted language, similar language which currently follows the paragraph
addressing physical abuse in Regulation 4 is being deleted to apply the new paragraph to all violations of Regulation
4.

The Exchange believes that the amendment is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with
Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and protect investors and
the public interested by ensuring an orderly and decorous environment on the trading floor for Exchange business
to be conducted. The proposal is also consistent with Section 5(b)(6), in that Regulation 4, as amended, would continue
to provide that members of the Exchange be appropriately disciplined for violations of the rules of the Exchange.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with the requirements
of Sections 6(b)(5), (6) and (7) of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the Phlx's amendments are a reasonable measure which should help to ensure the orderly
operation of the Exchange floor. The proposal addresses the operational concerns by explicitly prohibiting indecorous
conduct that is disruptive to business on the Exchange's trading floor. The Commission believes that the amendment
to Regulation 4 should contribute to the Phlx's efforts to ensure the efficient, undisrupted conduct of business
on the Exchange and provide a trading floor environment free from conduct that could distract or interfere with market
activity. As a result, the rule change should enhance the members' ability to engage in transactions in securities
and, thereby, protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the proposed amendments provide appropriate penalties for violations of Regulation
4. Specifically, the adopted range of fines ($500 to $1,000) that can be imposed for abusive, derisive or harassing
conduct on the floor which is determined by two floor officials to constitute a public embarrassment to the Exchange
is reasonable in relation to the infractions in question because of the Phlx's interest in ensuring the safety of its
floor personnel and the undisrupted conduct of business on the Exchange. Moreover, because the rule change defines
the scope of prohibited conduct, provides notice to members, provides a right of appeal, and is tailored to serve a
legitimate Exchange regulatory interest to ensure that trading can continue undisrupted on the Phlx floor, the proposal
provides fair and reasonable procedures for the regulation of trading floor conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also believes that it is appropriate for the Exchange to retain discretion to pursue formal disciplinary
proceedings in accordance with Phlx Rule 960 for egregious violations or where an individual has established a pattern
of order violations. This will enable the Exchange to seek stiffer sanctions where warranted by the scope and nature
of the violative conduct. The Commission, however, emphasizes that when an Exchange investigation results in a full
disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 960, all procedural rights provided in the Rule would apply.

the same conduct. The Exchange also stated that if a disciplinary proceeding pursuant to Rule 960 is initiated by the
Exchange, all procedural rights contained in Rule 960 would apply. Conversation between Gerald D. O'Connell, Vice

 notice is hereby given that on July 14, 1994, the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (``Philadep'') and the Stock

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule changes respectively amend Philadep By-Laws Article IV, Section 2 and Article III, Section 4 and

of the Boards of Directors and Nominating Committees.

In their filings with the Commission, Philadep and SCCP included statements concerning the purpose of and the basis
for the proposed rule changes and discussed any comments received on the proposed rule changes. The text of these statements
may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. Philadep and SCCP have prepared summaries, as set forth in
sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of these statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to ease the administrative burden, Philadep and SCCP propose to amend their By-Laws to remove the requirement
that the two Vice Chairmen of the Board of Governors of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio
members of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors. The proposed amendments will install the Chief Operating Officer
of the PHLX both as an ex-officio member of the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors and as the Vice Chairman of the Philadep
and SCCP Boards. The proposed amendments will reduce the requisite number of PHLX Governors who must serve on the Philadep
and SCCP Boards of Directors from a majority of the fifteen to seventeen Directors to six of the Directors. The proposed
amendments will change the term of office for the Boards of Directors for the purpose of qualifying PHLX Governors
as Philadep and SCCP Directors.

The intent of this provision is to synchronize the term of office for the Chairman of the Exchange's Board of Governors
with his terms of office on the Philadep and SCCP Boards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Presently, under Article III Section 4(a) of the Philadep and SCCP By-Laws, the Nominating Committee must consist
of five ex-officio members of the Board of Directors and two other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board. Under
the proposed rule change, the number of members on the Nominating Committee will consist of four ex-officio members
of the Board of Directors and three other persons appointed by the Chairman of the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As composed under the proposed rule changes, the Philadep and SCCP Boards of Directors will continue to provide the
PHLX, as the sole shareholder of both Philadep and SCCP, with adequate representation. The PHLX will be represented
by both senior exchange staff personnel and members of the PHLX Board of Governors, who typically also represent Philadep
and SCCP participant firms. In accordance with Philadep's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article
XI, the Chairman of the PHLX Board of Governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed
a unanimous consent in lieu of a special meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule changes comply with Section 17A of the Act insofar as they will aid Philadep and SCCP in assuring the
fair representation of shareholders and participants in the selection of directors and in the administration of
affairs.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Securities markets are becoming increasingly international, reacting to many of the same economic and political
events that affect the rest of the world. The globalization of these markets is driven by several factors, but advances
in automation and telecommunications have propelled its rapid growth. Factors driving this globalization include
investors' desire to enter foreign markets, the growth of large institutional funds needing to decrease risk by diversifying
investments in other countries, and regulatory changes that opened markets to foreign broker-dealer firms and their
customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective international securities markets require efficient and valuable systems for order routing and execution,
information dissemination, and clearance and settlement. Most major and emerging markets have automated or plan
to automate all or some of these functions to take advantage of efficiency, competition and market expansion opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25284 stated that the international securities market should
feature efficient structures for quotation, price and volume dissemination concerning securities and derivatives
markets traded worldwide.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 A critical step in achieving a worldwide securities market information system would be the creation and maintenance
of international linkages between the automated information systems of the various national securities markets.
Such a link was established between the BSE and the ME in 1984 for orders in U.S. stocks transmitted southbound from
Montreal to Boston. This rule proposal is designed to complete the ``loop'' with orders in Canadian stocks being routed
northbound from Boston to Montreal.

The proposed rule change seeks to commence northbound trading pursuant to the trading linkage previously established
with the ME.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 This would provide an additional means for U.S. customers to place orders in Canadian stocks with U.S. brokers for
execution on the ME. These orders would be entered into the broker/dealers' order-match systems which are linked
to the BSE's BEACON system. BEACON would receive and log the details of the order and pass it on to the ME's automated
order-routing and execution system. The order would contain the terms for the price, if any, stated in Canadian dollars,
and an identifier indicating that its transmission is for the ME. The ME system would also log the order and direct it
to the specialist's electronic book for action. These orders will be treated as would any other order sent to the ME
floor.

Upon execution, the customer report would be sent from the specialist's book through the ME system to the BEACON system,
with both systems logging in the details of the report, then to the broker/dealer's order-match system. BEACON will
essentially function as a conduit for the benefit of member firms who today conduct this business through correspondents.
While BEACON will keep detailed records of all traffic, it will not function as an execution system for Canadian stocks,
nor show quotes in Canadian stocks, and it will not be advertised as such.

The trades would be cleared pursuant to the BSE member's agreement with a Canadian correspondent to clear and settle
trades at the Canadian Depository for Securities (``CDS'') on their behalf. BSE members would give up a valid CDS account
at execution and would be treated like a customer of the Canadian correspondent. This is the clearing arrangement
that U.S. broker/dealers currently utilize in clearing trades in Canadian stocks.

 This structure will enhance the level of cooperation between the BSE and ME surveillance departments with regard
to transactions executed through the link, as is currently done today with southbound orders. Essentially, each
northbound trade will be entered into the ME's electronic book and will therefore be subject to the ME's on-line stock
trading monitoring system (``SECMA''). The ME currently focuses its trading reviews on insider trading, trading
on non-public market information (``front running''), price manipulation (Market fraud of various types), short
squeeze, short sales down ticking, normal course issue of bid up ticking, and restrictions on trading by members involved
in a distribution.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis under the Act for the proposed rule change is Section 6(b)(5) in that the rule is designed to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and
coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to,
and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market, and in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers, or dealers.

(a) Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to achieve a certain degree of transparency in the municipal securities
market in a cost-effective manner by collecting and disseminating information on inter-dealer transactions. Under
the proposed rule change, aggregate data about market activity and certain volume and price information about frequently
traded securities would be disseminated to promote investor confidence in the market and its pricing mechanisms.
In addition, all transaction information collected would be made available to regulatory agencies responsible
for enforcement of Board rules as a means to assist in the inspection for compliance with, and the enforcement of, Board
rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is a first step to increase transparency in the municipal securities market. After gaining
experience with the collection and dissemination of inter-dealer transactions, the Board's future steps would
include adding institutional and retail customer information, and moving toward the ultimate goal of making available
transaction information that is both comprehensive and contemporaneous.

Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The municipal securities market has grown dramatically in recent years. At the same time, retail investors have entered
the market in increasing numbers. These factors have increased the need for access to information on municipal securities
trading in the market, including information which may help to establish more accurate valuation of individual municipal
securities.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Recognizing this need, the Board has adopted long-term goals and priorities for action, among which is the goal of
providing market participants with more information about the value of securities.

The Pilot Program for Transaction Reporting.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1993, the Board announced its plan to undertake a pilot program to collect and publish information on transactions
occurring in the inter-dealer market for municipal securities (the ``pilot program''). The Board has designed the
pilot program to take into account the distinctive aspects of the municipal securities market that distinguish it
from the exchange-listed and Nasdaq markets. A primary distinguishing characteristic of the municipal securities
market is the large number of outstanding issues. There are approximately 1.2 million municipal securities that
are distinct, non-fungible entities for purposes of trading and reporting. In addition, the municipal securities
market lacks any core group of issues that trade frequently and consistently over sustained periods of time. While,
on any given day, a certain number of municipal securities are traded frequently, the identity of these frequently
traded issues is continually changing over time. A third distinguishing characteristic is that, in the municipal
securities market, most issues are purchased by ``buy and hold'' investors relatively quickly after initial issuance.
When frequent trading does occur in an issue, it generally occurs immediately after issuance and then subsides within
a week to 10 days.

The Board has examined inter-dealer trading data provided by the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')
for a six-month period during 1991. During this six-month period, only 40 issues traded three or more times per day
for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. It is important to note that these 40 issues did not trade frequently
for the entire six-month period and that, on any given day, only a few of the 40 would be trading frequently. In most cases,
frequent trading in these issues_primarily new issues_tended to trail off shortly after a 10-day run. Altogether,
approximately 75 percent of all issues trading during the six-month period were traded only once or twice in a given
week.

In the markets covered by Nasdaq and the National Association of Securities Dealer's (``NASD's'') recently inaugurated
Fixed Income Pricing System (``FIPS'') for high-yield fixed-income corporate securities,
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 displays of data about a security are organized based on firm quotations. The Board believes that a different concept
is needed for municipal securities, since firm two-sided quotations exist only for very few municipal securities
at any given time. There are several reasons for this. For most municipal securities, there is only a small ``float''
of securities available to be the subject of trading. This small ``float'' is a primary disincentive to market making.
In addition, the tax treatment of borrowing tax-exempt securities (along with the small floats) effectively prevents
short-sales of an issue. This denies potential market makers a technique that otherwise could be used to manage risks.
Finally, the traditional ``buy and hold'' philosophy of most tax-exempt purchasers simply does to provide the incentive
or create the need for continuous, two-sided quotations traditionally offered by market makers in equity securities.

The Board has designed the transaction reporting pilot program to provide the public with price and volume information
in a way that reflects the unique aspects of the municipal securities market. The pilot program will make information
available in the form of a daily, public report containing volume and pricing information for the inter-dealer market
(``daily report''). The issues that will be reported individually each day will be those that traded at or above a threshold
number of times on the previous business day. Initially the threshold will be four trades per day. As trading in an issue
increases, it will be reported; as an issue's trading frequency decreases, it will be replaced by others that are trading
frequently. In this way, the daily report will reflect the ever-changing pattern of trading activity in the universe
of some 1.2 million municipal securities. The pilot program will make information on all inter-dealer trades in municipal
securities available to the Commission and other regulatory agencies to assist in the inspection for compliance
with and the enforcement of Board rules.

Requirement to Report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is currently no affirmative requirement for public reporting of transactions in municipal securities. In
its present form, the Board's rule G&hyph;14 does not require the reporting of transactions in municipal securities,
but does require that any such report represent a legitimate trade. The rule requires a dealer that distributes or
publishes a report of a transaction in a municipal security to know or have reason to believe that the transaction was
actually effected and to have no reason to believe that the transaction was fictitious or in furtherance of any fraudulent,
misleading or deceptive purpose.

The proposed rule change would impose a duty upon dealers to report inter-dealer transaction information to the Board
or its designee. It states that such information would be used to make public reports and would be provided to the Commission,
the NASD, and bank regulatory organizations charged with enforcing Board rules, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.

, the Comptroller of the Currency in the case of national banks, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
in the case of state member banks of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'')
in the case of other banks insured by the FDIC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers would report transactions under Rule G&hyph;14 Transaction
Reporting Procedures, which are also part of the proposed rule change. The transaction reporting procedures designate
the NSCC as the Board's agent to receive transaction information. NSCC is a clearing agency registered with the Commission
under Section 17A of the Act and is the central facility for automated comparison processing for inter-dealer municipal
securities transactions. Automated comparison is the process by which each party to an inter-dealer trade ensures
that its contra-party knows the terms of the trade and will be ready to settle, on those terms, on settlement date. In
general, the automated comparison process requires each dealer in a transaction to submit information on a trade
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, price, quantity, contra-party) to a comparison system operated by a clearing agency registered with the Commission.
This information is then matched (``compared'') by computer in the comparison system and the results reported back
to each dealer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, pursuant to the Board's rule G&hyph;12(f)(i), dealers must use the facilities of a registered clearing
agency to compare all inter-dealer transactions in securities with CUSIP numbers. Since NSCC and all other registered
clearing agencies offering municipal securities comparison services are linked by automated interfaces, it will
be possible for transactions to be submitted to NSCC by submitting them to any such clearing agency. Accordingly,
the proposed procedures state that dealers may provide transaction information to NSCC or any other registered clearing
agency linked with NSCC for the purpose of automated comparison. Dealers may submit transaction information directly
or through an agent that is a member of the registered clearing agency.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, under the proposed rule change, dealers would not be required to submit transaction data to a separate reporting
system and should not incur additional operational costs to fulfill their reporting obligations.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With one exception, NSCC automated comparison procedures require both the purchasing and selling dealers to submit
information about the trade. Thus, the proposed reporting procedures require transaction information to be submitted
by both parties. For transactions involving the distribution of new issue securities from a syndicate manager to
syndicate members, however, NSCC comparison procedures require only a submission from the syndicate manager. The
proposed procedures allow for the same ``one-sided'' submission of information for public reporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comparison process requires various data elements to be submitted with regard to each transaction. The proposed
transaction reporting program makes an identical requirement for these data items. The following transaction information
will be collected by the Board through NSCC:

As noted above, dealers already are required to provide this information to a registered clearing agency as part of
the automated comparison process required under rule G&hyph;12(f)(i). Currently, the accrued interest is an optional
data element for the purpose of the automated comparison process,

ie., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Timing. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the current comparison cycle, dealers submit required information to a registered clearing agency by the evening
of trade date (``T''). NSCC, as the central facilities provider for the comparison system, accepts this submitted
data, compares the submissions of the parties on the night of T and reports the results back to the dealers on T+1. Trades
that are successfully compared on T will be the basis of the daily report produced by the Board's proposed program.
Accordingly, trades that are not successfully compared on the night of the trade will not be subject to reporting on
T+1.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 As an indication of the reliability of the data in the daily report, the percentage of submissions that were successfully
compared (``comparison rate'') will be shown in each day's report.

It was determined to use data for compared trades rather than data for both compared and uncompared trades because
the compared data is more reliable than uncompared data. If uncompared data were reported, this might cause the daily
report to include erroneous prices or to include duplicate trades. Uncompared submissions eventually are resolved
as trades or as mistakes. Those that are resolved as trades will be entered in the transaction reporting database after
T+1 and thus will be made available to the enforcement agencies.

 the number of different CUSIP numbers that were involved in compared transactions on that day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the aggregate data, the daily report will contain price and volume information about certain municipal
securities that were ``frequently traded'' on that day. The Board believes that it would be appropriate to report
issue-specific information only if four or more transactions in the issue are reported as compared on a given day.
Using this threshold and based on recent levels of market activity, the Board anticipates that the daily list of frequently
traded issues normally will range between 80 to 350 issues, with an average of about 180 issues each day. The size and
composition of the list obviously would vary from day to day, depending upon market activity in specific cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information in the daily report about each ``frequently traded'' security will include:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The CUSIP number and security's description;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The total number of transactions in the security and total volume traded;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The highest and lowest prices of transactions in the security; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) ``Average price'' information, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the number of transactions in the security involving par values between $100,000 and $1,000,000 inclusive, and
the average price of those transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board will provide a statement to be included in the report pointing out that (a) the daily report represents only
those inter-dealer transactions that have been submitted for comparison and that actually were compared on the previous
day and (b) reported prices are affected by various factors such as transaction size. This statement is intended to
ensure that readers unfamiliar with the municipal securities market do not misinterpret the daily report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Price Computation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Municipal securities transactions are sometimes executed on a dollar price basis and sometimes executed on a yield
basis. The Board has chosen to use dollar price as the uniform expression of ``price'' in the daily report to simplify
reporting procedures. In cases where dollar price is submitted for comparison, that dollar price, as compared by
the comparison system, will be used in the daily report. In certain cases the security ``price'' for the daily report
will need to be computed from other submitted data. For example, current procedures required for automated comparison
allow the submission of par value and ``final money'' (total dollar amount of the transaction) to achieve comparison.
The proposed Rule G&hyph;14 Transaction Reporting Procedures provide that the dealers will submit the amount of
accrued interest in the trade to allow for computation of dollar price in these cases. The following formula will be
used:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 -->
Dollar price = (Final money_Accrued interest) / Par value
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For ``when, as if issued'' trades submitted for comparison on a yield basis, final money will be computed and a dollar
price similarly derived if a settlement date is known. For yield transactions whose settlement date is not known,
an assumed settlement date will be used. The assumed settlement date will be 20 business days from the first trade date
on which that issue is submitted for comparison. On the daily report, a note will be added to the trade information stating
that an assumed settlement date was used to compute the dollar price in the trade and showing the date used. Once the
actual settlement date is known to NSCC, it will be used and noted as such when the issue is next included on a daily report.

Surveillance and Enforcement Uses of Pilot Program Information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to public reporting, the proposed rule change would make transaction data available to the regulatory
organizations charged with enforcing Board rules. Commenting on the need for better information in this area, the
Commission's staff stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Staff's view, a central flaw in the present regulatory system is the lack of an integrated audit trail in the municipal
securities market of the type that exists in the stock and options markets. Because of the limited pricing information
available in the secondary market for many thinly traded municipal securities, it is extremely difficult for the
NASD to assess the fairness of the prices being charged retail customers by municipal securities broker-dealers.
The Staff believes that the MSRB, the NASD, and the banking agencies should work to create a cost-effective trade reporting
system that will provide the regulators with an integrated audit trail of municipal securities and result in improved
surveillance for all segments of the market. The development of such an audit trail would increase the NASD's ability
to examine and enforce the existing customer protection rules of the Commission and the NASD.

The transaction reporting pilot program will result in a centralized data base of trade information that is expected
to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of inspection for compliance with and the enforcement of Board rules.
All compared trades will be made available to these regulatory organizations, including those that compare after
trade date and those not frequently traded. Comprehensive information will be made available, including identification
of parties to each trade and the prices of all securities traded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information to be made available through the pilot program will enable enforcement agencies to identify transaction
patterns to detect market manipulation and other anomalies. It will also assist regulators in determining the market
value of securities as they assess compliance with the Board's rule G&hyph;30 on fair and reasonable prices and commissions.
The Board is working with the NASD and the bank regulatory organizations to ensure that the pilot system's outputs
will meet their requirements for surveillance of the municipal securities market and enforcement of the Board's
rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board plans to evaluate expansion of the pilot program as experience is gained and comments on program operations
are received from information users and the industry. The Board's first consideration will be how the daily report
and surveillance mechanisms could be improved by including institutional customer transaction data and information
on the time of trade. During this evaluation, the Board's goal will be not only to enhance the information contained
in the daily report, but also to find cost-effective methods for providing even greater levels of transparency to
the market, particularly with respect to customer transactions and the dissemination of transaction price information
on a more contemporaneous basis.

Effect of Proposed Rule Change upon Dealers.

 Dealers should experience minimal operational impact from the proposed rule change, since, as mentioned above,
they are now required, pursuant to the Board's rule G&hyph;12(f)(i), to use the facilities of a registered clearing
agency for the automated comparison of transactions. The transaction data submitted by dealers for comparison will
be used by the transaction reporting pilot program. Thus, under the proposed program, dealers would not have to submit
transaction data to a separate reporting system and should not incur additional operational costs.

or Others
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In May 1993 the Board published a notice explaining its plan to collect inter-dealer transaction data by using information
required for automated comparison, clearance and settlement. The notice set forth the proposed method of collection
inter-dealer transaction data and of publishing it. The Board received four comments of which two supported the proposed
pilot program and made suggestions for expansion. The remaining two commenters suggested certain modifications
of the daily report format and the selection criteria for reported issues without expressing general support or opposition.

Sample Format for Daily Report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter noted that the reporting of transaction data by the Board should include a statement stating that prices
change with market conditions and that prices for individual transactions may depend upon factors such as size of
transaction, interest rate, maturity date, and call features. Another commenter stated that the daily report should
note that the data represents transactions that have been submitted for comparison. The Board agrees that statements
similar to those requested by the commenters should be included on or with the daily reports to help clarify the meaning
of the data to the general public and has decided to include such statements on the daily report. The Board also plans
to ask recipients of the daily report who intend to publish it for a general audience also to include such statements
in their publications.

Average Price Calculation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested widening the band used for average price calculation to include more price information.
In contrast, another commenter suggested narrowing the band to exclude some trades that might be considered ``odd
lots'' (certain zero-coupon bond trades reported by NSCC on the basis of maturity value).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that it is appropriate to use the band from $100,000 to $1 million for average price calculations
for initial production of the daily report. Once the program goes into operation and feedback is received from data
users, it will be possible to judge how well the ``average price'' concept actually works in practice. As experience
is gained, the price band concept will be reviewed to determine whether it is serving its intended purpose of indicating
a ``typical'' inter-dealer market price. The pilot program's computer system will be designed to enable the parameters
of the price band to be changed easily and quickly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compilations of Data.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter urged the Board to provide compilations of transaction data (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a month of data on a computer disk) to facilitate study of the data by academics. The Board has decided not to make such
compilations available at the beginning of the pilot program, but may do so in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Information on Daily Reports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that the Board publish individual transaction data (CUSIP number, description, par value,
price) for each transaction, without regard to whether a security is being frequently traded on a specific day. This
commenter believes that, by limiting reporting to individual maturities of an issue that are trading frequently,
the program would withhold information that, in the aggregate, would be useful. For example, the commenter believes
that the general price levels for prerefunded securities could be extracted from aggregate transaction data on prerefunded
securities, even when no one prerefunded security is trading frequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes that reporting an isolated transaction in a security does not necessarily provide a reliable indicator
of ``market price'' and might be misleading to an observer not familiar with the market. Nevertheless, after the pilot
program begins operation and experience is obtained, the Board will review the use of the daily report and consider
expanding the information included to accommodate requests from information users and the industry.

As currently proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE between the inside spread on Nasdaq, a subsequent limit
order on the opposite side of the market priced at the same or a superior price to the limit price of the pending limit
order (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a sell limit order priced at or below a limit order to buy) will be matched against that pending limit order. If the incoming
limit order is unpreferenced, all market makers at the inside quotation will have a 15-second opportunity to execute
the incoming limit order. If the incoming limit order is preferenced, only the preferenced market maker will have
a 15-second opportunity to execute the incoming limit order. If no market maker elects to execute the incoming limit
order, the system would automatically execute the pending limit order against the incoming limit order.

For example, if the inside bid and offer were 20_201/2, and two limit orders were entered to buy and sell at 201/4, the
system would allow the orders to match against each other within 15 seconds. In addition, if two limit orders crossed
each other in between the inside spread (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, a buy order priced at 203/8 and a sell order priced at 201/8), the orders would be matched after 15 seconds and the price
averaged between the orders (each would receive 201/4).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment will change the execution methodology for matched limit orders by eliminating the 15 second window
for the display of the incoming limit order prior to execution and permitting an immediate match of offsetting limit
orders received by NPROVE. By providing retail customers a greater opportunity to receive immediate and automatic
executions of their limit orders priced between the spread, the NASD believes the proposal will enhance NPROVE's
price improvement capabilities and limit order protection features. Moreover, to the extent the NPROVE has received
two priced orders from retail customers that match or cross each other inside the spread, the NASD believes no market
benefit would be served by delaying the execution of this transaction. Indeed, the NASD believes the amendment is
in furtherance of Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(v) of the Act, which provides that investors' orders should be executed without
the intervention of a dealer to the maximum extent possible consistent with the achievement of other critical market
structure objectives, such as the economically efficient execution of securities transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed execution algorithm for matching incoming market orders against limit orders priced better than the
inside market will remain the same. Specifically, as proposed, if a limit order is entered into NPROVE at a price between
the spread, the next incoming market order on the opposite side of the market (e.g., the limit order is to sell stock
and the market order is to buy stock) would automatically ``pass over'' or read the limit order file to see if there are
any orders residing in the limit order file at prices superior to the best bid or offer in the Nasdaq marketplace. If
a limit order resides on the file at a superior price, then the market order will be flashed on the screen at that superior
price for acceptance within a brief 15-second period, instead of at the inside bid or offer, as the case may be. In that
event, all market makers at the inside quotation would have the opportunity for 15 seconds to execute the market order
at the superior limit price. If no market maker elected to execute the order at that improved price, the system would
execute the orders against each other at the limit price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD notes that both the limit order and the market order are better off with this execution process_customers
placing market orders receive price improvement and customers placing limit orders will be assured that NPROVE executions
will not occur at prices inferior to their limit order prices. Accordingly, the NASD believes this execution process
for a market orders is wholly consistent with the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A key consideration for retaining NPROVE's flash display and automated execution feature for market orders is the
need to maintain the liquidity and depth of The Nasdaq Stock Market. One of the cornerstones of the success of Nasdaq's
competing dealer system has been the availability of market maker capital to satisfy investors' liquidity demands.
The extent to which market maker capital is available, in turn, is critically dependent on the ability of market makers
to interact with customer order flow. Without the ability of market makers to trade with their customers' orders,
orders presented to them by other members, or orders entered into Nasdaq execution systems, market-maker profitability
will suffer and, as a result, market liquidity will diminish and investors will receive inferior executions of their
orders. Accordingly, if market makers are denied any opportunity, however brief, to interact with incoming market
orders entered into NPROVE, the NASD believes that liquidity on Nasdaq will inevitably be affected in an adverse manner
to the detriment of investors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD notes that an objective for a National Market System contained in Section 11A of the Act regarding the execution
of investors' orders without the intervention of a dealer is premised upon, and necessarily incorporates the corresponding
assurance that, such executions will be fully consistent with the economically efficient execution of such securities
transactions. The NASD maintains that affording market makers an extremely narrow 15-second window of exposure
within which they may view, evaluate, and respond to incoming market orders prior to the automated match of two investors'
orders is appropriate in a competing dealer market environment. The ability of market makers to interact with customer
order flow is essential to the long-term well-being of Nasdaq and the efficient execution of customer orders that
results from vigorous competition among viable, aggressive Nasdaq market makers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In sum, the NASD believes the proposal significantly enhances the price improvement and limit order protection features
of NPROVE and eliminates the possibility that a pending limit order will remain unexecuted while other public customer
orders receive executions at the order's limit price, while preserving the liquidity and orderliness of Nasdaq by
allowing a minimal, yet essential, opportunity for market makers to interact with retail order flow.

PROVE system is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. Section
15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions
in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system
and in general to protect investors and the public interest. Section 15A(b)(9) requires that rules of an Association
not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. Section
15A(b)(11) requires the NASD to formulate rules governing the quality of fair and informative quotations. Section
11A(a)(1)(C) finds that it is in the public interest to, among other things, assure economically efficient execution
of securities transactions. The fundamental purpose of N

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PROVE is not anti-competitive as it affords all market and limit orders an equal opportunity for price improvement
regardless of whether the orders are preferenced or unpreferenced. In addition, to the extent that preferenced orders
may be handled differently than unpreferenced orders, because market makers have entered into preferencing arrangements
with known customers, market maker's effectively will have waived the protections offered them by the system. N

priority and continue to receive unpreferenced order flow through N

The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is a recently-formed Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGIC Holdings, Inc. (``FGIC
Holdings''). FGIC Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation (``GE Capital''), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Company. FGIC Holdings is a holding company engaged primarily in the
insurance business through its subsidiary, Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. GE Capital is a diversified financial
services company. GE Capital's activities consist of several distinct businesses that fall into five industry segments:
specialized financing, mid-market financing, consumer services, equipment management, and specialty insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicant was formed for the primary purpose of issuing and selling in private placement transactions municipal
reinvestment contracts (``MRCs'') and similar investment agreements primarily to state or local government entities
or agencies. Applicant also sells put options where the holder acquires securities permitted under rule 3a&hyph;5(a)(6)
directly for its own account and applicant agrees, at the option of the holder, to purchase such investments at a later
date.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Within six months of applicant's receipt of the proceeds of the MRC offerings and put fees, applicant lends at least
85% of such proceeds to GE Capital or certain companies controlled by GE Capital (the ``Subsidiaries'') for their
use in financing their respective operations.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 GE Capital fully guarantees applicant's obligations under each MRC it issues.

Applicant considers the sale of put options to constitute the sale of debt securities and proceeds of the put options
to consist of the put fees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
All references herein to the Subsidiaries are intended to include solely companies that are controlled by GE Capital
under the definition of a ``company controlled by a parent company'' under rule 3a&hyph;5(b)(3).

3. Section 3(a)(1) defines an investment company to include any issuer that is engaged primarily, or that proposes
to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(3) defines
an investment company to include any issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding,
or trading in securities, and that owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40%
of the issuer's total assets, exclusive of Government securities and cash items, on an unconsolidated basis. Because
applicant's loans to GE Capital and the Subsidiaries may be considered investments in the debt securities of GE Capital
and the Subsidiaries, applicant falls within the definition of investment company.

4. To date, applicant has relied on the exception provided under section 3(c)(1) to avoid having to register as an investment
company.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The number of holders of MRCs is anticipated eventually to exceed 100. At that time, applicant will be unable to continue
to rely on section 3(c)(1). Accordingly, applicant requests an exemption from paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), and (b)
of rule 3a&hyph;5 so that it can issue debt securities in the manner described above without registering as an investment
company under the Act.

Applicant's Legal Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Rule 3a&hyph;5 excepts from the definition of investment company any finance subsidiary of an operating company.
Paragraph (a)(5) of rule 3a&hyph;5 requires that a finance subsidiary relying on the rule loan to its parent company
or a company controlled by its parent company at least 85% of amounts raised by the subsidiary. Paragraph (a)(6) limits
the investments of the finance subsidiary to Government securities, securities of its parent company or a company
controlled by its parent company, and certain other debt instruments. Rule 3a&hyph;5(b) defines a parent company
and conpanies controlled by the parent company as companies that are not investment companies under section 3(a)
or that are excepted or exempted by order from the definition of investment company by section 3(b) or by the rules and
regulations under section 3(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Assuming that GE Capital otherwise may be deemed to be an investment company under the Act, the diversity of GE Capital's
financial activities requires it to rely on the exception from the definition of investment company under section
3(c)(6).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Because GE Capital is excepted from the definition of investment company under section 3(c)(6), rather than under
section 3(b) or the rules and regulations under section 3(a), GE Capital is not an eligible parent within the meaning
of rule 3a&hyph;5(b). Consequently, applicant cannot comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a)(5) and (a)(6)
that it invest its assets in the securities of an eligible parent company and companies controlled by the parent company.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(c)(6) excepts from the definition of investment company any company primarily engaged in one or more of
the businesses described in paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) of section 3(c), or in one or more of such businesses (from
which not less than 25% of such company's gross income during its last fiscal year was derived) together with an additional
business or businesses other than investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading securities. Section 3(c)(3)
excepts from the definition of investment company banks and similar institutions. Section 3(c)(4) excepts from
the definition of investment company person engaged in the business of making small loans, industrial banking, or
similar businesses. Section 3(c)(5) excepts from the definition of investment company persons who are engaged in
the business of: ``purchasing or otherwise acquiring notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and
other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services; (B) making
loans to manufacturers, wholesales, and retailers of, and to prospective purchasers of, specified merchandise,
insurance, and services; and (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in
real estate.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Section 6(c) provides that the Commission may exempt any person or transaction from any provision of the Act or any
rule thereunder to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicant
asserts that none of the investor protection concerns addressed by the Act are raised by its activities since it is
engaged primarily in the business of financing the operations of GE Capital, and GE Capital is not an investment company.
Consequently, applicant believes that the standards for relief under section 6(c) are satisfied.

<DOCTITLE>Latin American Resources, Inc.; Order of Suspension of Trading</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
August 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of adequate and accurate information concerning
the securities of Latin American Resources, Inc. (``LARI''), of Huntington Station, New York, and that questions
have been raised about the accuracy and adequacy of LARI's financial statements and other disclosures. The Commission
is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors require a suspension of trading in the securities
of the above-listed company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is ordered, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that trading in the securities
of the above-listed company, over-the-counter or otherwise, is suspended for the period from 9:15 a.m. (EDT), August
1, 1994 through 11:59 p.m. (EDT), on August 10, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Trust will offer the following twelve separately managed portfolios: the MFS OTC Series; MFS Growth Series;
MFS Research Series; MFS Growth With Income Series; MFS Total Return Series; MFS Utilities Series; MFS High Income
Series; MFS World Governments Series; MFS Strategic Fixed Income Series; MFS Bond Series; MFS Limited Maturity Series;
and MFS Money Market Series. The application states that, except for the MFS OTC Series, the MFS Utilities Series,
the MFS World Governments Series and the MFS Strategic Fixed Income Series, each of the portfolios of the Trust will
be diversified. Applicants incorporate by reference into the application the registration statement (File No.
33&hyph;74668) on Form N&hyph;1A of the Trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. MFS serves as the investment advisor to the portfolios of the Trust. MFS is a subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company
of Canada (U.S.), which is a subsidiary of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants state that once the order requested in the application is granted, the Trust intends to offer shares
of each of its existing and future portfolios to separate accounts of insurance companies in addition to the separate
accounts established by Century Life of America (``Century Life'') or its affiliates (the ``Accounts'') to serve
as investment vehicles for variable annuity and/or variable life insurance contracts (the ``Contracts''). The
Trust may also offer shares of its portfolios directly to the Plans outside of the separate account context.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The application states that each Participating Insurance Company will have the legal obligation of satisfying
all applicable requirements under both state and federal law. Applicants state that it is anticipated that Participating
Insurance Companies will rely on Rule 6e&hyph;2 or Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act, although some may rely on
individual exemptive orders as well, in connection with variable life insurance contracts. Applicants further
state that the role of the Funds, in so far as the federal securities laws are applicable, will be limited to that of offering
shares to the Accounts and meeting any conditions that the Commission may impose upon granting the order requested
in the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The application states that, due to changes in the tax law, the Funds have the opportunity to increase their asset
base through sale of shares of the Funds to the Plans. The Plans may choose any of the Funds as the sole investment option,
or, as one of several investment options. Shares of any of the Funds sold to a Plan would be held by the trustee of that
Plan as required by Section 403(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA''). MFS will not
serve as investment advisor to any of the Plans that purchase shares of the Funds. There will be no pass-through voting
to participants in the Plans.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. In connection with the funding a scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate
account registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust (``UIT''), Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides partial
exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The relief provided by Rule 6e&hyph;2 is available
to a separate account's investment advisor, principal underwriter, and sponsor or depositor. The exemptions granted
by rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) are available only where the management investment company underlying the UIT offers its
shares ``exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life
insurance company.'' The use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both
variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of a single insurance company (or of two or more affiliated
insurance companies) is referred to as ``mixed funding.'' The use of a common management investment company as the
underlying investment medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated
insurance companies is referred to as ``shared funding.'' ``Mixed and shared funding'' denotes the use of a common
management investment company to fund the variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of other
affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies. The relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not available
with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund
that offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same company or of any other affiliated or unaffiliated
life insurance company. Therefore, Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) precludes mixed and shared funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the
Funds by the Plans. Applicants note, however, that because the relief under Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) is available only
where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of
the Funds also are to be sold to Plans.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. In connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered
under the 1940 Act as a UIT, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a),
and 15(b) of the 1940 Act. The exemptions granted to a separate account by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) are available
only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment
companies which offer their shares ``exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life
insurance company, offering either scheduled or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to
variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company.'' Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)
permits mixed funding. Rule 6e&hyph;3(T), however, does not permit shared funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants state that the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) is not affected by the purchase of shares of the Funds
by the Plans. Applicants note, however, that because the relief under Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) is available only where shares
are offered exclusively to separate accounts, additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the Funds are
also to be sold to Plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. As noted, Applicants state that changes in the tax law have created the opportunity for the Funds to increase their
asset base through the sale of Fund shares to the Plans. Applicants state that Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of the
Contracts held in the Funds. The Code provides that such Contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life
insurance contract for any period in which the investments are not, in accordance with regulations prescribed by
the Treasury Department, adequately diversified. On March 2, 1989, the Treasury Department issued regulations
which established diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts.
Treas. Reg. &sect;1.817&hyph;5 (1989). The regulations provide that, to meet the diversification requirements,
all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more
insurance companies. The regulations do, however, contain certain exceptions to this requirement, one of which
allows shares in an investment company to be held by the trustee of a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely
affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance
companies in connection with their variable contracts. Treas. Reg. &sect;1.817&hyph;5(f)(3)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants state that the promulgation of Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) under the 1940 Act preceded the issuance
of these Treasury regulations. Applicants assert that, given the then current tax law, the sale of shares of the same
investment company to both separate accounts and Plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of
Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Applicants therefore request relief from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)
and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the Funds to be offered and sold in
connection with both mixed and shared funding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment advisor or principal
underwriter of any registered open-end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a
disqualification enumerated in Sections 9(a) (1) or (2). Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provide
exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to limitations on mixed and shared funding. The
relief provided by Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(i) permits a person disqualified under
Section 9(a) to serve as an officer, director, or employee or the life insurer, or of any of its affiliates, so long as
that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund. The relief
provided by Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(ii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(ii) permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying
fund's investment advisor or principal underwriter, provided that none of the insurer's personnel who are ineligible
pursuant to Section 9(a) are participating in the management or administration of the fund.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants state that the partial relief from Section 9(a) found in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15),
in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate
in light of the policy and purposes of the Section. Applicant state that those 1940 Act rules recognize that it is not
necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940
Act to apply the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom
will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies within that organization. Applicants note
that the Participating Insurance Companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration
of the Funds. Therefore, Applicants assert, applying the restrictions of Section 9(a) serves no regulatory purpose.
The application states that the relief requested will not be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the Funds to
the Plans. The insulation of the Trust from individuals disqualified under the 1940 Act remains in place. Applicants
assert that, since the Plans are not investment companies and will not be deemed affiliated by virtue of their share
holdings, no additional relief is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act assume the existence of a pass-through
voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account. The application
states that the Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Contract
owners so long as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require such privileges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from the pass-through
voting requirement with respect to several significant matters, assuming observance of the limitations on mixed
and shared funding imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(A) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(A) provide that the insurance company may disregard
voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund, or any contract
between a fund and its investment advisor, when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15)(iii)(b) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15)(iii)(B) provide that the insurance company may disregard
voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in the company's investment
policies, principal underwriter, or any investment advisor, provided that disregarding such voting instructions
is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs (b)(15)(ii) and (b)(7)(ii) (B) and (C) of each rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants represent that the right of the Participating Insurance Companies to disregard voting instructions
of Contract owners provided by Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) does not raise any issues different
from those raised by the authority of state insurance administrators over separate accounts. Under the rules, an
insurer can disregard voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items. Affiliation does not eliminate
the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment
policies, principal underwriter, or investment advisor initiated by contract owners. The potential for disagreement
is limited by the requirements in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) that the insurance company's disregard of voting
instructions be both reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Applicants further represent that the Funds' sale of shares to the Plans does not impact the relief requested in
this regard. As noted previously by Applicants, shares of the Funds sold to Plans would be held by the trustees of such
Plans as required by Section 403(a) of ERISA. Section 403(a) also provides that the trustee(s) must have exclusive
authority and discretion to manage and control the Plan with two exceptions: (a) when the Plan expressly provides
that the trustee(s) is (are) subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee, in which case the trustee(s)
is (are) subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the Plan and not contrary to ERISA; and (b)
when the authority to manage, acquire or dispose of assets of the Plan is delegated to one or more investment mangers
pursuant to Section 402(c)(3) of ERISA. Unless one of the two exceptions stated in Section 403(a) applies, Plan trustees
have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies. Where a named fiduciary appoints an investment
manger, the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares
is reserved to the trustees or to the named fiduciary. In any event, there is no pass-through voting to the participants
in such Plans. According, Applicants note that, unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts, the issue
of the resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts with respect to voting is not present with Plans because such
Plans are not entitled to pass-through voting privileges.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Applicants state that no increased conflicts of interest would be present by the granting of the requested relief.
Applicants assert that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance
company is licensed to do business in several states. Applicants note that where Participating Insurance Companies
are domiciled in different states, it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one Participating
Insurance Company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of insurance regulators
in one or more other states in which other Participating Insurance Companies are domiciled. Applicants state that
the possibility, however, is no different and no greater than exists where, as is currently permitted, a single insurer
and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several states.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants argue that affiliation does not reduce the potential, if any exists, for differences in state regulatory
requirements. In any event, the conditions (adapted from the conditions included in Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15))
discussed below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that different state insurance regulatory
requirements may produce. If a particular state insurance regulator's decision conflicts with the majority of other
state regulators, the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its separate account's investment in the relevant
Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Applicants also argue that affiliation does not eliminate the potential, if any exists, for divergent judgments
as to when a Participating Insurance Company properly may disregard voting instructions of Contract owners. Potential
disagreement is limited by the requirement that a disregard of voting instructions be both reasonable and based on
specified good faith determinations. However, if a Participating Insurance Company's decision to disregard Contract
owner instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change,
such Participating Insurance Company may be required, at the election of the relevant Fund, to withdraw its investment
in that Fund. No charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Applicants state that there is no reason why the investment policies of a Fund with mixed funding would or should
be materially different from what those policies would or should be if such investment company or series thereof funded
only variable annuity or only variable life insurance contracts. Applicants therefore argue that there is no reason
to believe that conflicts of interest would result from mixed funding. Moreover, Applicants represent that the Funds
will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of Contact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Applicants note that no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular insurance
product. Each pool of variable annuity and variable life insurance contract owners is composed of individuals of
diverse financial status, age, insurance and investment goals. Those diversities are of greater significance than
any difference in insurance products. An investment company supporting even one type of insurance product must accommodate
those diverse factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. Applicants further note that Section 817(h) of the Code is the only section in the Code where separate accounts
are discussed. Section 817(h) imposes certain diversification standards on the underlying assets of variable annuity
contracts and variable life contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies. Treasury Regulation
1.817&hyph;5(f)(3)(iii), which established diversification requirements for such portfolios, specifically
permits, among other things, ``qualified pension or retirement plans'' and separate accounts to share the same underlying
management investment company. Therefore, neither the Code, the Treasury regulations nor the revenue rulings thereunder
present any inherent conflicts of interest if Plans, variable annuity separate accounts and variable life insurance
separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. While there are differences in the manner in which distributions are taxed for variable annuity contracts, variable
life insurance contracts and Plans, Applicants state that the tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest.
When distributions are to be made, and the separate account or the Plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the
distributions, that separate account or the Plan will redeem shares of the Trust at net asset value. The plan will then
make distributions in accordance with the terms of the Plan. The life insurance company will surrender values from
the separate account into the general account to make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. With respect to voting rights, applicants state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving such
voting rights to Contract owners and to Plans. Applicants represent that the transfer agent for the Trust will inform
each Participating Insurance Company of each Account's share of ownership in the Trust, as well as inform the trustees
of the Plans of their holdings. Each Participating Insurance Company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance
with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. Applicants argue that the ability of Funds to sell their respective shares directly to Plans does not create a ``senior
security'', as such term is defined under Section 18(g) of the 1940 Act, with respect to any Contract owner vis-a-vis
a participant under a Plan. Regardless of the rights and benefits of participants and Contract owners under the respective
Plans and Contracts, the Plans and the Accounts have rights only with respect to their shares of the Trust. Such shares
may be redeemed only at net asset value. No shareholder of any of the Funds has any preference over any other shareholder
with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. Finally, applicants state that there are no conflicts between Contract owners and participants under the Plans
with respect to the state insurance commissioners' veto powers (direct with respect to variable life insurance and
indirect with respect to variable annuities) over investment objectives. The basic premise of shareholder voting
is that not all shareholders may agree that there are any inherent conflicts of interest between shareholders. The
state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power in recognition of the fact that insurance companies
cannot simply redeem their separate accounts out of one fund and invest those monies in another fund. To accomplish
such redemption and transfers, complex time consuming transactions must be undertaken. Conversely, trustees of
Plans can make the decision quickly and implement redemption of shares from a Fund and reinvest the monies in another
funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments or, as is the case with most Plans, hold cash pending suitable
investment. Based on the foregoing, Applicants represent that even should there arise issues where the interests
of Contract owners and the interests of Plans conflict, the issues can be almost immediately resolved because trustees
of the Plans can, independently, redeem shares out of the Trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. Applicants state that various factors have kept certain insurance companies from offering variable annuity
and variable life insurance contracts. According to Applicants, these factors include: The cost of organizing and
operating an investment funding medium; the lack of expertise with respect to investment management (particularly
with respect to stock and money market investments); and the lack of public name recognition of certain insurers as
investment professionals. Applicants argue that use of the Funds as common investment media for the Contracts would
ameliorate these concerns. Participating Insurance Companies would benefit from the investment and administrative
expertise of MFS as well as from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds.
Applicants state that making the Funds available for mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies
to offer variable contracts such as the Contracts which will then increase competition with respect to both the design
and the pricing of variable contracts. This can be expected to result in greater product variation and lower charges.
Thus, Applicants argue that Contract owners would benefit because mixed and shared funding will eliminate a significant
amount of the costs of establishing and administering separate funds. Moreover, Applicants assert that sales of
shares of the Funds to Plans should increase the amount of assets available for investment by the Funds. This should,
in turn, promote economies of scale, permit increased safety of investments through greater diversification, and
make the addition of new portfolios to the Trust more feasible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Applicants believe that there is no significant legal impediment to permitting mixed and shared funding. Additionally,
Applicants note the previous issuance of an order permitting mixed and shared funding where shares of a trust were
sold directly to qualified plans.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants have consented to the following conditions if the requested order is granted:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A majority of the Board of Trustees or Board of Directors of each Fund (each, a ``Board'') shall consist of persons
who are not ``interested persons'' of the Fund, as defined by Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder
and as modified by any applicable orders of the Commission, except that, if this condition is not met by reason of the
death, disqualification, or bona fide resignation of any trustee or director, then the operation of this condition
shall be suspended: (a) for a period of 45 days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the Board; (b) for a period
of 60 days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies; or (c) for such longer period as the
Commission may prescribe by order upon application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Each Board will monitor its Fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between the interests
of the Contract owners of all of the Accounts investing in the Fund. A material irreconcilable conflict may arise for
a variety of reasons, including: (a) an action by any state insurance regulatory authority; (b) a change in applicable
federal or state insurance, tax, or securities laws or regulations, or a public ruling, private letter ruling, no-action
or interpretative letter, or any similar action by insurance, tax, or securities regulatory authorities; (c) an
administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding; (d) the manner in which the investments of the Fund
are managed; (e) a difference in voting instructions given by owners of variable annuity contracts and owners of variable
life insurance contracts; or (f) a decision by an insurer to disregard the voting instructions of Contract owners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Participating Insurance Companies and MFS (or any other investment advisor of a Fund) will report any potential
or existing conflicts to the Board. Participating Insurance Companies and MFS (or any other investment advisor of
a Fund) will be responsible for assisting the appropriate Board in carrying out its responsibilities under these
conditions by providing the Board with all information reasonably necessary for the Board to consider any issues
raised, including information as to a decision by a Participating Insurance Company to disregard voting instructions
of Contract owners. The responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the Board will be a contractual
obligation of the Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Funds
and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of Contract owners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If it is determined by a majority of the Board, or by a majority of its disinterested trustees or directors, that an
irreconcilable material conflict exists, the relevant Participating Insurance Companies shall, at their expense
and to the extent reasonably practicable, take steps necessary to remedy or eliminate the irreconcilable material
conflict, including: (a) withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the Accounts from the Fund and reinvesting
such assets in a different investment medium including another portfolio of the Fund or another Fund, or submitting
the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected contract owners; and, as
appropriate, segregating the assets of any appropriate group (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, variable annuity contract owners or variable life insurance contract owners) that votes in favor of such segregation,
or offering to the affected variable contract owners the option of making such a change; and (b) establishing a new
registered management investment company or managed separate account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a Board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict
and to bear the cost of such remedial action shall be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies
under the agreements governing their participation in the Funds. The responsibility to take such remedial action
shall be carried out with a view only to the interests of Contract owners. For purposes of this Condition Four, a majority
of the disinterested members of the applicable Board shall determine whether any proposed action adequately remedies
any material irreconcilable conflict, but, in no event will the Fund or MFS be required to establish a new funding medium
for any Contract. Further, no Participating Insurance Company shall be required by this Condition Four to establish
a new funding medium for any Contract if any offer to do so has been declined by a vote of a majority of the affected Contract
owners.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Board's determination of the existence of an irreconcilable material conflict and its implications shall
be made known promptly and in writing to all Participating Insurance Companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Participating Insurance Companies will provide pass-through voting privileges to all Contract owners so long
as the Commission interprets the 1940 Act to require pass-through voting privileges for Contract owners. Accordingly,
the Participating Insurance Companies will vote shares of the Fund held in their Accounts in a manner consistent with
voting instructions timely received from Contract owners. Participating Insurance Companies will be responsible
for assuring that each of their Accounts calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with other Participating
Insurance Companies. The obligation to calculate voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other Accounts
will be a contractual obligation of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing their
participation in the Funds. Each Participating Insurance Company will vote shares for which it has not received voting
instructions as well as shares attributable to it in the same proportion as it votes shares for which it has received
instructions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. All reports received by the Board of potential or existing conflicts, and all Board action with regard to: (a) determining
the existence of a conflict; (b) notifying Participating Insurance Companies of a conflict; and (c) determining
whether any proposed action adequately remedies a conflict, will be properly recorded in the minutes of the Board
or other appropriate records. Such minutes or other records shall be made available to the Commission upon request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Each Fund will notify all Participating Insurance Companies that separate account prospectus disclosure regarding
potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate. Each Fund shall disclose in its prospectus that: (a)
shares of the Fund are offered in connection with mixed and shared funding; (b) material conflicts may arise from mixed
and shared funding arrangements; and (c) the Board will monitor for the existence of any material conflicts and determine
what action, if any, should be taken in response to such conflicts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Each Fund will comply with all provisions of the 1940 Act requiring voting by shareholders, and, in particular,
each Fund will either provide for annual meetings (except to the extent that the Commission may interpret Section
16 of the 1940 Act not to require such meetings) or comply with Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act, (although the Funds are
not within the trusts described in Section 16(c) of the 1940 Act) as well as with Section 16(a), and, if applicable,
Section 16(b) of the 1940 Act. Further, each Fund will act in accordance with the Commission's interpretation of the
requirements of Section 16(a) with respect to periodic elections of trustees and with whatever rules the Commission
may promulgate with respect thereto.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. If and to the extent that Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) are amended (or if Rule 6e&hyph;3 under the 1940 Act is
adopted) to provide exemptive relief from any provision of the 1940 Act or the rules thereunder with respect to mixed
and shared funding on terms and conditions materially different from any exemptions granted in the order requested
by Applicants, then the Funds and the Participating Insurance Companies, as appropriate, shall take such steps as
may be necessary to comply with Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T), as amended, and Rule 6e&hyph;3, as adopted, to the
extent applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. No less than annually, the Participating Insurance Companies and/or MFS (or any other investment advisor of a
Fund) shall submit to the Boards such reports, materials, or data as the Board may reasonably request so that the Boards
may carry out fully the obligations imposed by the conditions contained in the application. Such reports, materials,
and data shall be submitted more frequently if deemed appropriate by the Boards. The obligations of the Participating
Insurance Companies to provide these reports, materials, and data to the Boards shall be a contractual obligation
of all Participating Insurance Companies under the agreements governing participation in the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. If a Plan should become an owner of 10% or more of the assets of a Fund, such Plan will execute a fund participation
agreement with the applicable Fund. A Plan will execute an application containing an acknowledgment of this condition
upon such Plan's initial purchase of shares of any Fund.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons stated above, Applicants believe that the requested exemptions, in accordance with the standards

fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Applicant's Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. OFA is a statutory authority of the Province of Ontario (``Ontario'' or the ``Province'') established on November
15, 1993 by the Province under the Capital Investment Plan Act, 1993 (the ``Capital Investment Act''). The Province
established OFA to assist the Province, and municipalities, school boards, post-secondary institutions, hospitals
and other public bodies (the ``Public Sector Clients'') to borrow and invest money, and provide other financial services.
Through OFA, money will be raised to finance capital investment in the areas of, among others, education, health-care,
transportation, and water and sewage infrastructure. OFA is expected to become a major financing vehicle for borrowing
by Public Sector Clients.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. OFA proposes to issue and sell in the United States debt securities unconditionally guaranteed by the Province
(``Guaranteed Debt Securities''). The proceeds of the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be lent to various Public
Sector Clients. Substantially all of the moneys borrowed by OFA will be re-lent to the Public Sector Clients. Funds
not immediately lent to the Province or Public Sector Clients will be invested by OFA. In order to assure favorable
terms to the Public Sector Clients, and in anticipation of their borrowing needs, OFA may borrow and then invest the
proceeds of such borrowings temporarily in debt instruments, such as banker's acceptances, Treasury bills, and
commercial paper until the Public Sector Clients require such funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Guaranteed Debt Securities will be direct, unsecured obligations of OFA, with the payment of principal, and any
interest or premium, irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province (the ``Provincial Guarantee'')
pursuant to an order of the Lieutenant Governor in Council under the Financial Administration Act (the ``FAA'').
Section 22 of the FAA provides, in part, that the Lieutenant Governor in Council may by order authorize the Minister
of Finance, on behalf of Ontario, ``to agree to guarantee or indemnify the debts, obligations, securities or undertakings
of any person *&blank;*&blank;* [and] may fix such terms and conditions as are considered advisable *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Pursuant to this authority, Guaranteed Debt Securities will bear the irrevocable unconditional guarantee of the
Province so that, in the event of a default, holders of Guaranteed Debt Securities may proceed directly against the
Province under such guarantee without first proceeding against OFA, and such amount will then be payable out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Province.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Capital Investment Act is the primary legislation governing OFA and sets out OFA's constitution, functions,
and powers. The Minister of Finance of the Province is responsible for the administration of the Capital Investment
Act in respect of OFA. Pursuant to the Capital Investment Act, OFA is required to submit an annual report on its affairs,
including audited financial statements, to the Minister of Finance within 90 days of the end of its fiscal year. The
financial statements are audited by the Provincial Auditor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Lieutenant Governor in Council is empowered to make regulations respecting the management, control, and administration
of the affairs of OFA. OFA's board of directors may pass by-laws regulating OFA's proceedings, specifying the powers
and duties of the officers and employees and generally for the management of OFA. In particular, the power of OFA to
borrow, issue securities, make short-term investments, manage risk associated with financing and investment,
or incur liabilities in order to facilitate financings by others only may be exercised under the authority of a by-law
that has been approved by the Minister of Finance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Substantially all of OFA's assets are expected to include: (i) Obligations of Public Sector Clients to repay loans
made to them by OFA; (ii) the assets, consisting primarily of deposit obligations, of The Province of Ontario Savings
Office; (iii) obligations of certain Public Sector Clients to repay loans made to them by the Province and transferred
to OFA; (iv) investments to facilitate OFA's cash flow management and maximize the return on its surplus funds and
those of Public Sector Clients; and (v) such other assets, which may consist of obligations or investments, as permitted
by the Capital Investment Act.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 3(a)(3) of the Act defines an investment company as an issuer engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owning ``investment securities'' having a value exceeding 40% of
the value of such issuer's total assets. Because substantially all of the moneys borrowed by OFA will be lent to Public
Sector Clients, a substantial portion of OFA's assets will consist of obligations of the Public Sector Clients to
repay such loans. In addition, OFA will invest its own surplus funds and those of other Public Sector Clients, as well
as make temporary investments. Such obligations and investments could be deemed to be ``investment securities''
within the meaning of section 3(a)(3). As a result, OFA could be deemed to be an ``investment company'' under the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to grant an exemption from the provisions of the Act if and to the extent that such exemption
is necessary and appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors, and consistent
with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. OFA believes that granting the exemption would be appropriate in the public interest. It would benefit United States
investors by making the Guaranteed Debt Securities more readily available to such investors. It also would expand
the United States' market for OFA's Guaranteed Debt Securities and thus encourage the free flow of capital among nations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. OFA further believes that granting the exemption requested would be consistent with the protection of investors.
The payment of the principal of, and any premium or interest on, the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be irrevocably
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Province. As a result, the Guaranteed Debt Securities will be backed by the
sovereign credit of the Province and not merely the credit and assets of OFA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Finally, OFA believes an exemption would be consistent with the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act. OFA is a governmental central financing and investing authority that was organized to obtain and arrange
efficient financing and investments for the requirements of public authorities of the Province. OFA is thus a statutory
body with characteristics different from the types of investment companies at which the Act generally is directed
and for which its substantive provisions are necessary or suitable.

Applicant's Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OFA agrees that any order of the SEC granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. No Guaranteed Debt Securities will be offered or sold within the United States unless: (a) They are registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act''); (b) in the opinion of United States counsel for OFA, an exemption

Applicant's Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant is an open-end diversified management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. On March
4, 1988, applicant registered as an investment company under the Act, and filed a registration statement on Form N&hyph;1A
under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement became effective on July 13,
1988, and applicant's initial public offering commenced immediately thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On February 16,1994, applicant's board of directors approved an agreement and plan of reorganization (the ``Plan'')
between applicant and TCW Funds, Inc. (``TCW Funds''), a registered, open-end management company. The Plan provided
for the transfer of all of the assets and liabilities of applicant's sole series, the Money Market Portfolio, in exchange
for shares of TCW Galileo Money Market Fund (``Galileo''), a series of TCW Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Definitive proxy materials relating to the Plan were filed with the SEC on March 23, 1994, and proxy materials were
mailed to applicant's on or about March 25, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On April 6, 1994, the SEC issued an order
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 permitting applicant to exchange its assets and liabilities for shares of Galileo, provided that applicant's shareholders
approved the exchange. In the application requesting that order, it was stated that the reason for the reorganization
was to help reduce overall operating expenses because of economies of scale achieved by spreading certain management
and administrative expenses over a larger asset base. Applicant's shareholders voted to approve the Plan at a special
meeting of applicant's shareholders on April 20, 1994.

and a per share net asset value of $1.00. On May 23, 1994, pursuant to the Plan, applicant transferred all of its assets
and liabilities to the TCW Funds, Inc. in exchange for shares of Galileo. The aggregate net asset value of the Galileo
shares received was equal to the net asset value of applicant's shares held. Applicant then distributed the Galileo
shares it received

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. No brokerage commissions were paid in connection with the reorganization. The expenses applicable to the Plan,
consisting of accounting, printing, administrative, and certain legal expenses, are estimated to be approximately
$10,000. These expenses have been or will be paid by TCW Funds Management, Inc., applicant's investment adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party

business activities other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Missouri Highway and Transportation Department (MHTD) and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve a portion of Missouri Route
13 in Henry, Johnson and Lafayette Counties, Missouri. Improvements would involve the reconstruction of existing
Route 13 from Lexington to south of Clinton, a total distance of approximately 154.7 kilometers (70 miles).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed improvement is considered necessary to meet anticipated traffic demand and to improve roadway safety.
The project would serve as an alternative access to Whiteman Air Force Base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In Missouri, alternatives under consideration include (1) a ``no build'' option, (2) improvement of the existing
alignment, and (3) alternatives on new alignments. Authorization pursuant to Section 404 of the Clean Water Act will
be required. Concurrent with preparation of the EIS, the Corps of Engineers will evaluate the alternatives and associated
impacts that would result from the project. Comments received during the EIS process will be considered by the Corps
of Engineers in the evaluation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. To date, preliminary information has been issued to local officials and other interested parties. The scoping
process has been initiated with Federal, State, and local agencies. A formal scoping meeting is scheduled for August
10, 1994, in Warrensburg, Missouri. In addition, public hearings will be held. Public notice will be given in advance
of the date and time of each meeting. The draft EIS will be available prior to the public hearing for public review and
comment. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant
issues identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Any comments or questions
concerning this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or the Missouri Highway and Transportation
Department at the addresses provided above.

the nature of the relief being requested and the petitioner's arguments in favor of relief.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BN seeks a waiver of compliance from certain sections of the Railroad Safety Appliance Standards (49 CFR Part 231).
BN states that it will be building one trainset of its ``trough train'' equipment. This train will be composed of 22
13-section cars. The parking brakes on these cars are of conventional design, but their location is not standard.
The unique size and design of one 13-section car does not allow the conventional application of a handbrake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BN requests a waiver from 49 CFR 231.1(a)(1), 231.1(a)(3)(i), and 231.1(a)(3)(ii). Section 231.1(a)(1) requires
that there be one efficient handbrake which shall operate in harmony with the power brake installed on the car. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BN states that the 13-section trough train car has 14 truck assemblies; 2 single axle trucks and 12 two axle trucks.
It is impossible to brake a minimum of half the total axles under the 13-section car from one parking brake location.
A much more positive brake is provided by the proposed system that has each parking brake holding 2 two axle trucks.
No active linkage cross any articulation under this system. The system uses a minimum of 4 parking brakes that brake
16 axles out of the 24 axle total. The 13-section trough train car requires more than one parking brake per car to safely
hold the car when stopped. There are many cars that operate successfully with more than one handbrake, such as heavy
duty flat cars, articulated intermodal cars and stand alone intermodal cars connected into groups with drawbars.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 231.1(a)(3)(i) requires that the handbrake be so located that it can be safely operated while the car is in
motion. BN states that the long length of a trough train car 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(278 feet) necessitates multiple parking brakes to hold the car safely on grades and direct simple parking brake connections
to the individual trucks and axles, requires that multiple parking brakes be applied along the length of the car. Four
parking brakes per car is proposed. The location of the parking brakes does not lend itself to making provisions for
the brake to be operated while the car is in motion. The design of the car will not allow the application of a standard
handbrake to safely allow a man to ride the car while setting the brake. These cars are specifically designed for unit
train operation and will be used in services where the train is loaded and unloaded in full trains or large blocks of
cars, while coupled to and under the control of a locomotive. The parking brakes are designed to hold the car once stopped,
on any practical grade for whatever reason. The safety of employees is enhanced by allowing them to apply the brake
from the ground, without the need to climb onto the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BN has had a policy in effect for several years that prohibits anyone from mounting or dismounting any freight car,
caboose, or locomotive while it is moving. The application of parking brakes on this type of car will only be done while
the car is stopped. A waiver is requested that allows the operation of the parking brake only when the car is stopped.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 231.1(a)(3)(ii) requires that the brake shaft be located on end of car, to the left of and not less than 17 nor
more than 22 inches from center. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BN states that due to the design of the car and the need to operate the parking brake from the ground, it is imperative
that the brake wheel and mechanism be mounted in such a way as to make its operation as safe as possible. The brake wheel
and mechanism has been mounted as low as the car design will allow (approximately 3-foot 10 inches from the top of the
rail to the bottom of the wheel rim) and as close to the side of the car as possible (52 inches to the center of the brake
shaft from the center of the car.) This location allows the brake to be easily operated from the ground while the car
is stopped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BN states the trough train provides the latest advancements in slackless technology, car geometry, aerodynamics
and safety.

Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 402(e) allows taxpayers to compute a separate tax on a lump-sum distribution
from a qualified retirement plan. Form 4972 is used to correctly figure that tax. The data is used to verify the correctness
of the separate tax. Form 4972 is also used to make the special 20% capital gain election attributable to pre-1974 participation
from the lump-sum distribution.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1505 and Treasury Decision 85&hyph;93, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 29, 1985 (50 FR 21832), the interest rate paid on applicable overpayments or underpayments of Customs duties
shall be in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code rate established under 26 U.S.C. 6621 and 6622. Interest rates
are determined based on the short-term Federal rate. The interest rate that Treasury pays on overpayments will be
the short-term Federal rate plus two percentage points. The interest rate paid to the Treasury for underpayments
will be the short-term Federal rate plus three percentage points. The rates will be rounded to the nearest full percentage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interest rates are determined by the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury based
on the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the U.S. with remaining periods to maturity
of 3 years or less, and fluctuate quarterly. The rates effective for a quarter are determined during the first- month
period of the previous quarter. The rates of interest for the period of July 1, 1994&hyph;September 30, 1994, are 7
percent for overpayments and 8 percent for underpayments. These rates will remain in effect through September 30,
1994, and are subject to change on October 1, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice lists those areas for which EPA had previously issued a finding, under the Clean Air Act (Act), and for which
the 18-month mandatory sanction clock had expired on or before July 15, 1994 or is projected to expire through August
31, 1994. If these areas do not correct the outstanding deficiencies before the effective date of the ``Selection
of Sequence of Mandatory Sanctions Rule'' (sanctions rule), which is found in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the rules section and becomes effective September 6, 1994, these areas would be subject to sanctions. The sanctions
rule describes in detail the process by which sanctions will apply to areas that do not meet deadlines specified in
the Act and for which findings are made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted in the list, the vast majority of areas plan to take corrective action before the sanctions rule goes into effect.
However, any area that does not take the required action before that time will be subject to the 2 to 1 emissions offset
sanction (offset sanction) as provided by the Act. Futhermore, in most cases, if EPA has not determined that the deficiency
has been corrected within 6 months of the imposition of the offset sanction, the second sanction, affecting Federal
highway funding, will also apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The table below lists those areas with active sanctions clocks resulting from a finding. This table should not be used
as the sole guide to determine which areas will be subject to sanctions when the sanctions rule goes into effect. In
fact, it is likely that today's list may be obsolete with respect to many areas by the effective date of the sanctions
rule because these areas will have corrected the relevant deficiency by that date. It is important to note that the
enclosed table reflects only those areas for which clocks had expired as of July 15, 1994 or is projected to expire through
August 31, 1994. There are other sanctions clocks running under the Act (e.g., any area that has not yet made a complete
submission to EPA for State implementation plan (SIP) elements due on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 15, 1993). In the future, other sanction clocks will be initiated if EPA finds that a State has failed to make
a required submittal, if EPA determines that a State submittal is incomplete, if EPA disapproves a State submission,
or if a State fails to implement an approved plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA will periodically provide the public with access to updated information through the Office of Air Quality
Planning and Standards' Technology Transfer Network computer bulletin board system and through updates of this
information in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These updates will indicate cases in which sanctions have been deferred or stayed, delete areas for which EPA has
made a final determination that the deficiencies prompting the findings have been corrected, and add additional
areas as findings are made triggering sanctions clocks. Furthermore, EPA will publish a notice with a similar table,
as appropriate, for areas that later may be subject to the highway sanction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each area potentially subject to the offset sanction on the effective date of the sanctions rule, the table below
identifies the State, the affected area, the type of finding the area received, the SIP element, the pollutants affected
by the offset sanction, the date the sanctions clock expires, and the corrective actions needed to stop the sanctions
clock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Affected Area'' column lists the area in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the offset sanction would apply if the deficiencies are not corrected by the effective date of the sanctions
rule. For more information on the boundaries of any listed area, the public can refer to 40 CFR part 81, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which sets forth the designations for areas and establishes their boundaries. Footnoted areas are included because
a SIP submittal was disapproved. All other areas are included as a result of a finding of nonsubmittal or incompleteness.
The full set of letters reflecting the findings of nonsubmittal or incompleteness that EPA has already issued can
be found in Air Docket A&hyph;94&hyph;41. Please refer to the sanctions rule for a discussion on the significance
of finding type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``State Implementation Plan Element'' column describes the SIP element on which the finding was based. Abbreviations
are as follows: VOC_volatile organic compounds, CO_carbon monoxide, NOx_nitrogen oxides, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PM&hyph;10_particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers. The SIP
elements and their respective sections in the Act are as follows: VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology Fix-ups_section
182(a)(2)(A); PM&hyph;10 SIP Attainment Demonstration_section 189(a); Emission Statements_section 182(a)(3)(B);
PM&hyph;10 New Source Review_sections 172(c)(5) and 189(a)(1)(A); Basic Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance_for
ozone, section 182(b)(4), and for CO, section 187(a)(4); Enhanced Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance_section
182(c)(3)(A); VOC Reasonably Available Control Technology Catch-up_section 182(b)(2); NOx Reasonably Available
Control Technology Rules_section 182(b)(2) and (f); Employer Commute Option Program_section 182(d)(2); Oxygenated
Fuels_for serious areas, section 187(b)(3) and for moderate areas, section 211(m); CO Contingency Measures_section
187(a)(3); CO Attainment Demonstration_section 187(a)(7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Pollutants Affected'' column describes which pollutants and their precursors would be affected should the
offset sanction be applied. The preamble of the sanctions rule explains when precursors will be subject to the offset
sanction. The ``Date Sanction Clock Expires'' column is the date the 18-month sanction clock expires. In the future,
this column will include information on the deferral and stay of any sanction under &sect;52.31(d) of the sanctions
rule. The ``Corrective Actions Needed'' column provides specific actions that must be completed to stop imposition
of sanctions for each area on the list.
